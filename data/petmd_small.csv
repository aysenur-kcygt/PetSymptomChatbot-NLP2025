But did you know that Lyme disease can affect cats as well? Lyme Disease and many other diseases are spread through tick bites and are known as tick-borne diseases. Ticks can be found anywhere in the United States and their bite can cause skin infections, anemia, and tick paralysis , which is a serious and life-threatening condition to cats. The six most common types of tick-borne diseases in cats include: Lyme disease : A bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi) spread through the bite of the black-legged (deer) tick; often found in the eastern U.S., and as far west as Texas and South Dakota. Hepatozoonosis : A protozoan that is spread through tick bites, this disease is not common in cats. Tularemia : A bacterium (Francisella tularensis) transmitted from the American dog tick and Lone Star tick; often found everywhere in the U.S., except the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest. This disease is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted to people and should be reported to public officials. Babesiosis (Piroplasmosis) : This is a protozoan (Babesia felis) that is spread through tick bites. It has not been reported in the U.S. but is more common in Southern Africa. Cytauxzoonosis : A protozoan (Cytauxzoonosis felis) transmitted from Lone Star ticks, it’s often found in the southern U.S. and as far north as Wisconsin and Maine. Anaplasmosis : A rickettsial organism (Anaplasma phagocytophilum) spread through the bite of the black-legged (deer) tick and the brown dog tick. It is most common in the eastern and southern U.S. and as far west as Texas and South Dakota. Tick-borne diseases are usually noticed within a few weeks after the original tick bite. Your cat may show symptoms including: Fever Lack of appetite Joint pain and swelling, lameness, and/or trouble walking Weight loss Lethargy Anemia (blood loss) and secondary bruising, which may be noticed as pale gums, bloody stools, and/or bloody nose Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, or gums) Large, painful, and swollen lymph nodes Irritation, redness, and itching around the bite site Changes in meow Difficulty swallowing Weakness or diminished movement that usually starts in your cat’s hindlimbs and quickly moves to its forelimbs and possibly the diaphragm. This is known as tick paralysis. Of the many species of ticks , only a handful cause significant disease in cats. These include: Brown dog tick Black-legged (deer) tick American dog tick Lone Star tick Your veterinarian will physically examine your cat and review the type and frequency of any tick prevention medications given. He or she may also recommend: Bloodwork (a complete blood cell count), urine testing, and X-rays to assess your cat’s overall health and rule out other diseases. Urine protein: Creatinine ratio test to screen for any underlying kidney damage. Cytology and analysis of any infected organs and/or joint fluid. PCR or antibody testing to detect the organism’s DNA. Analysis of the tick itself if you can pull it directly from the cat and store in a container to be examined by a veterinarian. It's important to check your cat monthly for ticks. Treatment of a tick-borne disease in cats often entails two to four weeks of antibiotics such as doxycycline . Supportive care such as pain medications, blood transfusions, anti-inflammatories, IV fluids, and appetite stimulants may also be necessary depending on the severity of symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine approved for use in cats at this time. Prognosis for recovery depends on the disease itself and the severity of symptoms. For cats suffering from tick paralysis, the prognosis is uncertain, as problems with swallowing and breathing can develop. Some diseases such as tularemia and cytauxzoonosis are relatively uncommon but are fatal if left untreated. Many cats that survive treatment can go on to live a relatively normal life, though they may be carriers of the disease and may need to be monitored frequently for possible sub-conditions that can develop such as Lyme nephritis (kidney disease). Prevention truly is the best medicine when it comes to ticks. Year-round tick control options for cats include dips, sprays, topicals, tablets, and even collars. Partner with your vet to determine the one that is the most beneficial for you and your cat. Remember, you’re not only preventing diseases to your cat but also to you and your household members. Ticks transmit many diseases to cats such as: cytauxzoonosis, tularemia, Lyme Disease, and anaplasmosis, to name a few. Absolutely. In addition to the numerous diseases that can be transmitted from ticks, they can also cause skin irritation and secondary infections, anemia from blood loss, and even a life-threatening condition called tick paralysis. The most common symptoms associated with tick bites include redness and itching at the bite site along with diseases that cause lameness, joint pain, fever, and decreased appetite.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_diaphragmatic_hernia,Abnormal Diaphragm Opening in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Diaphragmatic hernias occur when an abdominal organ (such as the stomach, liver, intestine, etc.) moves into an abnormal opening in the cat's diaphragm, the sheet of muscle separating the abdomen from the rib cage area. This can occur because of an acquired injury from a forceful blow, such as a car accident, or because of a defect at birth (congenital). The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Signs of a diaphragmatic hernia include irregular heartbeat, labored breathing (especially after a forceful blow) and symptoms of shock. The abdomen may move rapidly (palpitate) or feel empty. Reactions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and bloating can occur because of damage to the bowel or stomach. In congenital cases, the symptoms may not be evident immediately. Gradual symptoms include muffled heart sounds or heart murmurs, abdominal defects, and trouble breathing. Signs may occur suddenly with damage to the bowel, spleen, or liver. Most commonly, diaphragmatic hernia is caused by a trauma such as being hit by a car or other forceful blow. Therefore, diaphragmatic hernias occur most commonly with roaming outdoor cats. The pressure of such an impact causes a tear in the diaphragm, allowing an internal organ to protrude through the rip. The reason for congenital diaphragmatic hernias is not known, although certain breeds are more likely to develop this abnormality. Some breeds may be predisposed, Himalayan cats in particular show higher numbers of congenital diaphragmatic hernias. Other birth defects may be evident in cats born with a diaphragmatic hernia, and the condition may cause further problems including rib fractures, organ failure, and impaired lung expansion. The most useful diagnostic test is through the use of X-rays (radiographs) to reveal inner abnormalities. If this is insufficient, further imaging processes like ultrasounds may be used. Other symptoms that initially appear to be caused by a diaphragmatic hernia include a gathering of excess fluid in the space around the lungs or abnormally fast breathing due to other causes. For trauma-induced diaphragmatic hernias, the patient must be treated for shock and it is imperative that breathing and heart rate are stabilized before going into surgery. Surgery should repair damaged organs, as well as the tear in the diaphragm. It is important that the patient be stable before surgery begins, as surgery will not necessarily improve any heart or breathing problems. For congenital diaphragmatic hernias, surgery should be performed as soon as possible in order to avoid further damage to the animal’s internal organs. Again, it is important that breathing and heart rate are stabilized before operating. Drugs can be used to help stabilize heart rate. After surgery is complete, there are secondary problems to look out for. Monitoring of heart rate with a monitor (electrocardiograph) is advised to check for irregular heartbeat. Hyperthermia, or increased body temperature, is common in cats after surgery. Another common problem is swelling or fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema). Most animals survive when surgery is successful and all secondary effects are controlled. Older cats with trauma-induced hernias are less likely to survive surgery. There is no method to prevent congenital diaphragmatic hernias, although it is best to operate as soon as possible. To avoid traumatic experiences that may cause diaphragmatic hernias, it is best to keep pets away from potentially dangerous areas, such as streets where car accidents are likely to occur.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_rectoanal_polyps,Abnormal Growths in the Lower Intestines of Cats,"PetMD Editorial The growth of flap-like protrusions in the cat's anal and rectal walls is a condition referred to as rectoanal polyps. These polyps may be directly attached to the intestinal walls (sessile), or attached through a stalk-like cylindrical connection. Most rectoanal polyps are non-cancerous, and are merely extensions of the innermost tissue lining of the intestinal walls. And while most cases of polyps are usually isolated, there are occasions cats suffer from multiple polyps. The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how rectoanal polyps affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Cats suffering from rectoanal polyps will demonstrate straining or pain while passing stool. The stool may be stained with blood and/or covered with mucus. The exact cause of rectoanal polyps is not clearly known. However, rectoanal polyps are rare in cats, and neither breed nor gender increases the likelihood for contracting this disorder. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Some of the common tests include a complete blood count and a urinalysis, which will usually return as normal. Imaging tools, such as X-rays and ultrasounds, are not applicable to this particular diagnosis. Some conditions that may produce symptoms similar to those caused by polyps include abscesses, tumors, inflammation, infection of the intestine, and rectal prolapse. Diagnosis, therefore, is usually made on the basis of a manual rectal examination of the cat by a veterinarian, or by direct visualization of the polyp through the external anal opening. After a polyp is identified, a colonoscopy, using a tubular, flexible camera inserted through the anal opening, may be performed to check for the presence of other polyps. A detailed pathological study of the tissue, as well as the fluid from the polyp, may also be completed. Surgery is usually indicated for the effective management of polyps. The polyps may be removed through the anal opening, after which the anal opening will be closed with stitches. The same removal surgery may be performed endoscopically, or by using an electrical needle or probe. Some medications that may be prescribed are: Possible complications include a relapse of the polyps and narrowing of the anal opening due to scarring and/or inflammation. Your veterinarian will want to examine the surgical site after 14 days to make sure that the condition has been resolved and the tissue is healing properly. Another examination will be made at three months, and again at six months after surgery. Follow-up examinations will continue twice a year to check for recurrence. Fortunately, cats with single polyps usually do not relapse. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_arteriovenous_fistula,Abnormal Passage Between Artery and Vein in Cats,"PetMD Editorial An abnormal, low resistance connection between an artery and a vein is called an arteriovenous fistula. If large enough, the fistula may cause a significant fraction of the total cardiac output to bypass the capillary bed, making it so that the tissues receive little or no oxygen. The heart, in turn, tries to compensate for the lack of oxygen by pumping blood out to the body at a faster rate, which may lead “high output” congestive heart failure. The location of arteriovenous fistulae varies; reported sites include the head, neck, ear, tongue, limbs, flank, spinal cord, cerebrum (part of the brain), lung, liver, vena cava (major vein leading back to the heart), and gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms associated with an arteriovenous fistula will ultimately depend on the size and location of the fistula. Typically, there is a warm, non-painful at the site of the fistula. If the lesion is on a limb, the cat may display: Signs of congestive heart failure, which is often associated with this type of fistula, include: If the arteriovenous fistula causes organ failure, your cat may display: Cats are rarely born with arteriovenous fistulas. Typically, they acquire the fistula due to traumatic damage to blood vessels, surgery complications, tumor(s), or problems arising from drawing blood or injections around the blood vessels (e.g., barbiturates) You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to help identify complications associated with an arteriovenous fistula. Biochemical abnormalities, for example, may suggest liver, kidney or other organ dysfunction. Because arteriovenous fistulae significantly affect the cat's blood flow, thoracic x-rays may show enlargement of the heart and signs of over-circulation to the lungs. In addition, a Doppler ultrasound may show high-velocity, turbulent flow within the lesion. To locate the arteriovenous fistula, your veterinarian may employ an echocardiogram on the cat. And to outline the lesion, which may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and is highly desirable for presurgical evaluation, the veterinarian may use selective angiography Cats with clinical signs must undergo surgery to divide and remove abnormal connections between blood vessels. However, surgery can be difficult and labor-intensive and may require blood transfusions. Also, though often successful, the arteriovenous fistula may recur even after surgery. Some cats may even require amputation of the affected appendage. A newer treatment option called transcatheter embolization involves using a catheter to block blood vessels. This method is particularly advantageous because it is relatively noninvasive and provides access to remote lesions via the blood vessels. Your veterinarian will want to schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate your cat, especially if it underwent surgery. This will also enable him or her to determine whether the arteriovenous fistula has recurred. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/c_ct_oronasal_fistula,Abnormal Passageway Between the Mouth and Nasal Cavity in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A fistula is characterized as an abnormal passageway between two openings, hollow organs, or cavities. They occur as a result of injury, infection, or disease. A communicating, vertical passageway between the mouth and nasal cavity is called an oronasal fistula. Oronasal fistulas are rare in cats, but they do occur. These types of fistulas are caused by the diseased condition of any tooth in the upper jaw. The most common location for an oronasal fistula is where the root of the fourth premolar on the upper jaw enters the palate. This condition will need to be surgically corrected to prevent food and water from passing from the mouth into the nasal cavity. If this should occur, it will cause irritation of the nose, runny nose, inflammation of the sinuses, infection, and possibly pneumonia. The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Symptoms of an oronasal fistula include a chronically runny nose, with or without bleeding, and persistent sneezing. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and oral exam using a periodontal probe to investigate the suspected oronasal fistula. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. The blood-work should be done before anesthetizing the cat for surgical correction of the oronasal fistula. Surgical removal of the tooth, and closure of the passageway is the treatment of choice. A skin flap will be placed in both the mouth and in the nasal cavity during closure. Since a flap to repair an oronasal fistula undergoes constant tension each time the cat breathes, oronasal fistulae tend to reopen. Additional surgeries with advanced tissue flaps can be performed if this occurs. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_paraproteinemia,Abnormal Protein Production in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Gamma globulins, or immunoglobulins, are part of the body's antibody response to fighting infections. They are a class of blood protein produced by plasma cell, a type of white blood cell; their purpose: to identify and neutralize invading bacteria and viruses. In paraproteinemia, abnormal paraproteins (proteins in the blood or urine) or M components are produced by a single clone of plasma cells. Such production of abnormal proteins is commonly seen in plasma cell tumors and in some other types of tumors, as well as in plasma cell myeloma, a cancer of the white blood cells. It is rare in cats, but when it does occur, it is usually in older cats. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as infections, or contact with carcinogenic substances. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical examination, including routine laboratory testing. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood testing may reveal anemia, abnormally low levels of leukocytes or white blood cells (leukopenia), or abnormally low levels of platelets ( thrombocytopenia ). A biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of proteins in the blood, low levels of albumin (a type of protein), abnormally high levels of calcium (hypercalcemia), and high levels of urea and creatinine in the blood. The urinalysis may show the presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria). More specific testing will also be conducted to diagnose various diseases. Thoracic and abdominal X-rays will be taken to identify where lymphoma (cancer) is present. A sample of bone marrow may be taken, which will reveal more details associated with this disease. Similarly, samples from affected lymph nodes will also be taken to identify the type of cancer cells or infectious agents that are attacking the body. If your cat is diagnosed with paraproteinemia and associated cancer, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any other remedies recommended by your veterinary oncologist. Antibiotic therapy may also be conducted to treat underlying bacterial infections, if present. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines for chemotherapy medication at home, as these drugs are potentially toxic and should only be used under strict guidance from a veterinary oncologist.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_vesicourachal_diverticula,Abnormal Urine Outflow Due to Urinary Bladder Dysfunction in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Vesicourachal diverticula occurs when a fetus' urachus -- embryological canal or tube connecting the placenta with urinary bladder of fetus -- fails to close. This congenital condition impairs the animal's normal urine outflow and makes it susceptible to urinary tract infections. Moreover, the condition may persist indefinitely if not treated properly. Often, vesicouracahal deiverticula occurs in the womb or during the birthing process. However, there is also an acquired form of the condition, which results from diseases that put undue pressure on the bladder (e.g., bacterial urinary tract infections, uroliths, and urethral plugs). The acquired form is more common in cats with lower urinary tract disease; male cats are also at higher risk for vesicouracahal deiverticula than females. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which help identify the underlying cause of the condition and the present of concurrent disorders. The best tool for confirming diagnosis, however, is X-rays of the urethra and bladder while using contrast medium. The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of vesicourachal diverticula. Cats that do not respond to conventional treatment may require surgery to correct the defect. You will need to visit the veterinarian for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will take urine samples to evaluate the status of infection. Some animals will require long-term antibiotic therapy to combat urinary tract infections. However, overall prognosis in cats with vesicourachal diverticula is good after treatment.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pneumothorax,Accumulation of Air Between Chest and Lungs in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pneumothorax is the medical term for an accumulation of air in the area between the cat's chest wall and lungs (the pleural space). It may be categorized as traumatic or spontaneous, and closed or open. Both dogs and cats are susceptible to pneumothorax. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library. There are four main categories of pneumothorax: traumatic, spontaneous, closed, and open. Symptoms vary depending on the type of pneumothorax, though some common signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), shallow rapid breathing from the abdomen, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Traumatic pneumothorax, which occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and is due to some sort of trauma, such as a car accident, may be evident by the signs of shock. Cats with spontaneous pneumothorax, on the other hand, may show sings of lung disease. Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to a non-traumatic cause, and may be primary (meaning it occurs in the absence of some underlying lung disease) or secondary (meaning it is associated with some type of underlying lung disease). Open pneumothorax occurs when there is a defect located in the respiratory system, such as a puncture in the chest wall, resulting in contact between the pleural space and the outside atmosphere; closed pneumothorax, meanwhile, is identified as pneumothorax without any respiratory defects. Traumatic pneumothorax is generally open, while spontaneous pneumothorax is always closed. Another type of pneumothorax is tension pneumothorax, in which air is transferred into the pleural space during regular inhalation, becoming trapped, and creating a one-way transfer of air into the pleural space. Causes vary depending on the type of pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax may be due to a traumatic incident, such as a car accident, leading to penetrating injuries of the neck or chest. A surgical incision to the chest, or perforation of the esophagus during surgery may also lead to traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax, meanwhile, may be caused by a foreign body in the lung, lung cancer or abscess, lung disease caused by parasites, or the development of blister-like structures in the cat's lungs, known as pulmonary bullae. Two primary diagnostic procedures may be done in cases of suspected pneumothorax: thoracocentesis and bronchoscopy. Thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity, can confirm diagnosis, and can also be used to remove air from the pleural space. Bronchoscopy involves the use of a thin tube with a tiny camera attached to it, inserted into the airways by way of the mouth. This is best done if there is evidence of tracheal or large airway trauma. Additional diagnostic techniques may include X-ray imaging of the chest, and urine analysis. Cats with pneumothorax should be treated in the hospital until the accumulation of air in the pleural cavity has stopped or stabilized. As much air as possible should be removed from the pleural space, and oxygen therapy provided until your pet has stabilized. Air removal can be performed via thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity. In cases of traumatic open pneumothorax, the open wounds in the cat's chest should be cleaned and covered with an airtight bandage as soon as possible, and later surgically repaired. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids is also often necessary in cases of trauma. After initial treatment, the cat's activity should be severely restricted for at least one week to minimize the odds of recurrence. Vital signs, including respiratory rate and pulse, should be monitored for symptoms of recurrence. Further care depends on the type of pneumothorax affecting your cat and the severity of its health. Your veterinarian will advise you on how to provide aftercare to your cat until the follow-up exam. One key way to prevent traumatic pneumothorax is to keep cats confined and away from dangerous areas such as roads, where they are most likely to be injured. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/acral-lick-granulomas-cats,Acral Lick Granulomas in Cats,"Acral lick granulomas are skin lesions that appear more commonly in dogs but can occasionally be seen in cats, as well. This condition exists when your cat pet licks a specific area on its leg or paw. Allergies, anxiety, and other causes may be a trigger for this constant licking behavior. Cats will lick the area so much that its fur will be removed and the skin will become thick, red, and moist. Acral lick granulomas (sometimes called acral lick dermatitis) are usually about the size of a dime or nickel but can be larger. They are found most often on a cat’s lower legs or between its toes. If your cat has an acral lick granuloma, you may notice the following symptoms: Itchiness Excessive licking Hair loss Redness of the skin Thickened skin Scabbing Moist skin Odor (if secondary infection is present) Acral lick granulomas are caused by an underlying condition or problem, such as allergies , anxiety, joint pain, skin infection , mites , trauma, boredom, foreign material under the skin, or an insect bite. Regardless of the underlying cause, the constant licking behavior causes hair loss and the formation of a raised, ulcerated plaque on the skin that is referred to as a granuloma. It is classified as an acral lick granuloma because acral means legs and feet, which is where these lesions are found, and licking is the cause of the skin lesion. There are no cat breeds that are more prone to this skin condition than others. An acral lick granuloma is diagnosed based on medical history, a physical exam, and diagnostic tests. It is helpful for a veterinarian to know if a cat is constantly licking a specific area of its body and when the licking behavior started. It is also important to note any changes in the environment where the cat lives, such as diet, moving into a new house, or the addition of a new baby or pet to the household. After obtaining a thorough medical history, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam on your cat. The vet will look closely at your cat’s skin for fleas, other parasites, and signs of infection. The following diagnostic tests may be recommended to diagnose an acral lick granuloma and rule out other skin conditions: Tape impression : A piece of tape is gently placed over the skin lesion briefly and then removed. The tape is then stained and reviewed under the microscope to check for bacteria and yeast on the skin which would indicate a skin infection. Fungal culture : This test also checks for ringworm , which is a fungal infection that can cause a circular skin lesion where the fur is missing and the skin is inflamed. To perform a fungal culture, a veterinarian will pluck a sample of fur around the skin lesion and place it on a culture plate. Over 10 days, the culture plate will be examined daily to check for fungal growth. Fine needle aspirate and cytology : This test involves removing some cells from the skin lesion with a small needle to view under a microscope. Veterinarians recommend this test to determine if the skin lesion is due to a benign or cancerous mass. Skin biopsy : Occasionally a skin lesion needs to be biopsied to determine the cause of the lesion. This means obtaining a small section of skin that contains both healthy skin and the skin lesion. This is a minor surgical procedure that is performed with sedation. The biopsy sample is then sent to a pathologist for review. Skin scrapings : This test checks for skin mites, such as sarcoptic mange and demodex. The veterinarian will use a scalpel blade to gently scrape the skin. The material that is scraped off is examined under the microscope to look for the presence of skin mites. Skin culture : This test may be recommended to check for an antibiotic resistant skin infection. A sterile swab is rolled over the top of the skin lesion to obtain a sample of any bacteria that may be present. The swab is then placed in a culture medium to monitor bacterial growth over a three-day period. If bacteria growth is present, the type is identified and tested with a variety of antibiotics to determine which ones are best to treat the infection. Allergy testing : This test will determine if a cat has certain environmental allergies. Allergy testing usually involves a blood test, but intradermal testing (wheal and flare test) may also be recommended by a dermatologist to test for allergies to pollen, dust mites, mold, and insects in the environment. Food trial : A cat may need to go through a food trial to determine if a food allergy is the cause of its skin condition. A food trial takes approximately six-to-eight weeks and involves feeding a very strict limited ingredient diet consisting of prescription food that contains either novel protein or hydrolyzed protein. During this trial, it is crucial to not feed your pet any other cat food, cat treats (other than hypoallergenic), or people food. Only feed prescribed food and treats approved by your veterinarian. Treatment of an acral lick granuloma involves the following: Prevent licking : It is crucial that the cat stops licking at the acral lick granuloma. If licking continues, this skin lesion will never resolve. The best way to prevent licking is for the cat to wear an e-collar (cone) until the acral lick granuloma is gone. You can also try Yuck! No Chew Spray , a topical product that can be sprayed on the skin lesion. The bitter taste of this product is meant to discourage licking of the area. However, some cats will continue to lick the area even with the Yuck spray applied. The use of an e-collar is the most effective method of stopping a cat from licking a skin lesion. Treat any secondary infection : If there is a bacterial or yeast infection on the surface of the granuloma secondary to licking, then this infection must be treated with oral and/or topical medication prescribed by a veterinarian. Cold laser therapy : This therapy can be performed two-to-three times weekly by a veterinarian or veterinary assistant to reduce inflammation (swelling) at the site of the acral lick granuloma. Address underlying cause for acral lick granuloma : There are many possible causes for acral lick granulomas, and if the cause can be identified and treated, this will help the skin lesion resolve and hopefully prevent recurrence. Treatment will vary based on the underlying cause. For instance, if boredom or anxiety are the cause for the formation of an acral lick granuloma, then behavioral modification is needed, which may involve more human interaction, toys, exercise, medication, or removing environmental stressors (if possible). If arthritis is found to be the underlying cause of an acral lick granuloma, a veterinarian may recommend a weight loss plan, joint supplement, or medication to address the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. Acral lick granulomas can take weeks or months to resolve. Healing will be delayed if a cat licks at the acral lick granuloma. It is crucial to prevent licking, treat any secondary infection, and address the underlying cause for the granuloma, if found. During recovery, it is important to watch the acral lick granuloma to make sure that the skin lesion is improving daily. If it increases in size, becomes increasingly red or swollen (or has an odor), then these symptoms need to be reported to your veterinarian. Applying a bandage over the granuloma is not recommended as this will trap moisture close to the skin and cause the acral lick granuloma to become even more inflamed and possibly infected. If you notice that your cat is licking an area excessively, place an e-collar (cone) that has been properly fitted over your cat’s head to prevent licking and check the area where your cat is licking to see if there is a wound, crusts, hair loss, redness, swelling, or odor. Schedule an appointment with your local veterinarian as soon as possible so your pet can be examined. It is best to schedule an appointment for your cat within a few days of noticing the excessive licking instead of waiting weeks.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/acute-liver-failure-cats-signs-and-treatment,Acute Liver Failure in Cats: Signs and Treatment,"FreshSplash/E+ via Getty Images Liver failure in cats is a significant and life-threatening medical condition, especially if left untreated. This article explores its symptoms, causes, and treatment options so you are better prepared to care for your cat. Acute liver failure in cats occurs when there suddenly isn’t enough liver tissue for the organ to carry out its normal and essential functions. The liver absorbs and makes multiple proteins and clotting factors, neutralizes and gets rid of wastes and toxins, controls glucose (sugar) levels, and aids in daily digestion and metabolism processes. Because of its functions, the liver is at high risk for damage from a variety of sources, but fortunately, it has the unique ability to regrow after it’s damaged. Studies have shown that liver failure happens when more than 70% of the liver is damaged. Acute is a vague term, but usually, symptoms are shown within a few days of initial damage. As a result, acute liver failure is often harder to reverse and results in a higher death rate. Some causes of liver failure can be cured if found and treated early enough. Acute liver failure in cats is considered a medical emergency and is a painful and exhausting condition that can result in death. Cats with end-stage liver failure (cirrhosis) often die within days of diagnosis. For cats that recover, long-term liver damage can occur, leading to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis. Symptoms of acute liver disease in cats are often vague and can take time to be noticeable. Many pets with this condition have: Abdominal pain Decreased appetite Increased thirst and urination Vomiting and diarrhea , with or without blood Weakness Weight loss As the disease progresses and greater liver damage happens, symptoms will become more severe, such as: Bleeding from the nose , mouth, rectum, and bladder Collapse Icterus (yellowing of the skin, gums, and eyes) Melena (black tarry stools) Neurologic and behavioral changes such as: head pressing , seizures , circling, lack of coordination, hyperactivity, excessive salivation , blindness , or coma Petechiae and ecchymoses ( bruising noted on the skin, gums, and eyes) Swelling of the belly (ascites) and limbs (edema) In cats with acute liver failure, sometimes the underlying cause may be unknown (termed idiopathic), but there are several known causes of liver failure, such as: Abscess , which results from umbilical cord infections in kittens but can also occur in adult cats from bacteria such as Yersinia pestis and Actinomyces spp. Cancer like lymphoma Cholangiohepatitis or triaditis, inflammatory disease often affecting the gallbladder , pancreas, and liver at the same time Heart failure and clots Heavy metals like copper, although rare in cats Hepatic lipidosis , which is the most common and potentially reversible cause of acute liver failure Infectious organisms: Clostridium (bacterial), histoplasmosis (fungal), liver flukes (parasitic), toxoplasmosis (protozoal), feline infectious peritonitis and FeLV / FIV (viral) Inherited conditions such as amyloidosis —seen in breeds like Abyssinians , Siamese , and other Oriental cats—and biliary cystic disease, more common in Persians Medications such as diazepam and Tylenol (acetaminophen) Portosystemic shunts, usually a congenital issue (present at birth) Toxins such as blue-green algae , mycotoxins (aflatoxin, usually through eating moldy or spoiled food), rodenticides , pine oil Cats can get acute liver failure from many causes. Because the symptoms are often vague, diagnosing acute liver failure can be difficult. Veterinarians rely on tools such as blood work and urinalysis in addition to a physical exam to diagnose acute liver failure in cats. After these basic tests, your veterinarian may need to perform additional tests to check liver function and severity of liver damage. For a more accurate diagnosis, a liver sample is needed, which can be taken either through surgery or biopsy , where a needle is put directly into the liver. Because cats with acute liver failure are very sick, hospitalization of several days is often needed. The goal of treatment for acute liver failure in cats is to slow the disease progression and allow time for the liver to regrow. Therapy for the underlying cause, if that cause is known, is ultimately needed along with early and aggressive symptomatic treatment, including the following: Antacids, antinausea medications ( Cerenia , famotidine , ranitidine ), and gastroprotectants like sucralfate N-acetylcysteine SAMe and milk thistle derivatives (silymarin) along with ursodiol Pain control Flumazenil for suspected cases of diazepam intoxication. Vitamin K1 to aid with clotting For known or suspected cases of eating or drinking a toxin, talking with Pet Poison Hotline (855-764-7661) is advised. Consultation fees may apply. Dietary therapy can also help with liver function and slow further damage to the liver. Prescription diets such as Hill's I/D , Royal Canin hepatic, or Purina HP Hepatic have more digestible protein, more antioxidants that help protect cells from damage, and, to help with fluid levels, lower amounts of sodium. For some cats, especially those with hepatic lipidosis, feeding tubes are needed to deliver nutrients. Be sure to discuss the kind of diet, if applicable, with your veterinarian. As some cats with acute liver failure may have neurologic signs, daily nursing care—such as frequent turning them over onto their other side, soft bedding to prevent decubital ulcers, and keeping them dry and clean—is important. Enemas, lactulose, and antibiotics like neomycin or metronidazole may be needed in these cats as well. In cases of end-stage liver failure, after managing complications and keeping quality of life for as long as possible, unfortunately, humane euthanasia may be necessary. If the underlying cause is treated early and aggressively enough, some cats can recover and have a good quality of life. This is largely due to the liver's ability to regenerate. Finding the issue early and having routine veterinary check-ups can go a long way to ensuring a positive outcome. Not all causes of liver failure can be prevented, but there are some ways to decrease your cat’s risks. You can: Keep garbage and medications away from your cat’s reach. Block access to medications and toxins , like rodenticide . Keep your cat vaccinated and routinely dewormed . Take steps to avoid sources of possible bacterial contamination by keeping your cat indoors. Have your cat examined right away if she stops eating . Talk to your veterinarian about the risks and benefits of certain medications for your cat. Fortunately, the liver has a large reserve capacity and there are many conditions it can recover from. Treatment of acute liver failure in cats is largely symptomatic and supportive care (e.g., fluid therapy, antibiotics, antioxidants, gastroprotectants) to relieve pain and discomfort while giving the liver time to recover. Ultimately, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause, if found. Cats with end-stage liver failure are truly sick. They will have yellowing of the skin and gums, and they often have pinpoint hemorrhages (petechiae) throughout their body and swollen limbs and belly; will act depressed or lethargic; or are in a coma. Cats with liver failure have different outlooks depending on the underlying cause. With prompt treatment, acute liver failure can be managed, giving the liver time to recover and for those cats to go on with a normal life. Other diseases, like cancer, or complications that can arise from acute liver failure can result in a poor quality of life and short lifespan. Cullen JM.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_acute_respiratory_distress,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) involves severe inflammation of the lungs which ultimately leads to acute respiratory failure and death in affected cats. This is a life-threatening problem, causing death in a majority of patients despite life saving efforts and treatment. An almost 100 percent death rate is reported in affected cats due to ARDS. Genetic factors have been found to play a role in the development of acute respiratory failure in people, but these factors have not yet been investigated in cats. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can present with a number of conditions and symptoms, which vary depending upon the underlying cause. Following are general symptoms seen in ARDS: Following are some of the major causes of ARDS in cats: Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a life threatening emergency that requires immediate treatment for any chance of recovery. Along with emergency treatment, your veterinarian will try to find the underlying cause of the disorder. Various laboratory test panels will be ordered, including blood tests, serum biochemical tests, urine tests and blood gases. Blood gas analysis is one of the most important diagnostic methods used in veterinary practice for ARDS. Your veterinarian will also order chest X-rays and an echocardiography to evaluate the lungs and heart. Despite recent advances, ARDS remains one of the most difficult and challenging problems to treat in veterinary practice. Once your cat has been diagnosed with this syndrome it will be given emergency treatment; supplemental oxygen therapy is started immediately to minimize the respiratory distress. Patients that do not respond well to the oxygen therapy, and that continue to have severe breathing problems, may need ventilator support. For this reason, your cat will most likely need to be kept in an intensive care unit, where nursing staff can monitor the condition very closely until your cat is out of the danger zone and its condition has stabilized. Regular readings of temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure will be taken by nursing staff. Along with emergency treatment, the underlying cause muse be established and treated in order to prevent further complications. Medications that may be used to treat your cat include antibiotics, pain killers, fluid therapy, and corticosteroids. Patients on ventilator support may also require regular physiotherapy sessions and frequent position changes to prevent complications related to ventilator support. These patients are kept in strict cage confinement until they have fully recovered. ARDS is a very serious problem requiring constant support from your side for treatment, and for management and care after the initial period of discovery. If the underlying disease is not resolved, the same episode of respiratory distress may follow. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for proper care and treatment. These patients usually need time, rest, and good nutrition in order to gain full recovery, but don’t confine your cat to a stuffy or hot place. Follow the diet and management recommendations made by your veterinarian. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/addisons-disease-cats,Addison’s Disease in Cats,"Addison’s disease (also called hypoadrenocorticism) affects the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as cortisol that are vital to the healthy function of many of the body’s systems. A lack of these hormones can have devastating effects on a cat’s health. In cats, the adrenal glands are found in front of the kidneys, and the hormones produced help control: Electrolytes : Aldosterone is one of the hormones involved with balancing electrolytes, which affect hydration. Glucocorticoids (such as cortisol) : These hormones affect numerous functions such as the immune system, regulating glucose, fat, and protein metabolism. Sexual function : The adrenals are responsible for producing sex hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, and androgens. Addison’s disease is very rare in cats. Although rare, Addison’s should be considered a medical emergency because the disease impacts so many vital systems. Symptoms are sporadic and can often include vomiting or gastrointestinal upset that may be brought on or worsened by stress or another illness. Most cats experience some of the following symptoms: Decreased appetite and/or weight loss Malaise and weakness Dehydration , with increased thirst and urination Slow capillary refill time, in which a veterinarian presses on gums and counts the seconds until the area refills with blood Low blood pressure and/or heart rate Vomiting Hypothermia Diarrhea may also occur, though not as frequently as other symptoms. Other signs include those related to shock, such as cooler than normal limbs or paws; pale or discolored gums; shallow or rapid breathing; or rapid or absent pulses. Addison’s disease, while rare, does not seem to be associated with any breed or particular age. Although the cause is unknown, it may be due to an autoimmune condition in which a cat’s immune system attacks and destroys the adrenal glands. In addition, Addison’s has been associated with lymphoma or the sudden withdrawal of steroid therapy. Addison’s disease is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests and a history of symptoms associated with the disease. Blood tests, such as a complete blood cell count (CBC), check for: Anemia (low red blood cell count) Changes in a cat’s white blood cell pattern Increase in eosinophils, a type of white blood cell Other tests will look for an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and phosphorus. A vet will look for electrolyte imbalance (such as high potassium or low sodium, which can affect the heart’s rhythm). If a vet suspects Addison’s, a test called ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) will be ordered. This test evaluates adrenal function and mimics what is naturally (or should be) occurring in the cat. ACTH hormone is produced by the pituitary gland, which acts on the adrenals to produce the hormone cortisol. In the hospital, a blood sample is taken from the cat to measure the baseline cortisol. Then a synthetic ACTH is administered, and another blood sample is taken from the cat an hour later and compared with the first. In cases of Addison’s, there will be minimal to no increase of cortisol. Additional tests that may be recommended include: Urinalysis to look for evidence of kidney disease and concentration of the urine Blood pressure to diagnose hypotension and response to IV fluid therapy Chest X-rays to look for heart issues (microcardia) ECG to determine the presence of arrhythmias and evidence of electrolyte issues Although there is no cure, Addison’s disease is manageable and cats can enjoy long, active and happy lives. If symptoms are severe, initial treatment will focus on stabilizing the cat. Dehydration, hypovolemia, anemia, vomiting, or electrolyte derangements often require aggressive fluid therapy, and possibly blood transfusions. If required, various medications will be given. Several days of hospitalization may be needed. Addison’s disease occurs due to a lack of steroids, so the treatment of choice is steroid replacement therapy, often with prednisolone or depo-medrol. This can be given as a pill, liquid, or monthly injection. Therapy may be coupled with a synthetic mineralocorticoid (desoxycorticosterone pivalate, or DOCP), an injectable given about once every month, or fludrocortisone acetate , an oral medication given daily, are the treatments of choice. Once your cat is discharged, your veterinarian may recommend a follow-up exam with bloodwork in a few weeks after starting these medications. The dose and frequency of both medications will be influenced by the results, and it may take several follow-up visits before the dose is correct and working properly. Once stable and well-managed, your cat may still need to have her electrolytes checked prior to every DOCP injection and they should continue to be examined frequently, about once every 3 to 6 months, or as directed by your veterinarian. Dosing can change over time due to the disease. Many of the symptoms initially experienced take several days to resolve and if initial treatment is successful, the long-term prognosis is good. Be sure to adhere to your veterinarian’s recheck and follow-up guidelines and remember that your cat requires lifelong medication! And because cortisol is needed to adapt to stressful situations, in Addisonian cats, even small stressors could have serious consequences. It’s recommended that during periods of increased stress and illness you speak with your veterinarian about the need to increase the dose of your cat’s medication. Addison’s disease cannot be prevented, but understanding the condition can ensure your cat receives prompt veterinary attention, which in turn can increase the likelihood of a more favorable outcome. With proper management and follow-up, the long-term prognosis is good, except for cats in which the underlying cause is due to cancer. An Addisonian crisis is a life-threatening medical emergency characterized by hypovolemic shock (due to loss of bodily fluid), low blood pressure, and electrolyte issues, and the cat is often unable to rise. It is treated with aggressive fluid therapy, steroids, dextrose (sugar replacement), and other medications designed to restore normal body functions and reverse the effects of shock.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_iris_bombe_and_adhesion_of_iris_in_eye,Adhesions of the Eye’s Iris and Swelling of Eye in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye, either the cornea or lens. Iris bombe occurs when there is a complete adhesion between the cat’s iris and the capsule of the lens of the eye, creating a 360 degree area of adhesion. This degree of adhesion results in a billowing of the iris forward into the eye. Symptoms seen with iris bombe include: Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball). In many cases, treatment may not be necessary. However, when glaucoma occurs in conjunction with iris bombe and synechiae, it must be treated. In cases like this, laser surgery may be necessary to release the adhesions from the iris.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_pheochromocytoma,Adrenal Gland Cancer (Pheochromocytoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A pheochromocytoma is a type of adrenal gland tumor which causes the gland to make too much of some of the hormones. This can cause an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. These symptoms are intermittent (not present all of the time) because the hormones that cause them are not made all of the time or are made in low amounts. Pheochromocytomas are rare in cats. When they do occur it is usually with older cats. Because this tumor affects an endocrine gland that functions to spread hormones, pheochromocytomas commonly spread to organs that are near them and can rapidly metastasize to other areas of the body. Pheochromocytoma is labeled idiopathic, since there is no known cause for this condition. Your veterinarian will need a thorough medical history and time-line of your cat's behavior, health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will palpate your cat's belly to see if a mass can be felt or if there is extra fluid is present. A rapid heart rate (tachycardia) is sometimes found during the physical examination, but sometimes, there will not be anything that appears to be abnormal during the examination. Standard blood work, including a complete blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis will be ordered. These will indicate how well your cat's internal organs are working and whether there are any infections present. Your veterinarian may also order a special blood test which will indicate whether the adrenal gland is functioning normally. Your cat's blood pressure will be taken, and in some cases, the blood pressure will be very high, indicating hypertension. If your cat's heart rate is very high, or its heart seems to have an abnormal rhythm, your veterinarian may order an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical capability of the heart. Your veterinarian will also order x-rays and/or ultrasound images of your cat's abdomen and thorax (chest). If there are abnormalities of the internal organs, they may show up on an x-ray or ultrasound image. Further diagnostic tests may include a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance image (MRI). These imaging tools are higher sensitivity tests, which can give a more detailed picture of your cat's internal organs. To confirm a final diagnosis, your veterinarian will need to take a biopsy of the adrenal gland for laboratory analysis. It is common for cats with a pheochromocytoma to have more than one medical problem, and treatment will be approached according to which condition is most critical. Surgery is the chosen treatment for a pheochromocytoma. If your cat has high blood pressure or a very high heart rate, these conditions will be treated with medication and stabilized before surgery can be performed. If the blood pressure or heart rate are dangerously high, your cat may need to be in intensive care before surgery can be performed. Some cats need to be placed on medication to control blood pressure and heart rate for several weeks before surgery can be performed. During surgery, the affected adrenal gland will be removed. Because the adrenal gland is near some very large blood vessels, surgery can be challenging. If, during surgery, it is found that other organs are being affected by the tumor, they will need to be removed as well, either in part or in their entirety, depending on the organ. After surgery, your cat will be kept in the hospital intensive care unit until it is stable. Problems during and after surgery are common. Your veterinarian will monitor for bleeding, high or low blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythm, difficulty breathing, or post-operative infections. Unfortunately, some cats do not make it through recovery because of these problems, especially if they have other medical problems. Your veterinarian will help you to decide the best course of action based on the diagnosis and expectations for recovery. Once your cat's tumor has been removed and it is able to return home with you, it will take a little time for your cat to return to a normal life with normal activity. Your cat's life expectancy will be based on whether there are other health conditions concurrent with the pheochromocytoma. Some cats will continue to live for three or more years, while others have shorter expectancies. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/poisoning-toxicity/c_ct_glow_jewelry_poisoning_in_cats,Adverse Reaction in Cats to Glow Jewelry,"PetMD Editorial Glow jewelry, which is available in the form of glow sticks, glow bracelets, glow necklaces and more, contain a chemical that glows in the dark and are particularly popular around the July 4 holiday and Halloween. However, when chewed or ingested by your cat, the chemical inside of the sticks and/or jewelry cause an intense reaction to the taste of the chemical. This adverse reaction associated with glow jewelry can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs , please visit this page in the petMD health library. When cats bite into or ingest glow jewelry or glow sticks, the chemical dibutyl phthalate causes an intense taste reaction. Symptoms seen include: Other than the reaction to the bad taste, glow sticks and glow jewelry are generally not toxic. It is the chemical found in glow sticks and other glow jewelry named dibutyl phthalate which may cause adverse reactions in cats and that cats find offensive. In addition to taking the cat's medical history, a veterinarian will observe your cat for signs and symptoms associated with ingesting dibutyl phthalate. Generally, no treatment is needed for cats that ingest glow jewelry. However, providing water or food to diminish the taste of the glow stick/jewelry can be useful in alleviating symptoms. Washing the chemical off of your cat’s fur and skin with shampoo and water is also recommended. Taking your pet into a darkened room can help you locate the chemical on your cat’s fur and skin to aid in removal. The best way to prevent accidental ingestion is to keep glow sticks and glow jewelry out of your cat's reach. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/alopecia-cats-what-it-and-why-your-cat-losing-hair,Alopecia in Cats: What It Is and Why Your Cat Is Losing Hair,"Mayur Kakade/E+ via Getty Images Alopecia in cats refers to hair loss. This condition isn’t considered a medical emergency, but if you notice your cat losing hair, it’s a good idea to see a veterinarian within a few days to determine the cause, so appropriate treatment can begin. When cats experience alopecia, they lose thick tufts of fur in various locations throughout their bodies, leaving exposed skin. Cats may develop alopecia due to genetics, underlying health conditions, or stress and anxiety . Symptoms of alopecia in cats include the following: Hair loss Itchiness Flaky skin Red skin Skin bumps Excessive licking or chewing of fur There are several causes for alopecia in cats, which may include: Genetics Stress Anxiety Diabetes mellitus Cushing’s disease Hyperthyroidism Food allergy Environmental allergies Skin infection External parasites, such as fleas or mites Autoimmune diseases, such as sebaceous adenitis Medication allergy Pain Ringworm Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) Feline leukemia suppresses a cat's immune system. In turn, cats have trouble absorbing important nutrients to maintain a healthy coat. Similarly, with a weakened immune system, cats have an increased risk for skin infections that can lead to hair loss. Although cats of all breeds, sexes, and ages can be affected by alopecia, Abyssinians , Siamese , and black cats have an increased risk. To diagnose alopecia in cats, a vet will examine the pet to check for obvious abnormalities, such as hair loss or itchiness. A flea comb will be used to see if fleas or flea dirt are present in the cat’s fur . A veterinarian can diagnose alopecia simply by doing this complete physical exam . Pet parents should let their veterinarian know if their cats are taking any new medications, showing any concerning symptoms, and how long the hair loss has been present. To determine the underlying cause for the alopecia, a veterinarian may perform the following tests: Blood work: The veterinary technician collects a small sample of your cat’s blood to look for signs of underlying disease, such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism. Urinalysis: A sample of urine is analyzed for abnormalities, such as bacteria, glucose, or cortisol. Diet trial: If a food allergy is suspected, a special prescription diet may be recommended for eight to 12 weeks to see if symptoms resolve. This is followed by a reintroduction of the old diet to see if symptoms flare up. Intradermal skin testing: If environmental allergies are suspected, a veterinary dermatologist can shave a patch of fur and insert a variety of potential allergens just underneath the skin to note a reaction. Skin scrape: A dull blade is used to gently scrape the affected area of skin for a sample. The sample is then added to a glass slide and viewed under the microscope for signs of mites. Acetate tape prep: A piece of clear tape is gently pressed onto the area of hair loss, stained, and viewed under the microscope to check for bacteria and yeast. Wood’s lamp: If ringworm is suspected, a special light can be used to shine on the affected area in the dark. If ringworm is present, the fur will glow bright green. Alopecia in cats is treated according to the underlying cause. Several treatment options include the following: Calming supplements , such as Purina Pro Plan Calming Care Pheromones, such as Feliway Antiparasitic medications, such as Bravecto Antifungal medicine, such as Itrafungol Pain medication, such as robenacoxib Antibiotics, such as Clavamox Allergy medicine, such as cyclosporine Diet change Methimazole (for hyperthyroid cats) Alopecia is curable in many situations, but fur can take months to fully regrow. In some instances—such as with chronic endocrine diseases—alopecia may need to be managed long-term and may never fully resolve. Cats who have experienced hair loss may need two months or more for fur to regrow after treating the underlying cause. Cats can recover from alopecia once the underlying cause has been successfully treated. For example, if the alopecia was caused by fleas, a topical preventive can be applied, and hair will generally start to regrow in one to two months. However, if the cat has a chronic health condition like diabetes, alopecia can be frequent and recurrent due to fluctuating blood sugar levels. To prevent alopecia in cats, pet parents should ensure their cats receive regular veterinary care to identify any health concerns early. Keeping cats on year-round flea-and-tick products can prevent parasites that can cause alopecia. Providing a quiet, safe space for your cat to rest , and a predictable routine without added stressors can reduce anxiety that may lead to hair loss. Treatment for alopecia depends on the underlying cause. For example, fleas are one of the most common reasons for hair loss, which would be treated with a topical flea preventive. Alopecia is not harmful for cats, but it can be uncomfortable for them due to the hair loss and patchy fur. It can also lead to skin dryness and itching. Helping your cat regrow hair should focus on treating the underlying cause with the help of a veterinarian. Providing a quiet, stress-free environment can also encourage hair regrowth.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_feline_amebiasis,Ameba Infection in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Amebiasis, a parasitic infection caused by a one celled organism known as an ameba, can affect people as well as dogs and cats. It is found most often in tropical areas and can be seen in North America. Entamoeba histolytica is the species of ameba which has the ability to infect cats. Infection results in colitis causing severe intractable diarrhea. Blood in stool may also be associated with amebiasis. Entamoeba histolyticus is most often spread through the ingestion of infected human feces. Young cats and those that are immunosuppressed are the most likely to become ill. Blood testing (complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) and urine testing (urinatlysis) are usually performed and are often normal although evidence of dehydration, if present, can be seen in these tests. Other laboratory tests your veterinarian may recommend include: Metronidazole is used to control the symptoms of colitis and is usually successful. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/poisoning-toxicity/c_ct_amitraz_poisoning,Amitraz Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Amitraz is a chemical that is used as a tick preventive in many formulations, including tick collars, topical preparation and dips. It is also used to treat parasitic infections such as mange. Amitraz poisoning is rarer in cats than in dogs. When seen, it usually results from the improper use of a dog product on a cat. Amitraz toxicity is caused by ingestion of or exposure to products containing amitraz. Amitraz toxicity may occur in cats when dog products containing amitraz are used on the cat or when the cat contacts a dog with amitraz still present on the skin and/or hair coat. The pet’s history may reveal exposure to a product containing amitraz. Blood testing (complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) may be normal but hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) is a common finding. Less commonly, elevations of the liver enzymes may be seen also. If amitraz is present on the skin and hair coat, the cat should be washed with a dish-washing detergent or other shampoo to remove the residue, then rinsed thoroughly with warm water. Supportive therapy such as intravenous fluids, maintenance of body temperature and nutritional support may be necessary. The cat should be closely monitored. If a collar or part of a collar has been ingested, it should be removed with the use of an endoscope (a long slender tube that is inserted into the intestinal tract). Hydrogen peroxide may be used to induce vomiting and clean any remaining amitraz out of the stomach. Activated charcoal is often used to help prevent further absorption of the amitraz from the stomach and intestinal tract as well. Other drugs that are sometimes used include yohimbine and atipamezole. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/poisoning-toxicity/c_ct_amphetamine_poisoning_in_cats,Amphetamine Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A prescription medication, amphetamines are used to treat ADD/ADHD and narcolepsy in humans. They are used for weight loss as well. They can also be obtained illicitly (crystal meth, methamphetamine, ecstacy). When ingested by your cat, however, amphetamines can be very toxic. Amphetamine toxicity can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Possible symptoms of amphetamine poisoning in cats include: Most cases of amphetamine poisoning in cats are accidental, caused by the cat ingesting pills that are dropped on the floor. Cats may also find and ingest medication from pill bottles left on countertops and in other accessible areas. Occasionally, the drug may be given to the cat purposely. After asking you questions regarding the cat's medical history, your veterinarian will observe the animal for clinical signs consistent with amphetamine ingestion. Blood, urine or stomach contents can be tested for the presence of amphetamines, but it generally takes several days for results to be obtained. Therefore, treatment for amphetamine poisoning must be initiated before these results are returned. Consult your veterinarian for instructions. Activated charcoal may be used to adsorb the poison in the stomach. Gastric lavage (“pumping the stomach”) may be necessary as well. Intravenous fluid therapy may be necessary to dilute the toxicity. Your veterinarian may also administer sedatives and/or anticonvulsants to control seizures and reduce stimulation of the nervous system. Cooling measures may be necessary if the cat’s body temperature rises to dangerous levels. Finally, your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat’s blood chemistry results. Kidney function tests must be closely monitored in cats poisoned with amphetamines. Additionally, blood pressure and body temperature must be monitored. Once returned home, a cat that has suffered from amphetamine poisoning must be kept in a calm quiet atmosphere to facilitate recovery. In order to prevent accidental amphetamine poisoning, keep all prescription medications secured in a location inaccessible to your cat. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/systemic/amyloidosis-cats,Amyloidosis in Cats,"Amyloidosis in cats is a condition in which a protein called amyloid is deposited in various tissues and organs throughout the body. This buildup of proteins can lead to organ dysfunction and illness in your cat. Although this condition is uncommon in most cats, it does occur more often in certain breeds, including: Abyssinians Siamese Burmese Tonkinese Devon Rex Oriental Shorthairs Amyloid can be deposited throughout the body, or it can be localized in a specific area or organ system. This abnormally folded protein inserts itself into these areas, displacing normal cells. Amyloidosis can be deadly if enough of the protein is deposited into important organs, such as the kidneys, liver, or heart. This condition can develop in cats of any age, but it predominantly affects cats who are 7 years old or older. Another form of amyloidosis, known as senile systemic amyloidosis, occurs in older cats and is often characterized by small deposits that have little to no effect on a cat’s health. This form is often seen as an incidental finding during a necropsy on cats who have died from other conditions. Signs of amyloidosis in cats vary depending on the area(s) of the body affected. The most common organs involved in amyloidosis in cats are the kidneys, which can cause: Lethargy Changes in appetite Increased thirst and increased urination Weight loss Dull hair coat Depression and weakness Vomiting Diarrhea Dehydration Fluid accumulation under the skin, in the abdomen, and/or in the chest Severe kidney disease, resulting in: Mouth ulcers Development of blood clots (which can lead to breathing difficulties, weakness, and an inability to use the hind legs) Cats with amyloidosis of the liver may also exhibit yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) and internal bleeding, which can be evident as a distended abdomen, pale gums, rapid breathing, or collapse. The exact cause of amyloidosis in cats is unknown. Some cat breeds are genetically predisposed to amyloidosis, such as Abyssinians, who have an abnormal gene that causes excessive amyloid to be produced. Amyloidosis can also be caused by an infection, cancer , or other immune-mediated or inflammatory conditions. There are different types of amyloid proteins, including: AA amyloid is often a result of a long-term inflammatory condition, a chronic bacterial infection, or cancer. AA amyloid often deposits in organs such as the spleen or kidneys, leading to kidney failure. While this type of genetic renal (kidney) amyloidosis is not common in cats in general, it’s often seen in Abyssinian cats. AL amyloid is another form of protein deposit and is often linked with cancer. This type affects the joints or nerve tissue, such as plasma cell tumors or myelomas. If your cat is not feeling well , your vet will run a variety of diagnostic tests depending on what they suspect the underlying cause to be. Urine testing and blood work, including a complete blood count (CBC) and a biochemistry panel, will help determine if there is any organ dysfunction. Your veterinarian will likely recommend an abdominal ultrasound, which can look at the architecture of the organs to determine if there is an abnormality in their structure. This ultrasound can also help your vet in performing biopsies of anything abnormal within the belly. Amyloidosis is difficult to diagnose. If your cat has chronic kidney or liver failure or other forms of chronic infection or inflammation, your vet might suspect amyloidosis. Once a cat starts to show clinical signs of amyloidosis, the disease is often already in its later stages and can be fatal. Thus, most cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed through necropsy. A biopsy of affected organs will show amyloid protein deposits, which is the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. A biopsy can be performed both before and after death. There is no specific treatment for amyloidosis to remove the protein deposits or stop them from accumulating. Rather, treatment is aimed at decreasing the production of any more amyloid by controlling the underlying condition and treating the clinical signs. Any underlying medical condition such as cancer, infection, or inflammation should be treated if possible. If your cat has kidney or liver failure, hospitalization with IV fluids for at least 72 hours is recommended for diuresis (increasing urine production). Antibiotics might also be given if there is evidence of a urinary tract infection or kidney infection. Also, kidney disease caused by amyloidosis can cause high blood pressure , which needs to be treated as well. Once your cat is stabilized with medical intervention by your veterinarian, outpatient management will focus on keeping the cat’s organs as healthy as possible. With kidney disease, a special low-protein diet is helpful, along with any necessary medications to correct electrolyte abnormalities and promote kidney health. Cats with liver disease are often maintained on a special diet and antioxidant medications. Amyloidosis is a potentially fatal disease. If the kidneys are involved, most cats survive less than a year. Cats who are less affected may not develop kidney failure for some time, if at all, and therefore may have a normal life expectancy . Most cats affected by amyloidosis are at least 7 years old, but it can occur at any age. In genetically linked amyloidosis in Abyssinian and Siamese cats, the average age of onset is much younger: less than 5 years of age and as early as 1 year old. There is currently no genetic test for this condition. Although rare in general, Abyssinian and Siamese cats commonly develop kidney amyloidosis. Oriental Shorthairs, Siamese, and Devon Rex cats are predisposed to liver amyloidosis. Featured Image: iStock/Dariia Chernenko Tizard, I. Amyloidosis in Cats . Merck Veterinary Manual . October 2022.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_anaerobic_infections,Anaerobic Bacterial Infections in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Anaerobes are a normal part of the body's chemical community, living in symbiosis in the cat's abdomen, vaginal canal, intestines and mouth. However, when something happens to disrupt the balance of bacteria, such as what occurs with deep injuries, surgery or internal infections, these bacteria can invade the tissue, leading to deep infection and tissue death. If left untreated, an anaerobic infection can lead to shock and even death. The bacteria which cause anaerobic infections are able to grow best in the absence of free oxygen. Consequently, these bacteria often thrive in the mouth around the gums; in deep wounds, such as those caused by puncture to the skin; in wounds caused by fractured bone, where the bone has broken through to the surface; and in deep bite wounds. Depending on the cause of the anaerobic infection, cats may display a variety of symptoms. Cats that have developed an anaerobic bacterial infection because of a wound, for instance, may display bite marks, have pus oozing from the wound, or open fractures (where bone sticks out). Moreover, wounds infected with anaerobic bacteria will be slow to heal. Other common symptoms of anaerobic bacterial infections in cats include fever, lameness, difficulty eating, and loss of appetite (related to infection of the gums). There are also several types of bacteria that can lead to infections, including: The ultimate cause of an anaerobic bacterial infection is the disruption of normal bacterial balance within the cat's body. This can be due to deep injury, trauma, or recent surgical procedures (such as abdominal surgery or when metal implants are placed within the body to support broken bones). You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition, such as injuries, even slight injuries, fights your cat might have had with another animal, problems eating (which may be related to a mouth infection), and any recent surgeries. Your doctor will need to rule out other causes before making a confirmation of anaerobic infection. Standard tests include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, any of which may show a higher than normal white blood cell count, or evidence of a systemic infection. Your veterinarian will be taking samples of any pus along with the tissue (skin/muscle) around the wound to be laboratory cultured (grown) without oxygen. If there is growth, this may be taken as a confirmation that anaerobic bacteria are present. Your veterinarian will put your cat on long-term antibiotics. While it can be frustrating to give your cat pills for weeks, it is essential to do so for the entire course, even after the symptoms have passed and your cat appears to be better. If even a small amount of the infection remains, it can return worse than before. For especially reluctant cats, many of them will eat pills that have been hidden in a small amount of food that your cat does not normally receive, such as a piece of fresh fish or chicken meat (cooked). If you use this method to give antibiotics to your pet, always be sure that the cat has eaten and swallowed the entire bite of food and that it is not spitting it out in a hidden place (behind a couch, etc.). Specific treatment will be dependent on whether the infection is in an easily reachable location. If the infection is in the muscles (of the legs, back, rump, neck, etc.) the veterinarian will open the wound, clean out the dead tissue and expose the tissue to oxygen. If the anaerobic infection is within the body, such as an infected uterus, inside the bones, or in the abdomen, then the veterinarian will have to anesthetize the cat to surgically open and clean and/or drain the wounds. These infections are often long-lasting and require long-term antibiotics and monitoring by a veterinarian. It is important to give the antibiotics to your cat on time and as your veterinarian has instructed. If there is bandaging, have your veterinarian go over cleaning and redressing procedures, to ensure that the wound is able to heal. You may need to use am Elizabethan collar, or cone, to keep your cat from getting to the wound. Be sure to take your cat back for regular follow-up appointments so that wounds may be reopened and cleansed if necessary. Biochemical profiles will also be repeated at follow-up veterinary visits to check on the status of the infection. In-between visits, you should call your veterinarian if you notice any changes in your cat's behavior. If the cat seems very tired, has no appetite, or has any redness, swelling or pus at the site of the wound, for example, be sure to consult your veterinarian immediately. During the healing process, you may need to limit or prevent your cat's outdoor time, to prevent the infected site from getting dirty, and keep the litter box cleaner than usual (i.e., cleaning after each use) to prevent additional bacteria from entering the wound.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_adenocarcinoma_anal,Anal Gland Cancer in Cats,"All cats have two anal sacs located between the muscles on each side of the anal sphincter, just past the anal opening/anus. These anal sacs are lined with glands that produce debris, which normally comes out from a small opening on either side of the anus when the cat has a bowel movement. Anal gland cancer in cats, referred to as anal sac adenocarcinoma, occurs when there is an overproduction of abnormal anal gland cells. While this condition is not common in cats, any cat can develop this cancer. Common symptoms of anal gland cancer in cats include: Difficulty having a bowel movement Constipation Blood or other abnormal discharge during a bowel movement A change in the consistency of the feces and/or smaller stool size Increased litter box use Swelling or inflammation (redness) around the anal area Overgrooming of the anal area Holding the tail in a different position than usual Decreased appetite Lethargy The exact cause of anal gland cancer in cats is unknown, but there may be a genetic component to this type of cancer. There may also be a link to elevated blood calcium (hypercalcemia ) secondary to changes in the parathyroid gland from cancer cells. A thorough medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests will aid a veterinarian in diagnosing anal gland cancer in cats. A physical exam will likely show changes in the anal area that may include: Swelling Inflammation Pain Bleeding or pus Ulcers/wounds of the skin surrounding the anus Common diagnostic tests for anal gland cancer in cats include: A blood panel (CBC and chemistry), which may show elevated blood calcium, with secondary elevations in kidney values and possible elevations in liver values if the tumor is spreading Radiographs (x-rays) of the chest, which may reveal tumor spread into the lungs Abdominal ultrasound , which may show abnormal changes in some of the lymph nodes that are the closest to the anal sacs A cytology slide of the debris from the anal sacs, which may reveal abnormal anal gland cells A biopsy for histopathology review of the abnormal anal gland tissue, which will confirm a diagnosis of anal gland cancer Surgical removal of the anal sacs is the preferred treatment option for anal gland cancer in cats. Chemotherapy is another option, but it is not commonly used in cats with anal gland cancer. Radiation therapy is another possible option, but this is also rarely used in these cases. Surgical removal is not a viable option for anal gland cancer that has spread to the lungs, liver, or other areas of the body. Older cats with other medical issues may also not be good surgery candidates. Supportive care is indicated for cats who are not good candidates for surgery. It may include: Appetite stimulant medication Fluid supplementation (subcutaneous fluids) Stool softeners (such as lactulose or canned pumpkin) Enema to help relieve constipation (administered only by a veterinarian) Complications from surgical removal of the anal sacs can include: Bleeding from the surgery site Poor healing or infection of the surgery site Constipation Fecal incontinence (inability to control a bowel movement) Because the entirety of the tumor(s) may be difficult to remove, tumor regrowth is another possibility. Despite surgery and/or chemotherapy, anal gland cancer in cats has a poor prognosis. The main goal of surgery, chemotherapy, and palliative care should focus on keeping the cat comfortable, with minimal suffering. If the pet parent and veterinarian agree that the cat is suffering with a poor quality of life, humane euthanasia may ultimately be considered.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/anal-gland-disorders-cats,Anal Gland Disorders in Cats,"Anal glands are small pouches inside a cat’s bottom on either side of the anus. Anal glands are also called anal sacs, because they are little sacs lined with glands that produce an odorous brown substance. When a cat has a bowel movement, a little bit of the anal gland secretions is squeezed out with the feces. This unique odor, or “scent signature,” allows cats to readily identify one another’s excrement. Anal gland disorders are not common in cats; however, some cats may struggle with anal gland impaction, which is when the cat’s anal glands become plugged up. When a cat experiences anal gland impaction, the anal gland is unable to empty its contents and becomes swollen and painful. This can lead to severe discomfort in a cat. If they are unable to express the impacted sac, their anal gland can rupture. Most anal gland disorders in cats are readily treated, but anal gland disorders can be a medical emergency. If your cat has an impacted or infected anal gland and is experiencing swelling, pain , or is not willing to eat or cannot get comfortable, seek veterinary care immediately. Anal gland impaction —The blocking of the anal glands. This is caused by the overaccumulation of liquid inside the glands and its inability to be discharged. Anal gland abscess —A painful, inflamed swelling on one or both sides of the anus. This is caused by an infection in the anal glands. Anal gland rupture —The bursting of the abscess on the anal glands. This is caused by an untreated infection and the building pressure of fluid inside the anal glands. Anal gland cancer —The overproduction of abnormal cells within the anal glands, which can cause a tumor to grow within the anal sacs. Symptoms of anal gland disorders in cats may include: Redness or swelling of the rear end near the anus Chewing, biting, or licking at the anus or tail Licking or pulling hair from their back end or tail if unable to reach their anus Dragging the rear end on the ground Draining or oozing wound near the anus Hair loss of tail or belly from excessive grooming Discomfort or pain when sitting or having bowel movements Constipation Hard swellings on either side of the anus Anal gland impaction occurs when the little duct that drains the sac gets plugged up. Often this is the result of an infection by bacteria. There are always bacteria in poop. Sometimes, strains of bacteria can overgrow, or the bacteria can travel the opposite direction through the ducts to the anal sac. Usually this is not problematic, as it is just expelled from the sac when it empties. If the bacteria lead to inflammation or irritation of the duct however, then the sac cannot empty and it serves as a perfect breeding ground for the bacteria to rapidly multiply. This can lead to infection of the anal sac and formation of an abscess, or large pocket filled with pus. Abscesses cause a lot of pain and swelling until they rupture, leaving a draining wound or sore in their wake. Cancer in the anal glands is rare in cats and has a suspected genetic component, with Siamese and Burmese breeds having a higher incidence rate. The most common type of cancer seen in the anal gland is anal sac adenocarcinoma. Normal emptying of the sac is triggered by exercise and passage of stool out of the anus. Obese cats are more likely to struggle with delayed emptying of their anal sacs than cats with a healthy body condition score. Overweight cats tend to exercise less, and thus have less natural emptying of the sacs. Additionally, their extra weight can compress the duct openings, making emptying more challenging. If a cat does not have enough fiber in their diet they can also struggle with soft stools, which affects emptying. Sometimes, genetics plays a role in a cat having tiny openings of their ducts. That means they can more readily become impacted even if your cat has a healthy weight and a good diet. Your veterinarian will start by doing a thorough physical exam. After donning gloves, your vet will palpate (feel) each anal gland in your cat’s rear end. Let your veterinarian know if your cat has had trouble with their anal glands in the past, or if they are experiencing decreased appetite, lethargy , or vomiting . Anal gland disorders can be very painful in cats. If possible, your vet will want to express the anal glands by applying gentle pressure to empty their contents. Don’t be alarmed if your cat seems upset by the procedure. Sometimes sedation is necessary if they are too impacted and/or painful, or if a cat is fractious and will not allow a thorough exam. Most anal gland disorders are diagnosed with a physical exam. If there is a draining sore or wound associated with an anal sac, your veterinarian may elect to do impression smears where they get some of the discharge and look at it under the microscope to identify bacteria. They may also elect to culture the drainage to determine the best antibiotic to clear the infection. If a mass is felt associated with the anal sac, they may remove some of the cells in the mass, then look at the cells under the microscope or send them to a lab for further study. Biopsies may be required if cancer is suspected. Treatment of anal gland disorder in cats is geared toward restoring normal function of the anal gland. If your cat’s anal gland is impacted, treatment may be as simple as manually expressing the gland to empty its contents by hand. Sometimes this requires an infusion to soften the material in the sac if the contents are too hard and dry to be expelled. Sedation may be necessary if the anal gland area is especially swollen, tender or painful. Most of the time this procedure can be done with no need for your cat to be hospitalized. Your veterinarian will then most likely recommend that your cat get on a regular schedule to have their anal glands expressed to prevent future anal gland impaction. If the anal gland is infected, antibiotics may be prescribed. Pain medications—like Onsior® or gabapentin —may also be part of your cat’s treatment. If the anal sac has ruptured, then your cat may need wound care in addition to antibiotics. Very rarely, such as in the case of cancer or chronic infection issues, surgery is recommended to remove the anal gland. Most cats with anal gland disorders respond well to treatment and recover quickly after their anal glands are emptied. Occasionally, like in the case of a ruptured anal gland, they may require additional veterinary visits for wound care during the healing process. A recovery cone is helpful to prevent your cat from licking/chewing at the wound. Sometimes, topical products are recommended during wound care. Be sure to use a recovery cone if a topical is being used so that your cat doesn’t ingest the medication. Never use any products on open wounds without talking to your veterinarian about it first. With nutrition and obesity linked to anal gland disorders in the cats, the best thing you can do as a pet parent to prevent problems with the anal glands is to feed a healthy diet and keep your cat at their optimum body condition. High-fiber diets like Hill’s® Biome and Royal Canin® Fiber Response can be helpful in bulking stool to help your cat’s anal glands express themselves more naturally. Exercise is also helpful. Consider a laser pointer or cat toy to interact with your cat and get them to increase their activity levels to remain at a healthy weight. Several supplements contain fiber and probiotics that may benefit a cat with anal gland disorders. Glandex® for Cats comes in a powder that you can sprinkle on their food to make administration easy. If your cat has been diagnosed with an anal gland disorder , keep them on a regular schedule to have their anal glands expressed to prevent anal gland impaction. Cats that need their anal glands expressed will often lick or chew their rear ends. Sometimes they will pluck hair off their back ends or even their tail. They will occasionally scoot, and sometimes swelling can be seen on either side of the anus. Anal gland abscesses that rupture usually need to be addressed by a veterinarian because antibiotics may be needed to facilitate recovery. Impacted anal glands cannot empty normally and require intervention to have them expressed by hand. Featured Image: mediaphotos/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Corbee R, et al.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_anaphylaxis,Anaphylaxis in Cats,"Anaphylaxis (also called allergic shock or anaphylactic shock) is an extreme allergic reaction that can quickly become a life-threatening event for cats. This is a medical emergency that can be fatal if not promptly treated . Allergies occur when the body mistakes a substance (called an allergen) for a threat and releases cells to fight off the perceived invader. This allergic reaction is usually minor, such as itchy skin or sneezing. But in serious cases, the entire body can react in anaphylactic shock. The reaction may occur with the first exposure to an allergen, but more often it is subsequent encounters that lead to shock. A cat’s lungs are the most common area impacted by anaphylactic shock, which can affect breathing. Other major body systems affected by shock include the gastrointestinal systems (esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, and intestinal tract). Fortunately, this condition is rare in cats. If you suspect your cat is having an anaphylactic reaction, take them to a veterinarian or animal hospital immediately . The most common signs of anaphylaxis occur within seconds to minutes (acute onset): Severe respiratory distress, difficulty breathing Diarrhea Vomiting Excessive drooling Excitement, restlessness Incoordination Pale gums Cold limbs Facial swelling Itchy skin around head and face Seizures Coma Anaphylaxis can be fatal in rare cases. Although the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems are the organs most impacted, anaphylaxis can affect other body systems as well: Respiratory system (lungs) —Difficulty breathing, open-mouth breathing (panting), coughing Gastrointestinal system (stomach, intestines, pancreas, etc.) —Vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, drooling Cutaneous system (skin) ­—Itchy skin anywhere on the body but more prominent around area of allergen contact, facial swelling Cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels) ­—Pale gums, cold limbs Nervous system (brain and spinal cord) —Seizures, incoordination, excitement, restlessness, coma Ocular system (eyes) —Cloudiness or redness in the eyes It’s not possible to predict when anaphylaxis will occur, but cats with known allergies may be at higher risk. This rare but potentially deadly form of shock can occur as an immediate reaction to many things in the environment or from an ingested substance. Specific causes of anaphylaxis in cats include: Venom injected from insects such as bees, wasps, hornets and fire ants. Reptile venom Food Chemotherapy agents Blood transfusions Antibiotic eye ointments containing polymyxin B (this reaction typically occurs within 10 minutes) Surgery to remove heartworms (heartworm ruptures) Medications taken by mouth, such as antibiotics, steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), and opiates. Contrast material used for special imaging such as an MRI Vaccines/antibiotics Physical factors such as cold or exercise Diagnosing anaphylaxis can be difficult because of its widespread impact on the body. A veterinarian will suspect shock based on the sudden onset of characteristic signs following exposure to a known or possible allergen. Uncovering the allergen’s source requires a thorough review of a cat’s medical history, medications, lifestyle, environment, and vaccination history. Any changes to diet should also be reported, including treats and table/human food they ate in the last 24 hours. Your veterinarian will do a complete physical examination to check your cat’s vital functions and run blood work to look for things like excess inflammatory cells (such as mast and white blood cells) and liver enzyme elevations. An ultrasound of the abdomen and x-rays of the chest may be recommended to evaluate the heart, lungs, and other internal organs such as the liver and gallbladder for signs of anaphylaxis. Your veterinarian will likely recommend overnight hospitalization. Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical intervention . While the diagnosis may not be made immediately, your vet will work quickly to treat your cat’s symptoms. The goal of treatment is to stabilize the cat, ensure the airway is clear, and insert an IV catheter to administer fluids, medication, and other therapies. An injection of epinephrine (the hormone adrenaline) will be given to counteract the effects of the immune system reaction. Epinephrine will help stimulate the heart, open the tubes in the airway, and remove the inflammatory cells from the blood stream, which will reduce the symptoms of anaphylaxis. In severe cases, a breathing tube may be inserted to provide oxygen. Other medications such as steroids and antihistamines can also be helpful in the long term and play an important role in preventing a late-phase reaction, a recurrence of clinical symptoms. Cats experiencing anaphylaxis should be monitored closely by a veterinarian for at least 48-72 hours after the reaction, even if the clinical signs appear to improve, because rebound reactions can occur. The prognosis for an anaphylaxis depends on its severity and how fast symptoms progressed. Your vet can help develop strategies to avoid the trigger if it is identified. Allergens can in some cases be uncovered through skin allergen testing. Anaphylactic shock can last from just a few minutes to periods up to 72 hours. Cats that experience anaphylaxis should be monitored closely by a veterinarian for at least 48-72 hours after the reaction. It’s important they are observed for an extended period, because clinical signs can improve and then quickly reappear after several hours. Once the allergen is removed, it can still take a few days for all symptoms to resolve. Animals often require close monitoring in a vet hospital for 24-48 hours after treatment has begun, and up to 72 hours after the signs began.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/anaplasmosis-cats,Anaplasmosis in Cats,"Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne illness. It’s more common in humans, dogs , and other animals, but cats do contract it in rare instances. Cats develop anaplasmosis as a result of being bit by a tick that carries the Anaplasma phagocytophilum bacterium. As with some other tick-borne diseases, a tick must remain attached to your cat for more than 24 hours for the infection to be transferred. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anaplasmosis is found across the United States, but higher rates of the illness are reported in the Northeast, Midwest, and West Coast. It is found in areas where there is a high tick population. In the Northeast, infections are most common in May, June and October. Cats usually develop symptoms within a few days to a week after the tick bite. Clinical signs may include: Poor appetite Lethargy Fever Stiff, painful joints Limping or trouble walking Enlarged lymph nodes Bloody nose Dark bloody stool Bruising Wobbly gait Seizures Conjunctivitis Protrusion of the third eyelid (inside the eye) Not all cats carrying the anaplasma bacteria will have symptoms. Rarely, those that have a strong immune system will get sick for a short period of time and then recover quickly. The bacteria are transmitted to cats by ticks that carry the disease. Infections are highest in the late spring and autumn, when both nymph and adult ticks are most mobile. Anaplasmosis is transmitted to cats 24 to 48 hours after the tick attaches to your cat. Anaplasmosis is not contagious from cat to cat, but it is common that all cats in the same home will get the disease at once, due to the same tick exposure. Your veterinarian will obtain a full history, including when a tick bite might have occurred, and conduct a complete physical examination. If the vet suspects this illness, they will order blood tests and urine tests to investigate further. Your veterinarian might be able to diagnosis anaplasmosis by examining a blood sample under a microscope and spotting the bacteria. This is not always possible, and often requires a clinical pathologist because the organism is difficult to visualize. In most instances, your veterinarian will be looking for blood tests to indicate that your cat has thrombocytopenia (fewer platelets) or anemia (fewer blood cells); these findings suggest an Anaplasma infection because the organism affects different cells in the blood. Anaplasmosis can be confused with other illnesses that cause fever, lethargy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, stiff joints, or dark stool. One or more of the following laboratory tests is performed to confirm the diagnosis. Wright’s stain is a special stain used on a cat’s blood sample that is examined in a microscope. This helps your veterinarian differentiate blood cells, making an infection of the blood more apparent as it allows for the bacteria to be seen on the blood smear. This used to be the primary way that veterinarians diagnosed anaplasmosis. Immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) tests for antibodies in the serum of the blood that react with the Anaplasma organism. The serum is the part of the blood left behind when all of the cells are removed by centrifugation ( high-speed spinning of a blood sample). This test also uses a microscopic evaluation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is another blood test. Typically, this test will not become positive until at least 8 days post-infection. This is a common test for cats suspected of having a long-term case of anaplasmosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the presence of Anaplasma DNA in a biological sample, usually whole blood in cats. It is a more sensitive test done without a microscope. Molecular detection by PCR is very useful to quickly identify this organism and confirm reinfection or carrier status. This is the most common way that anaplasmosis will be diagnosed by your veterinarian, who will send a blood sample from your cat to an outside laboratory for analysis. If your cat has severe anemia or thrombocytopenia, they might need a blood transfusion. Most of the time, anaplasmosis is treated with an oral antibiotic such as doxycycline. This drug works well but it has been associated with a narrowing of the esophagus, so it’s important to give your cat at least 5 milliliters of water or food after each dose. Cats generally feel better 24-28 hours after starting the antibiotic, but do not stop administering the medication. Closely follow the vet’s instructions and administer every pill provided to your cat. A typical course of antibiotics lasts 2 to 4 weeks. With correct treatment, the prognosis for cats with anaplasmosis is good. If your cat doesn’t seem to improve within a few days of starting antibiotics, they should be tested for other vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease . Most cats make a full recovery from anaplasmosis, but your veterinarian will want to monitor them afterward to be sure that the infection has cleared. Expect to bring your cat in for checkups two months after finishing antibiotics; treatment is considered successful once your cat has had two to three consecutive negative tests . To reduce your cat’s chances of developing anaplasmosis in the future, limit outdoor access, use preventive medications , and conduct daily tick checks. Year-round tick prevention should be part of your cat’s preventive care, especially if ticks are common in your area. Cats can still get ticks even if they are on monthly preventive treatment. It’s best to check your cat often if you live in an area where ticks are prevalent and after your cat comes in from outdoors (if applicable). Ticks are typically found near a cat’s neck, head, or ears, and in the creases under their legs. Yes. It is more commonly seen in dogs and other animals, but in rare cases cats do get this tick-borne infection. Symptoms may include those associated with bleeding (like a bloody nose or bruising) as well as poor appetite, lethargy, fever, or trouble walking. Yes. Oxytetracycline antibiotics are effective in treating anaplasmosis. The most common antibiotic in this family of medications that will be prescribed to your cat is doxycycline. Anaplasmosis can be fatal if left untreated. Some cats carry the infection for a long time without any noticeable symptoms, but there is a risk that symptoms will eventually arise.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/anemia-in-cats,Anemia in Cats,"Anemia in cats is the deficiency of red blood cells and hemoglobin (or both) in a cat’s blood. Red blood cells (RBCs), which are made by the bone marrow, are the main way oxygen is carried to the body’s tissues and organs. Specifically, an iron-containing protein in RBCs called hemoglobin carries the oxygen. When a cat is anemic, the decrease in RBCs and/or hemoglobin leads to decreased oxygen flow to the body’s organs. This decrease in oxygen may result in damage to organs like the heart, lungs, and kidneys, potentially causing failure. Anemia in cats is often a medical emergency and can become life-threatening. If you are noticing that your cat has pale gums , is lethargic , is collapsing , and/or has other signs of anemia, seek emergency veterinary attention. Some causes of anemia, though emergent, may be treatable and have a good prognosis. Other cases, such as cats who are anemic with chronic kidney disease , may have a shortened life expectancy. Anemia in cats is broadly categorized as either regenerative or non-regenerative. Regenerative anemias —When the bone marrow produces enough RBCs to correct the anemia. The cat will have a low red blood cell count, but there will be immature RBCs in circulation, indicating the body is trying to replace what it has lost. Non-regenerative anemias —When the bone marrow is not able to correct for the deficiency of RBCs, either because it’s not functioning properly or because the body’s resources have been exhausted. An anemia can also be non-regenerative if it’s caught too early before the body has had a chance to respond to the loss of RBCs. There are many potential causes of anemia, and some causes can co-exist at the same time. Symptoms of anemia include some—or all the following: Lethargy Pale gums (sometimes the gums are yellow, indicating jaundice) Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Increased heart rate Weakness or collapse Decreased appetite Anemia isn’t a disease itself but rather secondary to diseases or conditions in the body that cause anemia. The causes of anemia can be broken down into three broad categories. This includes blood loss, destruction of RBCs, and a failure to produce new RBCs. Blood loss can be internal (inside the body), external (outside the body), or both. Some common causes of blood loss in cats include: Trauma, such as being hit by car Fleas/ticks that suck blood from the body—this can be significant in newborn kittens Hookworm infestations that feed on the blood in the intestines Bleeding tumors Severe stomach ulcers Diseases that prevent proper blood clotting such as hemophilia Anticoagulant rodenticide toxicity (when a cat ingests rat poison that prevents blood clotting, leading to bleeding) Post-surgical complications, such as a suture on a blood vessel coming undone or breaking Destruction of RBCs (also called hemolysis) can occur due to the following: Immune mediated hemolytic anemia (where the cat’s immune system attacks and destroys its RBCs) Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection or feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) Certain blood parasites such as Mycoplasma haemofilis (formerly known as Haemobartonella felis ), Cytauxzoon felis , and Babesia felis which are spread to cats through tick bites Toxins and chemicals from onions , zinc, copper, or acetaminophen (Tylenol) Drugs, including reactions to antibiotics and antiparasitic agents Genetic diseases such as pyruvate kinase deficiency in Abyssinian and Somali cats Neonatal isoerythrolysis, a condition in newborn kittens when the blood type of the kitten and the mother cat are not compatible Low phosphate, seen in refeeding syndrome, which occurs in cats who have been starved and then suddenly start eating a lot again, causing electrolyte abnormalities Cancer Failure to produce new RBCs means the bone marrow that produces RBCs is unable to keep up with the demand for new ones. When a cat is anemic, the bone marrow should be able to produce more RBCs to compensate. Reasons for failure to produce new RBCs include: Anemia of chronic disease—Any chronic disease or illness can lead to anemia due to long-term inflammation that decreases RBC production. Chronic conditions include chronic infection, tumors, and disorders of the hormone system (such as hypothyroidism ). This is the most common type of anemia in animals. Chronic kidney disease—The kidneys produce a hormone called erythropoietin, which stimulates the development of RBCs by the bone marrow. With significant kidney disease, the kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin, decreasing RBC production (which leads to anemia). Severe nutritional deficiencies or imbalances Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Autoimmune disease or inflammation affecting the bone marrow Chemicals or toxins affecting the bone marrow Cancer affecting the bone marrow or RBC directly Your vet will perform a physical exam on your cat, followed by blood work. The blood work will show that your cat has a low red blood cell count or a low hematocrit (percentage of blood that is made of RBCs). The blood work may show other changes, such as a low platelet count or high white blood cell counts, which your veterinarian may use to help determine what type of anemia your cat has. After a pet is diagnosed with anemia, your veterinarian will recommend additional tests to determine the underlying cause of the anemia. If there are no signs of external blood loss (bleeding from wound, nose , etc.), internal bleeding will be ruled out. This is done using diagnostic imaging such as X-rays and/or ultrasound. If no signs of bleeding are noted, your veterinarian will perform additional blood tests. They may also recommend testing for diseases spread by tick bites, or other specialized tests. A urinalysis should be performed to check your cat’s organ function and assess other causes of anemia. Your vet may also take a fecal sample from your cat. This is to rule out parasites. A FeLV/FIV snap test is another important test to help your vet determine the cause of your cat’s anemia. If there is concern the cat’s bone marrow is not responding properly, your veterinarian may recommend a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy to collect a sample of bone marrow for analysis. For this procedure, your cat is usually under anesthesia. A needle is inserted into the bone to collect a sample of the marrow. The sample is then sent to a specialty lab that can examine the bone marrow under a microscope. Often, severely anemic cats will be sent to a local veterinary emergency hospital for hospitalization, 24-hour care, blood transfusions, advanced diagnostics, and consultation with specialists. In cases of severe anemia, a blood transfusion will likely be needed. Once the cat is stabilized, attention will be directed at identifying and treating the underlying cause of the anemia. Treatment will vary based on the underlying cause of the anemia but may include: Steroids ( prednisolone ) and other immunosuppressive medications like cyclosporine or chlorambucil Antibiotics Gastroprotectant medications, which are medications that coat any ulcers and prevent worsening of vomiting if present Deworming medication Surgery in the case of a bleeding tumor or a complication from a previous surgery Darbepoeitin, a medication given to cats with chronic kidney disease to replace erythropoietin Iron supplementation If your cat has gone through trauma, surgery may be needed to stop the bleeding and address the anemia. If the anemia is severe or persistent, additional transfusions, oxygen therapy, and other supportive care may be needed. Severely anemic cats will likely need to be hospitalized for two to seven days while they receive treatment. Severely anemic cats or those with autoimmune conditions or cancer can have poor or uncertain prognosis. These cats may need long-term treatment. Many cats with mild anemia—when treated early, and in overall good health—will typically make a full recovery and have no long-term effects. However, some cats with mild anemias, such as those with chronic kidney disease, may get progressively worse, even with treatment. The prognosis for cats with blood loss, secondary to trauma, will vary depending on the extent of the trauma and how quickly they receive treatment. Not all causes of anemia in cats are preventable, but there are steps you can take to decrease your cat’s overall risk. These include: Keep your cat indoors to reduce the risk of trauma and transmission of diseases like FeLV or FIV. Vaccinate your cat against FeLV. Keep your cat on parasite prevention that includes intestinal worms, fleas, and ticks. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for how often your cat needs wellness exams and blood work . This will help you catch conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, early. Earlier intervention can slow progression. Feed your cat a regular, healthy diet . Keep toxic substances, such as onions or acetaminophen, out of reach of your cat. After surgical procedures, follow your veterinarian’s recommendations regarding activity restriction. Anemic cats may benefit from appetite stimulants like maropitant citrate (Cerenia®) . You can also try feeding something extra special like warm canned food . Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for managing the underlying cause of anemia. A low blood count can be caused by blood loss, the destruction of red blood cells, or a failure of the body to make enough red blood cells.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_anisocoria,Anisocoria in Cats: Why Your Cat’s Eyes Are Different Pupil Sizes,"miniseries/E+ via Getty Images If you’re spending time with your furry feline and you notice the pupils of their eyes are not the same size, it can be alarming. This could be a condition known as anisocoria. If you have just noticed this for the first time, visit a veterinarian immediately so the underlying cause can be identified and treated. Delaying treatment can put your cat’s vision at risk. Anisocoria in cats refers to an eye condition in which the pupils are different sizes. There are many potential causes, ranging in severity. A cat’s pupil size is controlled by the nervous system. When these nerve pathways are disrupted, the pupils don’t react to light as they should—so one may dilate while the other constricts, resulting in two different pupil sizes. Anisocoria should be treated as a medical emergency because it often develops from serious underlying health issues . If you notice one pupil suddenly becoming larger than the other, call your veterinarian immediately. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial for a positive outcome. Several health issues can cause a cat to have pupils of different sizes, including: Trauma or injury Horner’s syndrome Glaucoma Uveitis Corneal ulcers Aging Bacterial or viral infections (such as FeLV ) Toxin ingestion (such as permethrins ) Medication overdose (such as ivermectin ) Eye or brain tumors Optic neuritis In addition to different pupil size, accompanying symptoms of anisocoria may include: Eye redness Eye discharge Pawing at the eye Squinting Cloudy cornea (outer part of the eye) Droopy eyelids Prominent third eyelid Lethargy Decreased appetite If a cat has pupils of different sizes, they should be seen by a veterinarian promptly. At the clinic, the veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam to look for abnormalities in the cat’s condition and will ask when the signs began, whether the cat may have ingested anything unusual, and if there was any recent trauma. Additional tests that may help determine the cause of anisocoria include: Complete ophthalmic exam : Using special tools such as an ophthalmoscope and tonometer to check eye pressure, internal eye structures, and nerve function Neurological evaluation : To check eye nerve reflexes and function Bloodwork : to assess overall health and organ function Urinalysis : To rule out systemic (whole-body) illnesses that may be contributing to anisocoria Blood pressure test : High blood pressure can affect the retina and the nerves within the eye Imaging : X-rays , ultrasound, or CT scans to identify trauma or tumors Treatment of anisocoria in cats is directed at the underlying cause and may last from a couple of days to a few weeks. A veterinarian may prescribe: Eye ointment (such as Terramycin ) Antibiotics (such as doxycycline ) Pain medications (such as Onsior ) Anti-inflammatories (such as prednisolone ) Activated charcoal (to be administered for toxin ingestion) Surgery (to correct physical trauma or remove tumors) Additional medications may be recommended based on your cat’s specific condition. Some cats may need hospitalization and supportive care to treat their underlying health issues before continuing their recovery at home. In many cases, anisocoria can be resolved when the underlying cause is treated successfully. The prognosis is better when treatment is started promptly. If left untreated, serious complications such as blindness can occur. Sometimes anisocoria becomes permanent, especially if the nerves that control pupil function are damaged due to trauma. Yes. Anisocoria can signal a serious underlying health issue and should be addressed by a veterinarian right away. Yes. Anisocoria can result from an underlying infectious disease, including feline leukemia virus (FeLV). No. In cats, both pupils are normally the same size at the same time. If one is larger or smaller, schedule a veterinary exam as soon as possible.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_l-form_bacterial_infections,Antibiotic-resistant Bacterial Infections in Cats,"PetMD Editorial L-form bacterial infections are caused by bacterial variants with defective or absent cell walls. That is, L-form bacteria are defective variations of bacterial cells, which can be almost any type of bacteria. L-forms are different from most other forms of bacteria in the respect that cell walls are an important component of organized cell division. While L-forms are still able to divide, creating more of themselves, they lack the same organizational structure as bacteria with cell walls. L-forms replicate without regard to size, big and small, rather than being of one standard size. They have been found throughout nature, in humans, animals, and plants. L-form bacteria are formed as a spontaneous variant of bacteria, or when cell wall synthesis is inhibited or impaired by antibiotics (e.g., penicillin), specific immunoglobulins, or lysosomal enzymes that degrade the cell walls. They can be induced from virtually all gram- positive and negative bacteria under suitable conditions. They occur sporadically in cats, and are most common in free-roaming cats of all ages. The site of infection is typically a surgical or bite wound. Other signs of L-form bactera infection include: Bites, scratches, or trauma may allow the organism to enter the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Formation is also encouraged by antibiotic treatment of the host, resistance of the host, suitability of the site for establishment of the infective bacterium, and relatively low to moderate virulence of the infecting bacterium. L-form bacteria are difficult organisms to isolate and identify. Using a process of differential diagnosis, which is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately, the veterinarian will make a diagnosis by putting all of the signs and symptoms together, along with any consistent laboratory results, to come to a conclusion. Your doctor will also collect some of the fluid from any draining lesions, as well as joint fluid for analysis. Gentle cleaning of the wound will help to degrade the fragile L-form organisms. In most cases, doctors allow the open wounds to heal by secondary intention; that is, the open edges of the wound are not intentionally closed (e.g., by stitches), but are allowed to heal by themselves, growing new tissue over the wound. The main treatment in this case is by cleansing the wound, applying antibiotic ointment to the wound, and applying fresh bandages. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications such as antibiotics to treat the symptoms as well as the disease; however, these organisms are resistant and difficult to target with antibiotics. The fever usually breaks within 24-48 hours. In many cases, arthritic symptoms continue to persist. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_cold_agglutinin_disease,Antibodies that Attack Blood Cells at Lower Temperatures in Cats,"PetMD Editorial This is a rare type II autoimmune disorder in which antibodies that attack red blood cells have enhanced activity at temperatures of less than 99° F (37.2° C). The term agglutinin refers to an antibody that causes antigens, such as red blood cells or bacteria, to adhere to each each other. Cold agglutinins with low thermal capacity are usually associated with direct red blood cell agglutination (adhesion) at low body temperatures in the peripheral blood vessel network (i.e., the vessels outside of the main circulatory network). Cold limbs or other peripheral clotting phenomena are initiated or intensified by exposure to cold. Fixation of complement and hemolysis (the release of hemogloblin in the blood stream when a red blood cell breaks) is a warm-reactive process occurring at high body temperatures; therefore, patients may have very high concentrations of cold agglutinins, but these antibodies may be unable to hemolyze red blood cells (erythrocytes) at the warmer temperatures achieved in the bloodstream. Most cold agglutinins cause little or no shortening of red blood cell life span. High thermal amplitude cold agglutinins (rare) may cause sustained hemolysis, but the resulting anemia is often mild and stable. Exposure to cold may enhance binding of cold agglutinins and complement mediated release of hemoglobin within the vessels (intravascular hemolysis). A low titer (concentration test) of naturally-occurring cold agglutinins (usually 1:32 or less) may be found in healthy cats, but this is without clinical significance. The disease has a genetic basis; however, mean age and range, breed, and sex predilections are unknown. The condition is more likely to occur in colder climates. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Diagnosis is made by the historical findings, such as exposure to cold, the results of the physical examination, and demonstrating cold agglutination (adhesion of red blood cells) in vitro. Skin lesions typically present as inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (erythema), acrocyanosis, and ulceration of the tips of the ears and tail, nose and feet. Other associated conditions to rule out include hepatocutaneous syndrome(skin disease caused caused by liver disease); erythema multiforme (reaction to infection or medication); toxic epidermic necrolysis (blistering and peeling); dermatomyositis (skin rash caused by a muscle disease), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) – bleeding into the skin; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); lymphoreticular neoplasms (cancer caused by proliferation of red cells in the lymphs); frostbite; lead poisoning; and pemphigus (an autoimmune disease). A diagnosis of anemia should be demonstrated by blood tests to help distinguish warm antibody hemolytic anemia (autoimmune disease) from other causes of red blood cell destruction/loss. Macroscopic hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells) in vitro may lead to rouleaux formation (stacks of red blood cells, as with coin rolls); mimicking erythrocyte agglutination (red blood cell clumping) on a glass slide. Your cat will need to be hospitalized in a warm environment until its health has stabilized and the disease is nonprogressive. Supportive care and wound management depend on clinical signs. If necrosis involving the tail tip or feet is severe, amputation may be required. Removal of the spleen is of little assistance in patients with IgM-mediated hemolytic disorders, but may be helpful in those with therapy-resistant IgG-mediated hemolytic anemia. Animals that have suffered from this condition are prone to relapse. Keep your cat in a warm environment at all times to prevent relapse. Prognosis is guarded to fair and recovery may take weeks.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/behavioral/anxiety-disorders-cats,Anxiety Disorders in Cats,"Cats are considered both predator and prey animals. This makes them especially prone to stress and anxiety because they must remain constantly vigilant. While your cat likely doesn’t have to worry about wild animals interrupting their afternoon snooze on the couch, they can still be affected by anxiety disorders. According to some estimates , about 20–25% of feline veterinary patients exhibit anxious behaviors. Feline anxiety is nervousness or worry triggered when a cat anticipates a danger or threat. This can occur even if no real danger is present. Anxiety causes the cat’s body to release hormones that prepare them to face the challenge or escape, typically referred to as the fight-or-flight response. While an anxiety disorder is not a medical emergency for cats, prolonged stress can lead to serious health consequences, such as feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) or dermatologic issues. Common anxiety issues in cats include: General anxiety —Numerous issues can cause chronic generalized anxiety in cats. Noise-associated anxiety —Many cats experience anxiety associated with loud noises. Separation anxiety —Some cats experience anxiety when they are separated from their primary pet parent. Cats who are female, who live in a home with only one person or with no other pets, or who were abandoned are more likely to have separation anxiety. In addition, Siamese , Burmese , and Tonkinese cats seem to have a high risk for the condition. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—Some stressed cats develop OCD, a condition that causes them to exhibit excessive or repetitive behavior such as overgrooming , constant vocalization , and destructive chewing or scratching . Persians , Siamese, and Burmese cats are predisposed to OCD. The symptoms a cat has of an anxiety disorder can depend on what is causing the anxiety. Cats who have separation anxiety, for example, may be extremely clingy and become agitated when they anticipate their favorite pet parent’s imminent departure. But there are also a variety of possible generalized signs when cats feel anxious. Other feline anxiety disorder signs can include: Body language changes —Your cat can’t speak, but they can tell you how they are feeling through their body language . Signs that indicate your whiskered friend is anxious include keeping their tail close to their body, avoiding eye contact, having dilated pupils , flicking their tail, staring, or holding their ears back. Hiding or escaping —When threatened, many cats hide, and they may scratch or chew on doors or windows if they feel trapped. Inappropriate urination —Anxious cats often avoid their litter box. Overgrooming —Self-licking calms cats, and an anxious cat may groom excessively, in some cases causing hair loss or wounds at the grooming site. Excessive vocalization —Cats often meow to get your attention, but anxious cats often meow excessively and typically in a different tone than their usual meow. Appetite changes —As in humans, anxiety can cause your feline friend to eat less or more than usual . Gastrointestinal (GI) issues —Some anxious cats experience GI issues such as vomiting or diarrhea . Reactivity —Anxiety may make your cat act reactively toward you or other pets or people in your home. Numerous factors can trigger a cat’s anxiety. Common causes of feline anxiety disorders include: Illness —Any health problem can lead to feline anxiety, so if your cat is showing symptoms of anxiety, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. Pain — Arthritis is extremely common in cats, but they often show no physical signs, such as limping , to indicate they’re in pain . If left untreated, chronic pain can cause significant anxiety. Trauma —If your cat undergoes a traumatic event, the fear they experience may trigger anxiety. Loud noises —Loud noises such as thunder , fireworks , the vacuum cleaner, or nearby construction can cause phobia-type anxiety. Change —Any change to your feline friend’s environment or schedule can lead to an anxiety problem. Examples include rearranging the furniture, visiting the veterinarian, introducing a new pet to the family, and children going back to school. Improper socialization —Kittens should be exposed to numerous sights, sounds, and situations for the first several months of their life. If they aren’t properly socialized, new experiences can make them anxious. Separation —If your cat is overly attached to you, they may experience anxiety when you are separated. Seek veterinary care if your cat is showing signs of anxiety. Providing your veterinarian with a thorough history of changes in your cat’s environment helps them determine the cause of your cat’s anxiety. In addition, a video of your cat behaving anxiously is helpful. Because illness and pain often cause feline anxiety, your veterinarian will perform diagnostic tests—which may include blood work, urinalysis, and X-rays—to rule out any underlying health issues. Any underlying health condition should be addressed as the first step in treating your cat’s anxiety disorder. If your veterinarian determines that a health issue is not causing your cat’s anxiety disorder, the following treatment management strategies may be recommended to alleviate your cat’s anxiety: Preventing exposure —When possible, prevent exposure to whatever triggers your cat’s anxiety. Medication — Anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants can help manage your feline friend’s anxiety disorder. Your veterinarian can determine the right medication and dose for your cat. Behavior modification —Techniques to modify your cat’s behavior can also help lessen their anxiety. Approaches include: Desensitization —Desensitization involves exposing your cat to their anxiety trigger at a low enough level that they don’t react, and gradually increasing the intensity. For example, if your feline friend is afraid of a certain noise, play a recording of the noise at a low level and gradually increase the volume as long as they don’t show anxiety signs. Counterconditioning —Through counterconditioning, you help your cat form a positive association with their anxiety trigger. For example, if your cat is afraid of the vacuum cleaner, give them a treat before and after you vacuum the house. If these methods don’t successfully assuage your kitty’s anxiety or fears, and their anxiety disorder is affecting their (and possibly your) quality of life, it’s time to seek the help of a veterinary behaviorist. Treatment for feline anxiety disorders is often long-term, and moderate or severe cases may require lifelong management. Minimum treatment for mild cases typically lasts four to six months. To reduce your cat’s anxiety and stress, follow these tips: Leave your cat’s carrier out so they aren’t frightened of it when they have to go to the veterinarian. Don’t use incense, fragrance plug-ins , essential oils , or scented candles in your home—they can irritate your cat’s sensitive nose. Ensure your cat’s litter box setup is acceptable by cleaning the box frequently, placing it in a convenient but quiet place, and providing at least two litter boxes for every cat in your home. When having guests over, create a quiet cat-safe zone where your feline family member can stay during the gathering. Leave music playing at a low volume in that area to help mute the party noise. Provide sufficient physical exercise and mental enrichment to prevent boredom and keep your cat engaged. Certain over-the-counter calming products for cats can also help lower your kitty’s anxiety levels. Examples include: Diffusers Collars Sprays Supplements Anxiety vests When adopting a new kitten, expose them to as many new experiences as possible. Teach your kitten to enjoy time alone by providing a fun food puzzle toy when you leave the house. Anxiety disorders are a significant issue for our feline friends that can affect their health and quality of life. If you feel your cat is affected by an anxiety problem, contact your veterinarian to rule out a medical issue and to get advice on how to help relieve your whiskered friend’s stress. Yes. Cats who have noise-associated phobias and other severe anxiety-related conditions experience feelings similar to those in people having panic attacks. This is why recognizing and treating these conditions is so important. Calming diffusers, collars, and sprays have synthetic feline pheromones to help your feline friend feel safe and secure, and calming supplements such as Zylkene® contain a natural ingredient found in cow’s milk that promotes relaxation in cats.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/behavioral/c_ct_thunderstorm_phobias,Are Cats Afraid of Thunderstorms?,"Thunderstorm phobia in cats is an exaggerated fear response to storm conditions such as thunder, lightning, heavy rain, and strong winds. Because thunderstorms are loud, bright, and sudden, they can alarm anyone, including an already nervous cat. Cats with thunderstorm phobia immediately become anxious when they hear a storm approaching, and they sense changes in barometric pressure before and during a storm. Symptoms can include: Hiding Shaking Drooling Panting Acting restless Panicking/bolting Increased vocalizing Inappropriate urination/defecation Decreased appetite Destructive behavior Increased heart rate (tachycardia) Cats with thunderstorm phobia respond with fear to loud and unexpected noises and unexpected flashes of light. Like many other animals, cats are also sensitive to and detect subtle changes in the atmosphere’s pressure brought on by thunderstorms. Some cats from unknown, abusive, or neglectful backgrounds may also be more fearful of storms, and loud noises may be triggering. Cats tend to have a flight response in uncertain situations. If there is a history of confinement, neglect, or a situation where a cat is unable to escape, it may exacerbate the potential for phobias to develop. Veterinarians diagnose thunderstorm phobia in cats by: Asking about the history of your cat’s suspected storm fear Performing a complete physical exam to rule out other ailments or diseases (if a cat is hiding more than usual and not acting like itself for longer periods of time, there may be an underlying medical issue) Ordering a blood test to see if there are changes in red and/or white blood cell numbers and elevated blood sugar (glucose) Increases in red and white blood cell counts can occur in times of stress, although increased red blood cell counts secondary to stress are more common in dogs Elevated blood glucose is extremely common in stressed cats Treatment of thunderstorm phobia in cats may include: Prescription medications such as acepromazine , gabapentin , and trazodone, which all typically have sedative effects OTC supplements such as oral calming chews and treats that contain tryptophan, Zylkene® , hemp, and/or colostrum Tryptophan is a building block for serotonin and melatonin, both of which can cause relaxation and sleepiness. For Zylkene®, there has been research around a substance in the mother’s milk that might contribute to relaxation for newborns after nursing. Alpha-casozepine, the unique-derived protein in Zylkene®, promotes a sense of relation and is a non-sedative. While the use of hemp is still being researched in cats , it may have calming effects that act on receptors in the brain. However, the use of hemp in cats and dogs is still controversial to many veterinarians. There has been little research on colostrum to determine if it has a calming effect, but it may help alleviate anxiety-related digestion issues. In addition to a treatment plan that may include medication, there are some additional ways you can help to calm your cat, including: Using feline pheromone-based calming diffusers. The Feliway® is a diffuser that is plugged into an electrical outlet and emits the pheromone into a small space. Using compression vests. The ThunderShirt® is a compression vest that creates a security blanket to keep your cat calm. Creating a small and quiet safe space where your cat can take refuge with a favorite bed/blanket/toy/treat Snuggling up with your cat in a quiet room (if your cat is scared but does not try to run or hide) While some cats may become fully desensitized to thunderstorms after receiving treatment, other cats may have a lifelong phobia. It is important to be consistent with the approach you choose to calm your cat. It is equally important to try different approaches (as recommended above) if one approach doesn’t seem to be working after several attempts. Thunderstorms are loud, bright, and sudden, which can alarm a cat who is afraid. A cat with thunderstorm phobia reacts with fear to thunder, lightning, heavy rain, and strong winds. Cats may even sense changes in the barometric pressure before and during a storm. While thunderstorm phobia is more common in dogs, cats may be afraid of storms as well. Some cats respond with fear to loud and unexpected noises, and to unexpected flashes of light brought on by storms. Cats may also be sensitive to and detect subtle changes in the barometric pressure of the atmosphere. Some cats from unknown, abusive, or neglected backgrounds may also be more fearful of storms.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/_ct_heart_trauma_arrhythmia,Arrhythmias after Blunt Heart Trauma in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The prevalence of serious arrhythmias after blunt trauma is relatively low but some patients develop clinically important rhythm disturbances following trauma to the heart. Therefore, the heart rhythm of all victims of trauma should be carefully assessed. Traumatic myocarditis is the term applied to the syndrome of arrhythmias – irregular heartbeats – that sometimes complicates a blunt trauma injury to the heart. It is a misnomer, because heart muscle injuries are more likely to take the form of cell death than inflammation (as the term myocarditis suggests). Direct heart injury may not be necessary for development of post traumatic arrhythmia. Non-heart related conditions are likely to have equal or greater importance in causing arrhythmias. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (abnormal patterns of electrical heart beat activity starting in the ventricles) occur in most affected patients. Ventricular rhythms that complicate blunt trauma are often relatively slow and are detected only during pauses in the normal rhythm. They are most appropriately referred to as accelerated idioventricular rhythms (AIVRs), which is recognized by a heart rate that is greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm) but generally less than 160 bpm. Usually, these rhythms are harmless. However, dangerous ventricular tachycardias can also complicate a blunt trauma and can also evolve from seemingly benign AIVRs, placing the patient at risk for sudden death. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Blood tests can be done to check for high serum troponin concentrations, a protein that is involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contractions, which would suggest myocardial necrosis. Arterial blood gas analysis and pulse oximetry should be used to determine if the patient is lacking in blood oxygen (hypoxemic). Further diagnostic testing will include X-ray imaging to determine the type of traumatic injuries that are present, and electrocardiogram (ECG) to analyze the ventricular arrhythmias. Your cat will be given fluid therapy with electrolytes (if needed) and prescribed painkillers. Oxygen therapy should be given if your cat is hypoxemic. If pneumothorax (air free in the chest cavity - outside the lungs) is present, it will be treated. Antiarrhythmic therapy will only be given if your cat has AIVRs and clinical signs of arrhythmia. Arrhythmias due to blunt trauma tend to resolve spontaneously within 2-3 days of the beginning of treatment. Anti-arrhythmic therapy can be discontinued after 2-5 days. Although dangerous arrhythmias occasionally complicate blunt trauma, the prognosis for a full recovery usually depends on the severity of extracardiac (outside the heart) injury.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_arsenic_poisoning,Arsenic Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Arsenic is a heavy metal mineral that is commonly included in chemical compounds for consumer products, such as herbicides (chemicals to kill unwanted plants), insecticides (chemicals to kill insects), and as wood preservatives. Most cases of toxicity occur in homes where such compounds are placed carelessly with open excess. Cats typically ingest such compounds accidentally. Toxicity can also occur over a long term, such as when cats are exposed to arsenic by eating grass that is regularly treated with herbicides. In case of acute exposure to arsenic, the following symptoms may be present in an affected cat: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The background history is very important in the diagnosis of arsenic poisoning and your veterinarian will need to know about any arsenic-containing compounds you have at home. Many owners bring their cats to the veterinarian with complaints of a sudden and unexplained episode of vomiting. However, few owners report seeing their cats ingest arsenic-containing compounds, so this may not be the first cause that is apparent. Your veterinarian will perform a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A sample of the stomach contents may also be necessary. Arsenic in the blood stream or stomach contents will confirm the diagnosis. In cases of chronic arsenic poisoning the level of arsenic in the body can be evaluated from a hair sample, as arsenic is deposited in the hair over a course of time. If possible, you should collect a sample of the vomit or diarrhea to take to the veterinarian. This will help to speed the diagnostic process so that your cat can be treated before further damage is done. Acute (sudden) arsenic poisoning is an emergency and time remains the crucial factor for a successful outcome. Vomiting plays a protective role in arsenic poisoning as it expels a large portion of the ingested poisonous material. However, if vomiting is not initiated in the immediate aftermath, your veterinarian will need to perform a gastric lavage (stomach irrigation) to wash out the stomach contents. As arsenic severely damages the liver and kidneys, dialysis is conducted for cats that are in a state of kidney failure due to arsenic poisoning. The main objective of treatment is to flush the poison out of the body; therefore fluid therapy and drugs promoting excretion are commonly employed. Also, some compounds are known to chelate (bind) heavy metals such as arsenic, and are commonly used to bind arsenic that is still present in the body. Chelators work both by slowing the arsenic down before it can cross the blood-brain barrier, and by making it more water-soluble so that it can be washed from the body more effectively. Your veterinarian can employ such antidotes to enhance recovery in your cat. Your cat may need to be admitted into the veterinary hospital for a few days until it has stabilized and is completely out of danger. Conversely, if you actually witnessed your cat consuming the poison, you can act quickly by inducing vomiting, but this must be done immediately following the event. If time elapses from the time of ingestion, only a veterinarian can treat your cat. For immediate first aid, if you are positive that your cat has ingested this toxic substance, try to induce vomiting with a simple hydrogen peroxide solution of one teaspoon per five pounds of body weight – with no more than three teaspoons given at once. This method should only be used if the toxin has been ingested in the previous two hours, and should only be given three times, spaced apart at ten minute intervals. If your cat has not vomited after the third dose, do not use it, or anything further, to try to induce vomiting. Do not use anything stronger than hydrogen peroxide without your veterinarian's assent. Because induced vomiting can be dangerous with some toxins, as some poisons will do more harm coming back through the esophagus than they did going down, do not induce vomiting unless you are absolutely sure of what your cat has ingested. If your cat has already vomited, do not try to force more vomiting. A final word, do not induce vomiting if your cat is unconscious, is having trouble breathing, or is exhibiting signs of serious distress or shock. Whether your cat vomits or not, after the initial care, you must take it to a veterinary facility immediately. After returning from the hospital, allow your cat proper rest and protect it from any source of stress. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for home treatment, such as medication and nutrition. Easily digestible food is often recommended for cats that are recovering from a poisoning. Ensure that all sources of arsenic-compounds are secured or removed. If they must be kept in the home, be sure that they are out of reach of children and pets. Most problems are easily avoided if guidelines for handling and keeping such poisonous compounds are followed. Keep an eye on your cat and if you observe anything unusual in its behavior, immediately consult your veterinarian. Unfortunately, in many cases of heavy intoxication, very few patients survive unless treatment is started very early. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/arthritis-cats,Arthritis in Cats,"Arthritis (also called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthritis) is a chronic, painful, progressive condition involving the joints of cats. As in people, this is commonly associated with aging, and likely impacts between 70% and 90% of cats over 12 years old. Arthritis usually takes years to develop, with many changes occurring in the joints. The cartilage that normally lines and cushions the joint breaks down, allowing bones to rub together abnormally. Nearby bone may splinter and form sharp, bony projections into the joint. These leads to swelling, inflammation, and pain in the joints. Most affected joints include the spine, hip, knees, and elbows—although any joint can develop arthritis. It is a progressive disease, meaning it continues to worsen over time. Because these joint changes cause pain, cats can show decreased mobility and lameness when they have arthritis. While there is no breed or sex predilection for arthritis in cats, it is typically viewed as an aging disease. Health Tools Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps. Some cats with arthritis may not show any obvious signs—they can be very good at hiding their pain! Some obvious signs of arthritis include limping, swollen joints, and muscle wasting. However, cats may display arthritis differently, and make it difficult for owners to recognize. Some cats may become hesitant to jump or play like when they were younger. They may have decreased energy or agility falling when they attempt to jump up or down on surfaces. It may be difficult for them to move their body without pain to groom, so cats may be more unkempt. Some pet parents note changes in posture, such as not sleeping or sitting normally. If arthritis causes pain when they use the litter box, they may associate the litter box as the cause of the pain and start eliminating outside it. It is important to note that these changes do not occur overnight and usually happen gradually. Arthritis can occur without known reasons, although genetics may play a role. This type is most associated with aging. Arthritis can also occur after an injury to the joint. These injuries can be minor in nature, and could be caused by: Ligament injury (such as ACL tear) Immune-mediated diseases, such as immune-mediated non-erosive polyarthritis Tick-borne diseases, like Lyme disease Direct trauma (such as a car accidents or a fall) Infection Congenital defect Arthritis progresses due to the nature of the joint itself. After an injury, the cartilage releases enzymes within the joint that cause further breakdown of the cartilage and collagen, resulting in more inflammation. Veterinarians may suspect arthritis in cats based on their physical exam, but it requires further testing for a definitive diagnosis. However, some cats are stoic and asymptomatic. These cats are most often diagnosed with arthritis incidentally—after feeling abnormalities on an exam or during an X-ray. During a physical exam, veterinarians may find the following in a cat with arthritis: Lameness Changes in gait, posture, or sitting position Difficulties sitting or getting up Swollen or thickened joints Crepitus, or clicks in joints when moving Pain on palpation of joints Decreased range of motion of joints While a veterinarian may strongly suspect arthritis, they need further diagnostics to confirm. X-rays are the standard diagnostic test to easily view bones and joints for changes. X-ray abnormalities include: Joint distention Bony outgrowths Soft-tissue thickening Narrowed joint spaces Calcified free-floating bony lesions (called joint mice) Veterinarians may suggest a trial of pain medications to determine the degree of pain. Arthritis is extremely common with our feline companions, but there are many options to help them feel better and remain active. With appropriate management, we can slow the progression and allow them to lead very full lives. A multi-modal approach typically works best — multiple therapies used together for a better outcome. Obesity is one of the most concerning factors for arthritis. Overweight cats put more strain on their joints. Lowering the weight of a heavy cat with arthritis is the first step to take in easing the strain on their joints. Weight reduction diets can be started. Talk to your veterinarian to discuss the right food and caloric intake for your pet. Other treatment options include medicines, supplements, therapies, and surgery. Here is an overview of treatment possibilities for arthritic cats: Pain Medications: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (like meloxicam and Onsior ) are great at relieving pain and inflammation. However, they can have a significant strain on internal organ function and can have restrictions on the length of treatment. Gabapentin is used for many purposes, and its pain-reliving properties make it a good option for painful, arthritic cats. Opioids can be used, but they require additional precautions and may cause sedation. Polysulfated glycosaminoglycan ( Adequan ): This is an injectable prescription medication that supports joint health by stopping destructive enzymes within the joint. This medication is not labeled for use in cats, so talk to your veterinarian about using it off-label. Amantadine may also provide pain relief in some cats. Frunevetmab (Solensia) is a newer drug using monoclonal antibodies developed specifically for cats with arthritis. There are few studies in cats, but may be a beneficial drug for this treatment. Supplements: Glucosamine/chondroitin: over-the-counter supplement to support cartilage and bones. Use caution with brands – most veterinarians recommend Dasuquin or Cosequin because they have a strong history of safety and effectiveness. Omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the inflammation in joints. In recent years, CBD (cannabidiol, an active ingredient in cannabis) has received attention for its pain-relief qualities. However, there is limited data in pets to know the effectiveness of CBD and similar products. In addition, legal issues surrounding CBD make it difficult to acquire, prescribe, and obtain quality and safe products. Talk to your veterinarian about all pain management options before starting treatments. Medical/Supportive Care: Laser therapy (also known as a cold laser) can dramatically decrease inflammation and pain. Laser treatment typically starts with multiple treatments within a week and then tapers to the lowest effective dose. Acupuncture may help in some cases, although not all cats are agreeable to the process. Stem cell therapy has shown promising work in dogs, horses, and humans, but requires more research in cats. Warm/cold compresses for temporary pain relief, increasing blood flow and decreasing inflammation. Physical therapy can help with weight loss and joint mobility. Surgery is not always the first step, but it may ease the pain from some forms of arthritis. It is important to note that most surgeries involving joints will not guarantee that arthritis will not return over time, but such a procedure may allow a better quality of life. Surgical options include joint fusions, joint replacement, and amputation. Arthritis is not reversible, so cats will never fully recover. But treatments can slow its progression and lead to an increased quality of life. Many cats with arthritis show few clinical signs, so diligent monitoring is essential. Unless a previous disease or trauma occurred, most cats with arthritis are over age 10 when diagnosed—although arthritis may have started years earlier. New studies show around 60% of cats 6 years old have signs of arthritis. As your cat ages, you may notice decreased ability to jump, play, and groom. They may start using the bathroom outside the litter box due to pain. Without treatment, arthritis can progress to debilitating and painful diseases. Talk to your veterinarian about the appropriate steps to treat your cat with arthritis. Because obesity is linked to arthritis, it is best to keep your cat lean. If your cat is already overweight, institute a weight loss program, following your veterinarian’s advice. Ask about arthritis in cats and start using cartilage protectant medications and supplements early. By doing so, you protect the cartilage that is there before it is too late. Many cats show few or no signs of arthritis. You may notice decreased grooming, decreased mobility, and lameness. Most cats are diagnosed over 10 years of age, but arthritis likely starts much sooner than that. Talk to your veterinarian to determine your cat’s appropriate weight and what you can do to slow arthritis’ progression. Tilley L, Smith F. The 5-Minute Veterinary Consult: Canine and Feline.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/ascites-cats,Ascites in Cats,"Ascites—also known as abdominal effusion—is the buildup of fluid in the abdomen, sometimes causing the belly to visibly swell. The fluid that collects in the abdomen can be composed of a variety of substances, including blood, urine, or serum (the liquid component of blood). These substances can enter the abdomen due to damaged blood vessels or organs, organ enlargement, abdomen tumor growths, or abdomen inflammation. Ascites is an uncomfortable condition because the accumulation of fluid pushes on the diaphragm, stomach, and intestines. This can cause breathing difficulties, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and low energy, among other issues. Because fluid in the abdomen is more of a symptom of an illness than its own disease, a veterinary exam and diagnostic testing are required to determine the underlying cause. Unfortunately, the cause of ascites is typically serious. Click here to download this medical illustration. The amount of fluid in the abdomen influences the development of symptoms. When the amount of fluid is relatively small, there may be no symptoms and X-rays are needed to diagnose ascites accurately. The buildup of large amounts of fluid in the abdomen may cause cats to develop noticeable symptoms, including the most common: Abdominal discomfort—cats resist abdomen examination or vocalize while lying down Abdominal swelling Trouble breathing (such as increased breathing rate and increased effort) and decreased ability to engage in physical activity Decreased appetite Low energy and weakness Coughing Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Changes in body temperature, either fever or hypothermia Weight gain Muscle wasting ( loss of muscle tissue that makes a cat’s hip bones, ribs, and spine more easily felt and seen, though the amount of body fat may remain the same) Increased thirst and urination Heart murmur and weak pulse, if heart failure is the cause Cats can develop ascites for many reasons, including: Right-sided heart failure —when the right side of the heart is unable to pump efficiently, leading to increased pressure on blood vessels and forcing fluid from the blood vessels into the abdomen. Liver disease —liver dysfunction can cause a decrease in the production of albumin, a protein found in the bloodstream. Intestinal parasites —cause protein loss from the blood through the GI tract, which is another cause of fluid moving into the abdominal cavity. Nephrotic syndrome —an inflammation of the kidneys, causing loss of protein from the blood so that fluid in the kidneys’ inflamed blood vessels moves into the abdomen. Nephrotic syndrome itself can be caused by kidney infection, kidney cancer, or immune-mediated diseases that cause the body’s immune cells to attack and damage healthy kidney cells. Internal trauma —due to falls from high places or being hit by a car. Blood vessel rupture can lead to blood leaking into the abdomen, and bladder rupture can lead to urine leaking into the abdomen. Bladder rupture —due to blockage from stones or blood clots. Enlarged liver or spleen —may put pressure on lymph nodes and lymph vessels in the abdomen, preventing fluid from draining from the abdomen. Peritonitis —inflammation of the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) due to infection leads to ascites as the cells lining the abdomen become inflamed and produce too much fluid. Cancer —such as carcinomatosis (carcinoma throughout the abdomen) can cause fluid accumulation in the abdomen by irritating the peritoneum in a similar manner as peritonitis, with cells producing excess fluid. In addition to the clinical signs described above, veterinarians use several tests to diagnose ascites. Imaging methods such as X-ray and ultrasound are the most common diagnostic tests used to look for fluid in the abdomen, and imaging also allows evaluation of organs such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder, intestines, and heart to help identify the cause. If imaging is not conclusive, other diagnostic tests such as a blood chemistry panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, and stool examination are often required to determine the cause of ascites. The veterinarian may also collect a sample of the abdominal fluid to determine its composition, looking for components like blood, bacteria, protein, or cancerous cells. Treatment of ascites in cats depends upon the cause. In some cases, the underlying cause may not be correctable, so treatment may involve surgery to place a catheter in the abdomen to allow fluid to drain. Fluid that builds up slowly may only require periodic draining while your cat is sedated. Surgical correction to prevent further fluid buildup may be necessary in cases of tumors, hemorrhage from trauma, bladder rupture from injury, or urinary blockage. In other instances such as heart failure or liver disease, medications specific to the condition may be prescribed to reduce fluid accumulation in the abdomen. Carcinomatosis or other cancers that have spread throughout the body may need to be treated with chemotherapy rather than surgery. Bacterial causes of ascites such as peritonitis and sepsis need to be treated with antibiotics. Although cats with abdominal fluid caused by conditions such as heart failure, liver disease, or sepsis may not be stable enough to safely undergo surgical procedures, medical management is typically the best form of treatment. The timeline for recovery, overall prognosis, and chances of ascites recurring also depends on the underlying cause. Medications and low-sodium diets can help slow the rate of accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, but these therapies may not prevent ascites from recurring. Since ascites can be complicated to manage in cases of chronic or severe disease, it is crucial to take cats suspected of having fluid in the abdomen to a veterinarian or animal hospital as soon as possible. The cat can be given the best chance of comfort and healing as the ascites is being addressed by following the veterinarian’s instructions for treatment and management, including rechecks to assess progress.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/aspiration-pneumonia-cats,"Aspiration Pneumonia in Cats: Signs, Causes, and Treatment","iStock/GoodLifeStudio Aspiration pneumonia in cats is an uncommon, specific type of pneumonia (infection of the lungs) that can develop after a cat accidentally aspirates (inhales) foreign material into the lungs such as food, vomit, fluid (saliva), or even liquid medication. When foreign material accidentally enters the lungs, it causes irritation, inflammation, and infection of the lungs. If your cat is sick with coughing, abnormal breathing, and nasal discharge, your vet may suspect your cat could have aspiration pneumonia. Your vet will perform an exam and tests (chest X-rays and bloodwork) to determine why your cat is sick and the best treatment. The lungs function the same in cats as they do in humans; they remove used air (carbon dioxide) and supply the body with fresh oxygen in a process called ventilation. The lungs also transfer oxygen directly into the bloodstream to nourish tissues. Pneumonia occurs when the transfer of oxygen is disrupted. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when a cat accidentally breathes in a foreign substance, such as vomit , that interferes with oxygen transfer. Lack of oxygen for any reason can very quickly progress to severe illness, so if a cat shows any symptoms of aspiration pneumonia, it is important to take them to a veterinarian immediately. Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia in cats can occur quickly or develop slowly. The progression of symptoms will greatly depend on the severity of the aspiration. Some of the signs and symptoms include: Heavy breathing Increased heart rate Lack of appetite Green or yellow nasal discharge Fever Coughing Lethargy Respiratory distress Open-mouth breathing Aspiration pneumonia is most commonly caused by accidentally inhaling vomit or contents from the stomach. Stomach acid can cause inflammation in the airways and often contains bacteria, which can lead to infection in the lung tissue, which then results in pneumonia. Other risks or health issues that can cause aspiration pneumonia include: Throat or esophageal disorders ( megaesophagus) Anesthesia A cat under anesthesia has decreased swallowing and coughing reflexes , which can cause a cat to aspirate excess saliva or vomit. Muscle disorders ( myasthenia gravis ) Seizures (decreases the swallowing reflex) Oral cavity defects (such as cleft palate ) A history of vomiting, one or more of the clinical signs listed above, and a physical exam may lead your veterinarian to suspect aspiration pneumonia. Your cat’s breathing may also sound harsh when your veterinarian listens to their lungs. Tests your veterinarian may recommend include: Radiographs (X-rays) of the chest are the primary tool in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia; X-rays will give your veterinarian a picture of how the lungs are functioning. Depending on the severity of your cat’s symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend additional testing. A chemistry/complete blood count is a blood test that checks red and white blood cell levels, glucose levels, electrolytes, and organ function. This may be done in the hospital but may also need to be sent out to a laboratory. Results in cats with aspiration pneumonia will often show elevated levels of white blood cells and low red blood cell counts. An upper respiratory panel is a specialized test in which a swab is taken of the upper airway to test for viruses and bacteria. A culture may be taken from your cat’s trachea and/or nasal passage to determine what kind of bacteria is present and which antibiotics would be best to treat the infection. Treatment will generally consist of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Depending on the severity of your cat’s pneumonia, your vet might prescribe one of these antibiotics, sometimes two medications in certain situations , including: Doxycycline Clavamox (amoxicillin-clavulanate) Clindamycin Baytril (enrofloxacin) Additional treatments may include: Supportive care like intravenous (IV) fluid therapy Supplemental nutrition therapy, potentially through a feeding tube Nebulization to keep the airways moist, and supplemental oxygen Antifungals or other medications if other causes are suspected Your cat’s prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms, their response to treatment, and the initial cause of the aspiration pneumonia. When medical attention is prompt, most cats recover well. Most cats with aspiration pneumonia will require at least some time in the hospital, and many will require supplemental oxygen. Hospitalization may be 1–3 days or more depending on their case. Antibiotics are likely to be prescribed to your cat for at least two weeks or possibly longer. Your vet will recheck your cat in 10–14 days to determine if the treatment is working for your cat, or to adjust the treatment plan as needed. Most cats do not have any lingering issues once they have fully recovered from aspiration pneumonia. Certain cats with underlying issues may be susceptible to recurrence of aspiration pneumonia. Yes. With prompt and adequate medical treatment, most cats diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia recover completely. Aspiration pneumonia caused by the breathing in of vomit/stomach contents can cause symptoms in cats 1-18 days after the event. The mainstay of treatment of aspiration pneumonia is antibiotics. Additional treatments like intravenous fluid therapy, nutrition supplements, oxygen therapy or nebulization may be required. Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia may include coughing, an increased breathing rate, breathing with the mouth open, or fever. Levy N, Ballenger E, Koenigshof A.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_aspirin_tox,Aspirin Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Image via iStock.com/MilanEXPO Updated on February 25, 2019 Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, has been found to have beneficial effects for some animals. It has been used for conditions related to blood clotting and inflammation, and for its analgesic (pain-relieving) properties. However, aspirin for cats can actually be toxic. Aspirin should only be given to cats under strict veterinary supervision. On its own, aspirin can be toxic to cats. In combination with other medications, the effects of aspirin can be more rapid. Once ingested, aspirin forms salicylic acid, which is then distributed throughout the body. Aspirin toxicity is a particular concern in cats because they lack the enzyme critical for metabolizing salicylic acid properly. Cat owners must follow their veterinarian's orders strictly if cat aspirin is prescribed for any reason. The progression of symptoms can occur quickly. Frequently, one of the first noticeable signs is loss of appetite. Other signs of aspirin toxicity in cats include vomiting and diarrhea, brought on by ulceration in the stomach and small intestines. The vomit or diarrhea may have fresh blood (red) or digested blood (dark brown to black) in it. The central nervous system may also be affected, causing your cat to have trouble walking, appear weak and uncoordinated, or even collapse. Loss of consciousness and sudden death can also occur. Even dosed at the appropriate amount, aspirin for cats can produce these symptoms, therefore it is imperative for you to monitor your cat for any digestive problems or changes in behavior when giving aspirin that is prescribed by a veterinarian. If a significant amount of aspirin is ingested, emergency medical treatment will be necessary. If you know, or even suspect that your cat has ingested aspirin, and your cat is showing apparent symptoms of toxicity, contact an emergency veterinarian immediately. Diagnostic tests should focus on determining the severity of the toxicity. A blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis. Often an affected cat will be anemic (low red blood cell volume) with electrolyte abnormalities, in addition to showing a reduction in the blood's ability to clot properly. Aspirin reduces blood flow to the kidneys, which can cause or worsen existing kidney disease . Cats treated within 12 hours of ingestion, and who are presenting limited signs of distress, can have the concentration of aspirin in the body decreased through a prescribed treatment of decontamination. The sooner this care begins, the better. Your veterinarian may recommend that you decrease the amount of aspirin in the body by inducing vomiting at home before coming to the clinic, or the vomiting may be induced in the clinic. By inducing vomiting, or pumping the stomach (gastric lavage), your veterinarian will be able to remove as much aspirin as possible, which will help with lowering the chances of permanent injury. Activated charcoal may be given after vomiting to absorb some of the remaining aspirin. Depending on your cat's status, fluids and other supportive treatments may be necessary. Hospitalization and repeated blood analysis will often be standard until your cat is stable. Prescription pet medications to encourage healing, or to protect the gastrointestinal lining, are also generally prescribed both in the clinic and for a period of time after returning home. Aspirin for cats has several clinical uses. It can be prescribed as a pain reliever, an anti-inflammatory and an anti-blood clotting agent. It can also be used for lowering an abnormal body temperature. Regardless of why your cat is being prescribed aspirin, it is important to follow your veterinarian’s directions precisely. This includes the type of tablet because certain kinds of coating may increase the risk of toxicity in your cat. Reducing or discontinuing the aspirin dosage may be necessary if your pet is showing a susceptibility to toxicity. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/immune/autoimmune-disease-in-cats,Autoimmune Disease in Cats: Types and Symptoms To Watch Out For,"EyeEm Mobile GmbH/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Autoimmune diseases in cats are a group of conditions that result from a dysregulated immune system (one that’s not working properly). There are various types of autoimmune diseases, each with unique symptoms that pet parents should be aware of. The earlier an affected cat gets veterinary treatment, the greater likelihood the cat will have a positive outcome. Autoimmune diseases in cats occur when a feline’s immune system becomes dysregulated and does not function normally. This means that the cat’s own immune system mistakenly sees its own body’s cells as foreign and begins attacking and destroying them. Cats with autoimmune diseases need long-term treatment to manage their conditions and maintain a good quality of life. Autoimmune diseases can become medical emergencies if symptoms become severe, such as if the cat is having difficulty breathing , is extremely lethargic , or is not eating . If you notice any concerning symptoms in your cat, bring them to a veterinarian immediately. The most common types include the following: Pemphigus foliaceus . This disease occurs when the immune system attacks a cat’s own skin cells. This leads to painful blisters and open wounds on the skin, specifically on the paw pads and face. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia . This disease occurs when a cat’s immune system attacks and destroys its own red blood cells. Without enough red blood cells, the cat’s organs and tissues don’t get enough oxygen to work properly. Glomerulonephritis . This disease occurs after the immune system attacks part of the kidney that filters out waste from the cat’s blood, and it can ultimately lead to kidney failure . Anterior uveitis . When a cat’s immune system attacks the front part of the eye, including the iris and ciliary body, a cat’s eye can become severely inflamed (swollen) and have vision problems. Inflammatory bowel disease . Cells within the intestines are attacked and destroyed by the cat’s immune system, which leads to thickened intestines due to severe inflammation. There are several symptoms of autoimmune disease in cats, each specific to the type of illness affecting the pet. Many cats with autoimmune diseases have lethargy, decreased appetite, and enlarged lymph nodes . Other potential symptoms cats may have include the following: Pemphigus foliaceus Open sores and blisters on skin Skin crusting Hair loss Painful nail beds Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia Pale gums Weakness Yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin ( jaundice ) Increased heart rate Increased breathing rate Glomerulonephritis Increased thirst Increased urination Weight loss Vomiting Anterior uveitis Eye pain Squinting Reddened sclera (white part of the eye) Light sensitivity Frequent blinking Cloudy eyes Eye discharge Inflammatory bowel disease Diarrhea Constipation Vomiting Weight loss Painful abdomen Bloating and gas While we don’t know the exact reason for autoimmune disease in cats, there are several possible causes that may contribute. These include: Genetics Toxin or chemical exposure Bacterial or viral infections, such as feline leukemia virus Stress Side effects of medications Food allergies Some purebred cats, such as Persians and Himalayans , are predisposed to developing autoimmune conditions, likely due to genetics. While both sexes can be affected, many of the autoimmune conditions are more likely to occur in females. Middle-aged cats are also at an increased risk compared to other age groups. If you notice any symptoms of autoimmune disease in cats, it’s important to bring your pet to a veterinarian for a checkup . The veterinarian will ask when the symptoms first began, what your cat’s diet is, and their medical and vaccination history. To figure out the underlying cause for the symptoms, the veterinarian may do the following tests: Physical exam : A veterinarian does a thorough head-to-toe check of the cat’s overall health, noting any abnormalities. Blood work : A small sample of blood is taken to check overall health, including blood cell counts, organ function, and electrolytes. Skin cytology : The cat’s skin cells—specifically areas of crusting or with open sores—are gently scraped, placed onto a glass slide, stained, and viewed under the microscope to find abnormalities. Skin biopsy : A small piece of the cat’s skin is removed and sent to a special laboratory for a definitive diagnosis of disease. This can be done using local anesthesia or sedation. Urinalysis : A small sample of the cat’s urine is checked for abnormalities that could show disease, such as abnormal concentration, protein loss, and blood. Ophthalmic exam : This exam thoroughly checks the cat’s eyes using special tools, such as an ophthalmoscope. The veterinarian will also check the eye pressures using a tonometer and stain the eyes with fluorescein to check for ulcers. Imaging : Cats who have gastrointestinal symptoms may benefit from an abdominal ultrasound or X-rays to find abnormalities, such as thickened intestines. A small sample (biopsy) of intestine can be collected while the cat is sedated for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment for autoimmune diseases in cats consists of long-term medication management to control the symptoms. The most common treatments include the following: Immunosuppressants, such as Atopica Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone Blood transfusions Antibiotics, such as Clavamox , for secondary bacterial infections Topical ointments, such as Animax Additional medications may be prescribed by your veterinarian for your cat’s specific condition. Autoimmune diseases in cats are not curable and require long-term treatment to successfully manage symptoms. Cats with severe illness need hospitalization and supportive care for a few days until they are stable enough to continue recovery at home. The exact length of time for this varies depending on symptoms and how well a cat responds to treatment. While pets are recovering, it’s important to provide them a quiet and private space to reduce overall stress levels. Providing a cozy cat bed , like this Best Friends bed , can encourage rest and a quicker recovery. Cats with autoimmune diseases need regular and frequent follow-up care with their veterinarian to manage their condition and make sure they stay stable. Ensure you always keep any scheduled follow-up appointments with your veterinarian and give any medications at home exactly as prescribed. Always contact your veterinarian with any new symptoms or concerns. Unfortunately, most autoimmune diseases in cats can’t be prevented. However, pet parents can encourage their cat’s overall health through regular wellness care, routine vaccinations, and feeding a complete and balanced diet. Ensuring cats aren’t exposed to environmental toxins and chemicals may reduce their risk; decreasing stress in their environment overall might also help. While there are many autoimmune diseases in cats, pemphigus foliaceus is the most seen. A cat can recover from autoimmune disease through the right treatment and long-term management; however, autoimmune diseases are not curable. Signs related to autoimmune diseases vary, but cats commonly have decreased appetite, lethargy, and weight loss. Cats with autoimmune diseases may need special diets prescribed by a veterinarian. It’s important to follow your veterinarian’s guidance to know what to feed your cat based on their unique needs and condition.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_babesiosis,Babesiosis in Cats,"Babesiosis, previously called piroplasmosis, is a blood-borne parasite transmitted through the bite of a tick. It can affect a wide variety of animals, including humans. Specifically, Babesia felis is the protozoan parasite that affects cats. Though it can often have deadly consequences, this disease is fortunately not as common in the United States (though it is more prevalent where ticks are in abundance). It is seen more predominately in Southern Africa and other countries. The parasite is ingested by a tick during its feeding stage and replicates within it. If it is inside a female carrying eggs, it will go on to affect the eggs. When the tick latches on and bites the cat, it will pour out (regurgitate) digestive enzymes to prevent the cat’s blood from clotting so it can continue feeding. It is during this regurgitation process that the disease is transmitted to the cat. Once inside the cat’s bloodstream, the parasites attach to the red blood cells, replicate, and later rupture the cells. They then continue to infect other cells. Anemia (blood loss) usually develops within a few weeks, which can manifest as a lack of energy and appetite, and other serious and life-threatening complications. Of the cases reported, most infections seem to occur in younger cats. There doesn’t seem to be any specific breed or gender that is affected more than another. Tick-borne diseases are usually noticed within a few weeks after the original tick bite. You may notice your cat experiencing the following: Lethargy Lack of appetite Anemia and secondary bruising, which may be noticed as pale gums, bloody stool, and/or a bloody nose Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, or gums) Fever (not as commonly reported) In addition to the above symptoms, you may notice irritation, redness, and itching around the bite site. Because babesiosis is transmitted through tick bites, be sure to check your cat thoroughly for ticks that are visible to the naked eye; usually the size of a tack or smaller, often darker in color, and have several pairs of legs. The most common areas ticks are found on a cat include the head, ears, neck, feet, and rear. Cats acquire babesiosis most frequently through tick bites. Babesiosis has been found in multiple vertebrate species, including humans. Fortunately, it is not a zoonotic disease, meaning you cannot acquire the disease from your cat. Because it is a blood-borne parasite, it can be transmitted to other cats through bites, scratches, and even blood transfusions. Your veterinarian will conduct a physical exam and review the type and consistency of tick preventive given, if any. It is crucial to communicate to your veterinarian any previous tick bites and/or tick sightings in the environment, and discuss any recent travel outside of the United States, prior blood transfusions, and any recent bite wounds. Following this, your vet may also recommend the following: Bloodwork (specifically a complete blood cell count), urine testing, and X-rays to assess your cat’s overall condition and to rule out other possibilities. Microscopic review of a blood smear, often done by a veterinary clinical pathologist, to look for the pear-shaped organisms seen within the blood cells themselves. PCR or antibody testing aimed at detecting the organism’s DNA. Analysis of the tick itself, if recovered and brought in. Primaquine phosphate, an anti-malarial drug, has been reported to be effective for the treatment of babesiosis. Antiprotozoal medications, such as imidocarb dipropionate, have also been used. Depending on the severity of the infection and clinical signs noted, supportive care may be needed. This may include pain medications, blood transfusions, IV fluids, and appetite stimulants. If your cat requires a blood transfusion, it is extremely important to check its blood type first. Unfortunately, there is not a babesiosis vaccine approved for use on cats at this time. The timeline of recovery for a cat is dependent on the case. It often takes several doses of the medication—given multiple weeks apart— for full recovery to take place. PCR testing is often recommended as a follow-up to figure out the level and degree of infection and carrier status (if there was no previous infection). Most cats, if treated early during infection, will live normal and healthy lives. If left untreated, your cat can experience complications, usually related to the anemia, but other complications can develop such as kidney disease, respiratory distress, and liver issues. For cats who recover, even though they can often remain asymptomatic, they will remain carriers of the disease for life, which means there may need to be some continual monitoring and considerations as other cats could become infected. Preventing ticks on your cat is relatively effortless. There are many available and cost-effective products on the market that can be used to prevent fleas and ticks on cats . Be sure to partner with your veterinarian to find the product most suitable for you and your pet. Most products take several hours before they start killing and repelling ticks, so be mindful when planning outdoor activities. Ticks have been found throughout the United States and abroad, and it is recommended that you provide year-round protection and perform frequent, thorough checks for ticks on your cat.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_actinomycosis,Bacterial Infection (Actinomycosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial This infectious disease is caused by a gram positive, pleomorphic (can change shape somewhat between a rod and coccus), rod-shaped bacteria of the genus Actinomyces , most commonly the A. viscosus species. Able to survive with little (microaerophilic) or no oxygen (anaerobic), Actinomyces is rarely found as the single bacterial agent in a lesion. It more often a component of a polymicrobial infection with several bacteria present. In fact, there may even be synergism between Actinomyces and other organisms. Actinomycosis is thought to occur as an opportunistic infection; i.e., Actinomyces spp. is a normal inhabitant of the cat's mouths, but cuts, scrapes, or bite wounds in the mucosa or skin can cause an imbalance in the bacterial microenvironment. Other risk factors include periodontal disease and immunosuppressive disorders. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel. X-rays of cats with actinomycosis will typically demonstrate periosteal (outer layer of bone) new bone production, reactive osteosclerosis (hardening of bone), and osteolysis (dissolution of bone). For a more definitive diagnosis your veterinarian will submit a specimen of pus or osteolytic bone fragments for culturing. Gram staining, cytology, and acid-fast staining may also be employed. The cat's abscesses will be drained and lavaged for several days. In some cases, a penrose drain will be utilized, whereby a soft rubber tube is placed in the affected area to prevent fluid buildup. Depending on the severity of the infection, your veterinarian may also need to debride (cut open and/or remove tissue) or remove bone, which will require surgery. Many veterinarians recommend the administration of antibiotics for a minimum of three to four months after the resolution of all signs. This will assist in fighting against other commonly associated microbes. Observe the affected area for signs of infection and contact a veterinarian if the following signs are noted: itching, swelling, redness and/or draining. Otherwise, your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments to monitor your pet closely for recurrence. Redevelopment of infection at the initial site should be expected in about half of the cases. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_bordetellosis,Bacterial Infection (B. bronchiseptica) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Bordetellosis is a contagious bacterial disease of cats that primarily causes upper respiratory tract abnormalities. Easily spread in kennels, bordetellosis is most severe in young kittens (less than six weeks old) and in kittens living in less than ideal hygienic conditions. However, any cat with a pre-existing airway disease (e.g., feline herpesvirus and calicivirus infections) is susceptible to Bordetellosis, no matter how old it is. Carrier cats can seem healthy or have even mild symptoms, but others many have serious complications. Common symptoms associated with Bordetellosis many display untoward symptoms such as: This disease is caused by the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica , a small, aerobic gram-negative (stains purple on slides) coccobacillus . You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. If severe pneumonia is present, the complete blood count will show an abnormally elevated number of neutrophils with a “left shift,” or an increase in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils. Swab specimens taken from the back of the cat's throat (oropharynx) can also be used to confirm a B. bronchiseptica infection. To identify the sensitivity of the bacteria, meanwhile, an endotracheal wash or tracheobronchial lavage via bronchoscopy can be performed. This, too, will assist the veterinarian in developing an effective treatment plan. Cats with Bordetellosis should be allowed to rest comfortable in a quiet place, away from other pets and active children, for at least two to three weeks or until their lungs appear normal in X-Rays -- especially those that have developed pneumonia. In addition, antimicrobial medication and fluid therapy will be administered. Cats with uncomplicated infections should begin to recover within two weeks. If the cat does not improve, contact your veterinarian to reevaluate your pet. Cats with severe infections, on the other hand, may require regular follow-up examinations to assess its lungs. In addition, cats with bordetellosis may shed the bacteria for at least 19 weeks after initial infection, so be sure to isolate your animal from other cats. The best way to prevent this type of infection is to vaccinate your cat against Bordetella . Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_campylobacteriosis,Bacterial Infection (Campylobacteriosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Campylobacteriosis is not commonly found in cats, but when it does occur, it is most likely to affect kittens younger than six months old. The bacteria which causes the disease can typically be found in the gut (gastrointestinal tract) of most healthy mammals, and will remain harmless for most. Up to 45 percent of stray cats carry the campylobacter bacteria. The bacterium is shed through the feces, where other animals may come into contact with it, contracting the bacteria into their own bodies. Because of this, humans can also contract the disease if they do not practice proper hygiene after coming into contact with an infected animal. There are several known causes, but the most common way that a cat comes into contact with campylobacter bacteria is from kennels, which may allow animals to come into direct contact with contaminated feces. Ingestion of contaminated food or water is another mode of transmission. In addition, younger animals are at a greater risk for contracting the disease because of their underdeveloped immune systems and natural tendency to explore their environments. A fecal culture is the most common diagnostic procedure. After 48 hours, your veterinarian will examine the culture to look for leukocytes (fecal white blood cells) in the stool, the presence of which is an indication of infection; leukocytes may also be found in your cat's gastrointestinal tract, confirming the presence of campylobacter in the body. complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. For mild cases, outpatient treatment is generally recommended. Meanwhile, if your cat has a severe case of campylobacteriosis it will require close monitoring to prevent further complications. Your veterinarian may recommend isolating your cat so that it is not infectious to others, and so that it can recover fully. Administering an oral fluid therapy to treat or prevent dehydration, as well as administration of antibiotics, will be part of the plan for eradicating the infection. In more severe cases, a plasma transfusion may also be necessary. While your cat is under treatment and recovering, it is important that you keep it hydrated and watch for any signs of a worsening condition. You will also need to revisit your veterinarian for follow-up treatments to ensure that the bacteria have been entirely removed. Cleaning your cat's living and eating areas, and routinely disinfecting its water and food bowls are good ways to prevent this type of bacterial infection.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_leptospirosis,Bacterial Infection (Leptospirosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Leptospirosis is an infection of bacterial spirochetes, which cats acquire when subspecies of the Leptospira interrogans penetrate the skin and spread through the body by way of the bloodstream. Two of of the most commonly seen members of this subspecies are the L. grippotyphosa and L. Pomona bacteria. Spirochetes are spiral or corkscrew-shaped bacteria which infiltrate the system by burrowing into the skin. Leptospires spread throughout the entire body, reproducing in the liver, kidneys, central nervous system, eyes, and reproductive system. Soon after the initial infection, fever and bacterial infection of the blood develop, but these symptoms soon resolve with the reactive increase of antibodies, which clear the spirochetes from most of the system. The extent to which this bacteria affects the organs will depend on your cat's immune system and its ability to eradicate the infection fully. Even then, Leptospira spirochetes can remain in the kidneys and continue to reproduce there. Infection of the liver or kidneys can be fatal when the infection progresses, leading to severe organ damage. Young cats with less developed immune systems are at heightened risk for severe complications, as well as cats with already compromised immune systems. The Leptospira spirochete bacteria is zoonotic, meaning that it can be transmitted from an infected animal to humans and other animals. Children are most at risk of acquiring this parasitic bacteria from an infected pet. The Leptospira spirochete infection occurs mainly in subtropical, tropical, and wet environments. Leptospira spirochetes are most prevalent in marshy/muddy areas with stagnant surface water. Heavily irrigated pastures are also common sources of infection. The infection rate for domestic pets has been increasing in the U.S. And Canada, with infections occurring most commonly in the fall season. Cats typically come into contact with the leptospira bacteria in infected soil or mud, from drinking or being in contaminated water, or from coming into contact with urine from an infected animal. This last method of contact might take place in the wild. Cats that live near wooded areas, or cats that live on or near farms are at a higher risk of contracting the bacteria. Also at increased risk are cats that have spent time around other animals, as in kennels. Otherwise, because most cat breeds do not spend a lot of time near water, infection of the Leptospira spirochete is rare in cats. Because leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, your veterinarian will be especially cautious when handling your cat, and will strongly advise you to do the same. Protective latex gloves must be worn at all times, and all body fluids will be treated as biologically hazardous materials. Urine, semen, post-abortion or birth discharge, vomit, and any fluid that leaves the body will need to be handled with extreme caution. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, recent activities, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what stage of infection your cat is experiencing, and which organs are being most affected. Your veterinarian will then order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, an electrolyte panel, and a fluorescent antibody urine test. Urine and blood cultures will also be ordered for examining the prevalence of the bacteria. A microscopic agglutination test, or titer test, will be performed to measure your cat's immune response to the infection by measuring the presence of antibodies in the bloodstream. This will help to definitively identify Leptospira spirochetes and the level of systemic infection that is occurring. Your cat will need to be hospitalized if it is severely ill from this infection. Fluid therapy will be the primary treatment for reversing any effects of dehydration. If your cat has been vomiting, an anti-vomiting drug, called an antiemetic, may be administered, and a gastric tube can be used to give nourishment if your cat's ability to eat or keep food down is being hindered by the illness. A blood transfusion may also be necessary if your cat has been severely hemorrhaging. Antibiotics will be prescribed by your veterinarian for a course of at least four weeks, with the type of antibiotic dependent on the stage of infection. Penicillins can be used for initial infections, but they are not effective for eliminating the bacteria once it has reached the carrier stage. Tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, or similar antibiotics will be prescribed for the carrier stage, since they are better distributed into the bone tissue. Some antibiotics can have side effects that appear serious, especially those drugs that go deeper into the system to eliminate infection. Be sure to read all of the warnings that come with the prescription, and talk to your veterinarian about adverse indications you will need to watch for. Prognosis for recovery is generally positive, barring severe organ damage. A vaccination for the prevention of the leptospirosis infection is available in some areas. Your veterinarian can advise you on the availability and usefulness of this vaccine. Make sure to inspect kennels before placing your cat in one – the kennel should be kept very clean, and should be free of rodents (look for rodent droppings). Urine from an infected animal should not come into contact with any other animals, or people. Animals that are kept in close quarters are going to be in contact with other animals' urine, even under the best circumstances, so cleanliness needs to be the utmost consideration when choosing your kennel. Activity should be restricted to cage rest while your cat recovers from the physical trauma of this infection. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, transmissible to humans, and other animals via urine, semen, and post-abortion discharge. While your pet is in the process of being treated, you will need to keep it isolated from children and other pets, and you will need to wear protective latex gloves when handling your pet in any way, or when handling fluid or waste products from your pet. Areas where your pet has urinated, vomited, or has possibly left any other type of fluid should be cleaned and disinfected thoroughly with iodine-based disinfectants or bleach solutions. Gloves should be worn during the cleaning process and disposed of properly afterwards. Finally, if you do have other pets or children in the home, they may have been infected with the leptospira bacteria and are not yet showing symptoms. It may be worthwhile to have them (and yourself) tested for the presence of the bacteria. It is also important to keep in mind that leptospires may continue to be shed through the urine for several weeks after treatment and apparent recovery from the infection. Appropriate handling practices are the best way to prevent the spread of infection or reinfection. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/c_ct_metritis,Bacterial Infection (Metritis) of the Uterus in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Metritis, a uterine infection that usually occurs within a week after a cat gives birth, is symptomized by an inflammation of the endometrium (lining) of the uterus due to a bacterial infection. It can also develop after a natural or medical abortion, miscarriage, or after a non-sterile artificial insemination. The bacteria that are most often responsible for infection of the uterus are gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli, which often spreads into the blood, causing a blood infection. The infection may lead to sterility, and if left untreated, septic shock, a lethal condition, may follow. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. These tests will help your veterinarian to determine whether the bacterial infection has spread to the bloodstream, where the infection might have originated, and how dehydrated your cat is. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Diagnostic tools, like radiograph and ultrasound imaging, will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the interior of the uterus for any retained fetuses or birth matter, excess fluid accumulation, and/or abnormal amounts of abdominal fluid production due to uterine rupture. A sample of the vaginal discharge will also be taken for cytologic (microscopic) examination. A culture of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that lives with oxygen, or without oxygen, respectively) will be used for identifying the bacterial populations present in the blood, and a sensitivity of the isolated bacteria will be performed so that the most appropriate antibiotic treatments can be prescribed. Your cat will need to be hospitalized for fluid therapy, and for correction and stabilization of any electrolyte imbalances. If the infection has reached sepsis, your cat will also be treated for shock. Your cat will also need to be placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics until the bacterial culture and sensitivity results return from the lab; then, depending on the results, your veterinarian may switch your pet to the antibiotic best suited for eliminating the bacteria that are causing the infection. If the metritis is not in an advanced stage, your cat will most likely respond to medical treatment. However, medical treatment does not always prevent the infection from progressing to a generalized abdominal infection and ruptured uterus. If future breeding is not planned, having your cat spayed is the treatment of choice. This solution is especially appropriate when retained fetuses or placentas are present in the uterus, when the uterus has ruptured, or when it is severely infected. Patients suffering from a long-term infection that is not responding to medical treatment may improve with a surgical cleaning of the uterus. If your cat is nursing and has been diagnosed with a bacterial blood infection, it will be better to hand-raise her kittens so that transmission of the infection through her milk can be prevented. This can also prevent possible harm to the kittens from exposure to the prescribed antibiotics in their mother's bloodstream. Keep in mind that even without spaying, animals that have been treated for a uterine infection have a chance of becoming less fertile, or even infertile, making future breeding difficult or impossible.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_mycoplasmosis,"Bacterial Infection (Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Acoleplasma) in Cats","PetMD Editorial Mycoplasma, acholeplasma, and t-mycoplasma or ureaplasma are three types of a class of anaerobic bacterial parasitic microorganisms that act as infectious agents to the body. Mycoplasmosis is the general medical name given to a disease caused by one of these agents. These bacteria are capable of living and growing even without the presence of oxygen (anaerobic), and are able to self produce. Mycoplasma lack a true cell wall, making them capable of assuming a variety of shapes, and capable of spreading into different systems throughout the body, from the respiratory tract, where they can cause pneumonia, to the urinary tract, where they can result in various forms of diseased conditions. These bacteria are believed to be the smallest organisms capable of growing independently, and they remain ubiquitous in nature; they are found in nearly every environment, causing disease not only in animals, but also in people, plants, and insects. Symptoms of mycoplasmosis includes simultaneous inflammation of several joints (known as polyarthritis ), such as the knees, ankles, hips, or shoulders, and inflammation of tendon sheaths. Long-term lameness, difficulty moving, fever, and general signs of discomfort are some of the typical signs. Other signs may include squinting or spasmodic blinking, fluid-buildup in the eyes, reddened eyes, discharge from the eyes, or conjunctivitis , a condition in which the moist tissue of the eye becomes inflamed. Respiratory symptoms are usually mild, with sneezing being the main complaint. In cats, further signs related to the site of infection may include long term abscesses on the surface of the body/skin. Infections in the respiratory system, or urinary and genital tract infections, are also common. Feline pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, are some of the conditions that may be present. Because of the genital to reproductive system proximity of this bacterial parasite, pregnancy related problems are a common finding. Weak newborns, stillbirths, early death of newborns, or death while in embryo are some of the more severe repercussions. Mycoplasmosis is caused by exposure to a number of commonplace bacteria that can be found throughout the environment. Some of the bacteria that cause mycoplasmosis in cats include M. felis , M. gateae , and M. feliminutum . Factors that may increase the risk of developing mycoplasmosis include an immunodeficiency disorder that prevents the immune system from functioning properly, as well as other issues that may affect the immune system, such as tumors. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will also be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. There are various diagnostic procedures that may be undertaken if the symptoms of mycoplasmosis are present. An analysis of the fluid secreted into the prostate can reveal if normal bacterial cultures are present. The presence of mycoplasmosis will be concurrent with inflammatory cells. If polyarthritis is suspected, an analysis of the synovial fluid, the fluid found in the cavities of certain joints (e.g., knees, shoulders), may be useful. Increased levels of nondegenerative neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are usually found in this case. Mycoplasmosis is treated on an outpatient basis, meaning it does not require hospitalization and can be treated at home. Depending on the severity and localization of the condition, antibiotics may be prescribed in order to address the infection. Treatment at home generally must continue for an extended period of time. Your veterinarian can specifically prescribe the appropriate antibiotic treatment and specify the necessary length of treatment based on an examination of the symptoms. It is important to regularly administer any antibiotic treatment for the full period of time as advised by your veterinarian. Cats with healthy immune systems that are given proper treatment with antibiotics have a good prognosis and are expected to recover fully. There are no known vaccines available to prevent infection by the bacteria which cause mycoplasmosis, thus there is little that can be done to prevent infection. The bacteria causing mycoplasmosis may be killed by drying out (for example, via sunshine) as well as chemical disinfection. Your veterinarian can guide you in the selection of products that will work in your environment. General cleanliness and avoidance of extended exposure to moisture may be helpful.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_nocardiosis,Bacterial Infection (Nocardiosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Both dogs and cats may become exposed to the infectious, saphrophytic organism, which nourishes itself from dead or decaying matter in the soil. Also referred to as Nocardiosis, it is an uncommon infectious disease that affects several body systems, including the respiratory, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Typically, exposure occurs either through open wounds or via inhalation. Symptoms of nocardiosis are largely dependent on the site of infection. If, for example, it occurs in the pleural body cavity, which includes the lungs and surrounding membranes, symptoms can include emaciation, fever , and raspy, labored breathing ( dyspnea ). If it is a skin infection, symptoms can include the presence of chronic non-healing wounds and, if left untreated, draining lymph nodes. If the infection is not localized in one specific area of the body (also known as disseminated), the symptoms may include fever, weight loss , and lethargic behavior. The infectious organism is found in the soil and can enter the cat's body through open wounds or through the respiratory tract, when it inhales. Nocardia asteroides is the most common species affecting cats. Cats are also susceptible to Nocardia brasiliensis and Proactinomyces spp. Your veterinarian will analyze cells from the cat's thorax or abdomen to identify the causative organism. Other diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and urine analysis, are employed to rule out other potential causes, including fungal infections and tumors. Treatment for nocardiosis is largely dependent upon the site of infection and subsequent symptoms. If pleural effusion is apparent, hospitalization will be necessary to prevent dehydration. Surgical drainage of the fluid may even be required. Otherwise, long-term antibiotic therapy is vital for fighting off the infection. Because nocardiosis frequently affects the musculoskeletal and central nervous system, it is imperative that you carefully monitor the cat for fever, weight loss, seizures, breathing difficulties, and lameness for at least one year after therapy. General cleanliness and frequent disinfection of your cat's wounds or cuts may help prevent this type of infection, especially if your cat has a weakened immune system. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_streptococcal_infections,Bacterial Infection (Streptococcus) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Streptococcal infection, common in cats, refers to an infection with the Streptococcus bacteria. Kittens and older cats are most susceptible to developing this disease, as their immune systems are not fully developed or have declined. The condition described in this medical article is common in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Some of the common symptoms of this infection include: Age often determines the propensity for developing this bacterial infection. Both the oldest and youngest cats have less developed immune systems -- the youngest because of the lack of antibodies to fight infection, and the oldest because of a decline in antibodies and a weakened immune system. Some of the causes for infection are viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, often resulting from recent exposure through a wound or surgical procedure. Antibiotics and hydration will be part of the prescribed treatment. Good nursing care is important to help the cat recover from this bacterial infection. Rehydration is also important for restoring the body with fluid and flushing the system of the infection. Avoid environments overcrowded with other animals. Other than avoidance of contact with other animals, there are no known preventative measures for this bacterial infection. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_tyzzer_disease,Bacterial Infection (Tyzzer Disease) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Tyzzer disease is a life-threatening bacterial infection. It is caused by the bacterium Clostridium piliformis , which is thought to multiply in the intestines and once reaching the liver, causing severe damage. Young cats are at high risk of developing the disease. Due to the severity of the liver damage, some cats with Tyzzer disease may die within 24-48 hours. Some early signs of the disease include: The bacterium Clostridium piliformis . Your veterinarian will conduct a complete medical history and perform a physical examination on your cat. He or she will then use routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to assess the condition of your cat and severity of the disease. If your cat has Tyzzer disease, the biochemistry profile testing may reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, especially shortly before the cat's condition becomes dire. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for Tyzzer disease. Consult with your veterinarian if there is anything that can be done to alleviate your cat's pain.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/bacterial-skin-infections-pyoderma-cats,Bacterial Skin Infections (Pyoderma) in Cats,"A major function of the skin is to act as a protective barrier against infection. If this barrier is damaged and breached, bacteria can colonize and cause infection. Bacterial skin infections in cats may be referred to as pyoderma. Both phrases relate to disease of the skin caused by germs. In medical terminology, the prefix “pyo-” means “pus” and the suffix “-derma” refers to the “skin,” forming the definition “pus in the skin.” Bacterial infections of the skin may be caused by an overgrowth of bacteria that normally live on the skin (normal flora) or by bacteria temporarily or not normally found on the skin. Cats develop pyoderma less commonly than dogs do . If a skin infection is not treated appropriately, the infection can migrate deeper into tissues, causing worsening signs and further discomfort. Bacterial infections may be located on the surface of the cat’s skin, extend superficially into the outer layer of the skin (epidermis), or migrate into the deeper layers of the skin (dermis and subcutis). Surface : Infection rests on the surface of the skin and may include hot spots, skin fold irritation, and skin redness due to an overgrowth of bacteria. Superficial : The infection extends deeper than the skin’s surface into the epidermis and hair follicles. This is commonly caused by Staphylococcus bacteria. Deep : This type of infection occurs less commonly, but it is more harmful because it extends into the dermis and can lead to cellulitis or introduce bacteria into the blood. If infections are persistent and do not heal, there may be an underlying immune dysfunction such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or an atypical mycobacteria infection. Signs of bacterial skin infection in a cat may include: Excessive scale or dander, especially on the lower back near the tail Crusts Small, firm bumps on the skin (miliary dermatitis) Hair loss Redness Open sores or ulcers Blood and discharge from sores Skin odor Scratching, licking, or rubbing the skin (itchiness) Bacterial skin infection in cats can be caused by an underlying condition such as allergies , external parasites like fleas , Demodex , or feline chin acne . Areas on the cat’s body that are warm and trap moisture (skin folds) host the perfect conditions for bacteria that can lead to irritation and infection. Diseases affecting the cat’s immune system such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) can cause an overgrowth of bacteria since a cat’s natural defenses are suppressed. Injuries such as scratches or bite wounds that compromise the protective function of the skin can allow bacteria to colonize and cause infection, which may progress to an abscess . Endocrine disorders including hyperthyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing’s disease) can affect the skin, potentially leading to infection. Inadequate grooming can leave the skin greasy and dirty and cause matting of the hair, which can also irritate the skin. The most common bacterial strains include: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (usually found on the skin) Pasteurella multocida (commonly found in the cat’s mouth and saliva) Diagnosing a bacterial skin infection is based on the cat’s history, clinical signs, diagnostic testing, and ruling out other diseases and disorders. The following diagnostic options may be recommended: Skin cytology —Your vet may take samples from the skin lesions and observe them under a microscope to confirm presence or absence of bacteria or white blood cells Skin scraping —Skin scrapings are taken to look for mites. This is accomplished by scraping the cat’s skin with a sterile scalpel blade deep enough to cause irritation or some mild bleeding to ensure any mites are included in the sample (Demodex lives deep in the hair follicles) Wood’s lamp —Any yellow-green fluorescence observed by lamp may indicate a fungal infection, like ringworm Trichogram —Plucked hairs can be examined under a microscope to look for any fungal spores or mites Fungal culture —May also be taken to look for fungal growth to help diagnose the cat’s skin condition Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing —This will tell the veterinarian what type of bacteria is present and provide direction on the best medication(s) for treatment, especially if the infection is recurrent or does not heal Successful treatment of a bacterial skin infection is based on the results of the diagnostic testing. The most common bacterial skin infection in cats is caused by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius . The most effective systemic antibiotics for treating this type of infection include: Clindamycin Cephalexin C lavamox ® Trimethoprim sulfa Topical medications include shampoos, creams, gels, ointments, sprays, wipes, and mousses. These products can be effective for superficial or mild skin infections and the active ingredients can be effective in eliminating bacterial infections. Recommended products include: TrizCHLOR ® wipes Vetoquinol BPO-3™ Shampoo Douxo S3 PYO Antiseptic Antifungal Chlorhexidine Dog & Cat Shampoo Davis Benzoyl Peroxide Dog & Cat Creme Rinse Pet MD Antiseptic & Antifungal Medicated Spray Ethyl lactate (10%) Sodium hypochlorite (0.005%) Bacterial skin infections take time to heal, and directions from your veterinarian should be followed precisely. Give the antibiotics exactly as prescribed and make sure your cat finishes all of them. Antibiotics may need to be given daily for three or more weeks. Severe infections may need 8-12 weeks of antibiotic therapy to heal. Superficial infections may be treated until all clinical signs resolve, and then be continued for an extra 7-10 days. A recurrent or non-healing infection often has an underlying problem that has not been identified and is not being treated correctly. Other reasons an infection hasn’t healed include the antibiotics being stopped too early, the wrong medication being prescribed, or an incorrect dose being used. Cats with pyoderma may benefit from having their hair clipped, especially long-coated cats. This helps with grooming by removing hair that may trap bacteria, dirt, dead skin cells, and oil. Regular grooming is recommended to help prevent matting of the hair, and it also helps identify any issues before they become a big problem. Cats with a bacterial skin infection may have excessive dander and scale, crusts, red and irritated skin, open and draining wounds, pus, hair loss, bumpy skin, or itchiness. Yes, it is possible that some bacterial infections can be contagious to humans, especially for people who have a weakened immune system. One example is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The best way to prevent infection is to maintain hygiene by washing your hands with soap and warm water after interacting with your cat and after cleaning the litter box, and by covering any open wounds on your skin.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/bad-breath-cats,Bad Breath in Cats,"lopurice/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Is your cat’s breath unusually bad? The medical term for bad breath is halitosis, and it can be caused by several factors, such as dental disease , kidney disease , or diabetes . The most common cause is a buildup of bacteria on the surface of the teeth, leading to periodontal disease . Plaque is a sticky substance that is made up of saliva and leftover food particles. It sticks to the surface of your cat's teeth and gives bacteria a place to grow. Over time, that bacteria-laden plaque hardens into tartar, which can irritate the mouth leading to red swollen gums (gingivitis). It may also cause inflammation of the surrounding tissue like the inner surface of the cheeks, lips, tongue, and roof of the mouth, a condition called stomatitis . Besides causing stinky breath, it may be painful for the cat . Halitosis is a common condition in cats and is not considered a medical emergency. Symptoms of bad breath in cats may include: Smelly saliva Excessive drooling Red, sore gums Dark yellow, brown, or green material on the surface of the teeth Decreased appetite or difficulty chewing The most common cause of bad breath in cats is tartar buildup and the periodontal disease that follows when it gets underneath the gum line. The tartar that forms on teeth can hurt the surrounding tissues, like the gums and inner surfaces of the cheeks, lips, and roof of the mouth. An overgrowth of bad bacteria then occurs in the mouth, which leads to decay. Decaying tissue surrounding the teeth gives off a smelly sulfuric scent that contributes to bad breath. This can progress to rotten teeth and mouth pain. Other causes include: Getting things stuck in between the teeth or under the gum line, like string or food. Oral ulcers , whether from an underlying virus like feline calicivirus or uremic ulcers from kidney disease. Uncontrolled diabetes, which can create compounds called ketones that cause a sickly-sweet smelling breath. Mouth cancer , which can also lead to dead or decaying tissue. Any cat of any age or breed can have halitosis. Dental tartar and the resulting bad breath can affect all cats, but it is less common in very young cats who have not had time to build up much tartar. Feline juvenile gingivitis-periodontitis, where cats are affected by dental disease at an early age, is more commonly in Siamese , Maine Coon , and Somali breeds. Kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer are all more common in middle-aged to senior cats. If you notice bad breath in your cat, call your veterinarian. During the appointment, they will start with a thorough oral exam. If they are unable to check the entire mouth due to your cat’s stress level or pain, they may recommend sedation to help them see in the back of the mouth. Let your vet know if your cat is not eating well or if you are seeing them do any strange movements with their jaw or tongue. If your cat does not have any signs of dental disease as the primary cause of their bad breath, your vet may recommend more diagnostics, like blood work. Bad breath is treated by addressing the underlying cause. If the cause of your cat’s halitosis is dental disease, your veterinarian will clean the teeth and remove any that are rotten. The cleaning is done by putting your cat under anesthesia and using a special tool called an ultrasonic scaler to remove stubborn tartar and to clean around and under the gums. They will also polish the teeth to smooth any microscopic scratches on their surface. This helps to slow the buildup of future plaque and tartar. Antibiotics or pain medications may be prescribed. If other underlying diseases are found, they will be treated by your vet. Recovery following a dental procedure is typically smooth. If your cat had any teeth removed, they may be put on a soft food diet for 10 to 14 days while their gums are healing. This means feeding either canned food exclusively or softening dry food by watering it down and allowing it to soak for 10 minutes before feeding. If your cat had stitches following any teeth removals, you may see some pawing at the mouth if the stitching material is bothering them. For these cats, a recovery cone may be helpful to protect the gums while they heal. Bad breath is best prevented with a good oral health care routine . If your cat will tolerate teeth brushing, that’s the best place to start. It’s easier to make brushing part of your cat’s daily life. Start with a little bit of feline toothpaste on your finger and rub it on the outer surface of your cat’s teeth. Afterward, give your feline friend a special treat that they love . If they do OK with this, you can work up to using a soft pet tooth brush or finger toothbrush . Don’t worry about getting the inner side of the teeth—focus your efforts on the outer surface. Always follow these daily teeth brushing sessions with a treat . Another way to minimize harmful bacteria is with food or water additives that decrease the buildup of plaque. ProDen PlaqueOff® is a powdered supplement that you can mix with your cat’s food to minimize plaque sticking to the teeth. Several cat treats are also approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) to promote good oral health, including Greenies™ Feline™ Dental Treats and Purina® DentaLife® dental cat treats. Never use human toothpastes in pets, as several of the ingredients can cause upset stomach, vomiting , and diarrhea in cats . Bring your cat to your vet every six to 12 months for regular examinations to treat and prevent any problems that may lead to halitosis. If your cat’s breath stinks, it may be a sign that they have dental disease or another medical condition that needs to be checked out. Normal cat breath should not be smelly. While you should make an appointment to get your cat checked out, it is likely not a cause for worry unless bad breath is accompanied by decreased appetite, vomiting, or low energy. Davis E.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_basal_cell_tumor,Basal Cell Tumor in Cats,"A cat’s skin, or epidermis, is made up of several layers. The bottom layer contains basal cells, which are responsible for producing new skin cells. A basal cell tumor is an abnormal growth and proliferation of these cells, their associated hair follicles, or sweat glands. Basal cell tumors are the most common type of skin tumor for cats, occurring in about 25% of all cases. Although extremely rare, malignant basal cell tumors, also called carcinomas, grow in the area where the tumor is located and spread, or metastasize, elsewhere in the body. Fortunately, most basal cell tumors in cats are benign, do not spread, and are easy to remove. Because basal cell tumors occur on the skin, the most noticeable sign will be a growth somewhere on your cat’s body. They can occur anywhere, but have a higher tendency to be found on the head, neck, back, or feet. They often appear like a single, firm, hairless, sometimes ulcerated mass that may arise from a stalk or be freely moveable. Although they vary in size, they are often small, usually less than a few centimeters in diameter. In cats, they can range in color from gray to black. They can also at times be filled with fluid. Basal cell tumors are an abnormal and uncontrolled growth of basal cells. In humans, there is a correlation between UV light (sun damage) and the development of basal cell tumors, and this relationship is suspected in cats as well, but has not been confirmed. Many factors, from chemical and toxin exposure to genetics, have been considered, especially since the tumors occur more commonly in older cats and in domestic medium- and long-hair breeds such as Persians, Angoras, and Himalayans. A physical exam is performed to locate a basal cell tumor and to determine its size and the extent of surgery required for removal. Your veterinarian may want to perform an FNAC (fine-needle aspiration cytology) of the mass. A small sample of the tumor is collected with a needle, then submitted for analysis. The test, generally non-invasive and minimally uncomfortable, is often performed bedside in the clinic. If FNAC results are inconclusive, your veterinarian may elect to remove a piece of the tumor (biopsy) to send out for analysis or to remove the entire tumor, which should also be sent for analysis to ensure its complete removal and confirmation of basal cell tumor. Prior to any anesthesia and surgery, your veterinarian may recommend a blood profile to review the cat’s kidney and liver function. The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the entire tumor, then microscopic examination of the tissue for diagnosis. Successful removal of the tumor with clean margins almost always results in a good long-term prognosis. For smaller tumors, cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen is used to freeze off the tumor) may be an option. Some pet parents may elect not to have a benign tumor removed. In that case, you will need to monitor the tumor and report any changes in size or appearance to your veterinarian. Fortunately, basal cell tumors rarely metastasize to other organs. Once surgically removed, they have an extremely rare incidence of growing back. So the prognosis is usually excellent! However, malignant tumors can be locally aggressive and may require more extensive surgery for the same type of prognosis. As smaller masses are easier to remove surgically and have less inherent risk of complications, consult with your veterinarian at the first sign of any type of growth on your pet. Once released from the clinic, your cat will most likely be feeling like their normal self in no time; however, expect a few weeks for a full recovery and getting back to their normal routine, as sutures require some time before they can be removed. Fortunately, just because your cat develops one basal cell tumor doesn’t mean they will develop more in the future.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_bile_duct_carcinoma,Bile Duct Cancer in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Bile duct carcinomas are an aggressive form of cancer, with metastasis occurring in 67 to 88 percent of affected animals. They are historically difficult to completely remove by surgical means. This malignant cancer typically arises from the the epithelia, the cellular lining of the hepatic (liver) bile ducts, and occurs more often in the intrahepatic bile ducts (within the liver) rather than in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver). Complications of this disease include a failure of the bile to pass through the bile ducts due to the mass of tissue that is blocking the duct, and metastasis to the lungs, lymph nodes of the liver and peritoneum (abdominal lining). Because of carcinoma's tendency to metastasize widely, it can also spread to other regional lymph nodes, like the diaphragm (the thin muscular wall dividing the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity), intestines, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, and the bone. This is classified as a particularly malignant form of cancer, therefore, animals with this disease usually have a guarded to poor prognosis. Bile duct carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer that is found to affect cats. While its incidence does not appear to be related to breed, it has been found to be more common in female cats, and in cats that are ten years of age or older. Often, cats with bile duct cancer will have a round or swollen abdomen, which can be due to an enlarged liver or fluid in the abdomen. Other common symptoms associated with the disease include: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you provide, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition (such as exposure to toxins). Following the initial exam, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. From these your veterinarian will check for elevated liver enzymes, the confirmation of which is indicative of an inflamed or damaged liver that has spilled enzymes into the bloodstream. A coagulation profile will also be ordered to test whether your cat's blood is clotting properly. X-rays to visualize the abdomen and liver will be taken to localize the carcinoma. An abdominal ultrasound will also be needed to observe the texture and size of the liver and surrounding abdominal organs. If your veterinarian suspects cancer, the lungs will need to be examined using X-ray imaging, since this type if carcinoma is know to have a high rate of metastasis, commonly affecting the lungs and lymph nodes. If cancer is suspected, it will be necessary for your veterinarian to perform a liver biopsy in order to confirm it. The sample can often be taken by fine needle aspiration, but in some circumstances, a doctor may need a larger tissue sample and will need to perform a simple surgery to collect it. This can be done using a laparoscope, a tubular diagnostic tool that is equipped with a camera and forceps for collecting tissue, and which is inserted through a small surgical incision in the abdominal cavity. The tissue sample taken will be sent for laboratory analysis. Similarly, if your cat has fluid in its abdomen, your veterinarian will draw some out to be sent to the lab for analysis. Pending the results of these tests, your veterinarian will treat your cat's symptoms as necessary. Surgery to remove the liver cancer is the treatment of choice. Up to 75 percent of the liver can be removed if the remaining liver tissue is normal. Chemotherapy is generally not indicated, as it has not been found to be a successful treatment in cats. Even with successful surgery and little to no metastasis throughout the body, prognosis remains poor. You will need to return to you veterinarian for follow-up exams every two months after the initial care. Your doctor will measure liver enzyme activity in the blood stream, and check the status of your cat's liver and organs using thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/bilious-vomiting-syndrome-bvs-cats,Bilious Vomiting Syndrome (BVS) in Cats,"Cats can vomit for a variety of reasons. Sometimes the reason is serious, such as underlying organ dysfunction. Other times, cats may vomit due to more simple problems, like hairballs . And when cats throw up yellow liquid, they may be vomiting bile or stomach acid. Bile is a substance that is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It is greenish in color and helps with digestion, secreted in the small intestine to break down food. When bile builds up it can back up into the stomach, which irritates the stomach lining. Cats can vomit up bile or stomach acid when their stomach has been empty for prolonged periods. Usually, if a cat vomits yellow liquid it is due to some underlying cause, whether a primary gastrointestinal issue or because another system in their body is not functioning properly. Rarely, cats will vomit because of bilious vomiting syndrome (BVS). BVS is a common condition in dogs, but it is rarely seen in cats. It’s characterized by vomiting up stomach acid or bile, usually overnight or first thing in the morning when a cat’s stomach has been empty for a while. While BVS is not considered a medical emergency, vomiting can be. Cats with this condition may vomit first thing in the morning, but they act normally otherwise. These cats eat, drink, and play as usual. This chronic condition can look very similar to persistent vomiting that is seen with many other diseases, so it’s important to talk to your veterinarian. If your cat is not eating, weak, lethargic , or vomiting several times in an hour (protracted vomiting), seek veterinary care right away. Symptoms of BVS in cats include: Vomiting up yellow or green liquid Vomiting first thing in the morning before eating Appetite changes Weight loss Abdominal pain Nausea While the exact cause of BVS in cats is unknown, it’s believed to be the result of a motility (pace of food movement) issue with the GI tract. The duodenum is the first segment of the small intestine. When it’s irritated (sometimes by parasites like Giardia or from chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it can lead to reflux. IBD is a condition that leads to thickening of a cat’s intestines. The thickened bowel does not have the good motility as a normal bowel, which can result in delayed emptying of the colon and reflux of bile from the small intestine into the stomach. Duodenal reflux is the movement of intestinal contents backward into the stomach, rather than forward down the GI tract. When the bile enters the stomach, it causes irritation to the lining. This causes a cat to vomit bile. BVS is typically seen in cats with concurrent diseases like IBD. BVS is usually more of a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning your vet will want to rule out more common illnesses before diagnosing your cat with this condition. While your vet will start with a physical exam and history, they will likely want to run bloodwork, do a urinalysis, and take X-rays to look for any abnormalities. For a cat experiencing weight loss or chronic vomiting, a vet may test for feline leukemia , feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and thyroid issues. They may also recommend an abdominal ultrasound. Other causes of chronic, intermittent vomiting that your vet will want to rule out include: Kidney disease Liver disease Hyperthyroidism Inflammatory bowel disease Parasites Dietary food intolerances Be sure to tell your vet when the vomiting episodes started and what frequency they are occurring. It’s helpful if you can keep a log of what time of day they vomit and what the vomit looks like. For example, is it always yellow-green, or does it sometimes contain undigested food? Bilious vomiting syndrome can’t be cured. However, it can typically be managed by feeding a cat smaller meal more frequently. Pets that have this condition often vomit in the morning after a long fast, having not eaten since an early dinner the previous day. Feeding a snack right before bed can be helpful in stimulating your cat’s GI tract to digest the meal and help propel stomach contents forward. Prescription diets may be recommended by your vet. BVS may be managed with medications. Acid reducers can help minimize irritation of a cat’s stomach that occurs when bile backs up. Famotidine , an over-the-counter antacid, is often prescribed. Additionally, some cats may benefit from a pro-motility medication, like metoclopramide or cisapride , to aid in normal digestion. If your cat developed BVS secondary to another underlying cause, your vet may prescribe additional medications to treat those conditions. Management of BVS is usually centered around promoting good motility of the stomach and intestines. This motility can be stimulated by feeding small meals more frequently. Feeding small meals three to six times per day can reduce the amount of time your cat has an empty stomach. Remember, if you are adding in a late-night snack or small meals midday, be sure to reduce the total quantity fed during normal mealtimes. Make sure that the total amount of food fed is the same; just split up into smaller portions throughout the day. Avoid overfeeding your cat too many calories, as obesity can lead to many issues down the road. Sometimes prescription diets are recommended in cats that vomit frequently. Your veterinarian may recommend a trial of a highly digestible diet like Hills® i/d Digestive Care , Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal , or Purina® EN Gastroenteric . Some cats may benefit from a hypoallergenic or novel protein diet like Hills® z/d or Royal Canin® Selected Protein . Occasionally, switching to a canned food diet can be helpful in promoting quicker stomach emptying, as dry food takes longer to move out of the stomach. While there is no way to prevent BVS, you can reduce your cat’s risk of developing this condition. Preventing the stomach from being empty for long periods of time by feeding smaller, more frequent meals may reduce your cat’s risk of struggling with bilious vomiting syndrome. “Bilious” means that the vomit contains bile. Bile is greenish yellow in color. Vomit that contains bile usually has a greenish or dark yellow color. Bilious vomiting syndrome itself is not very serious. However, if a cat develops aspiration pneumonia secondary to vomiting, that can be serious. Featured Image: bymuratdeniz/E+ via Getty Images References: Cote, E. Bilious Vomiting Syndrome .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/bird-flu-in-cats,Bird Flu in Cats: What It Is and How To Protect Your Cat,".shock/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Though birds and poultry are most affected by bird flu , the virus can sometimes jump to other species as well—including our pets. Dozens of domesticated cats have been diagnosed with bird flu, or avian influenza A (H5N1), since March 2024, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) . Though extremely rare, bird flu can also infect humans who are in close contact with a sick animal. In recent weeks, reports of bird flu in cats have been in the news. Confirmed cases are linked to the cats’ diet—specifically, contaminated raw food and raw milk . Despite these reports, the risk of bird flu in cats remains very low, especially when pet parents take proper precautions. Here’s what you need to know about avian flu in cats. Bird flu is a viral infection that’s widespread in various bird species. Sometimes the virus infects other mammals , including cows and other farm animals, as well as wild animals like mountain lions, coyotes, and foxes. Bird flu can also infect cats, with a mortality rate as high as 67%, according to the University of Maryland’s School of Public Health . Bird flu in cats is a medical emergency. If your cat shows any symptoms, take them to the vet immediately. Cats contract bird flu through exposure to infected birds and food products. This includes: Wild birds your cat may interact with outside Chickens, ducks, turkeys, and other farm animals your cat may be in close proximity to Drinking contaminated raw milk Eating raw cat food made with parts of an infected bird According to the AVMA , cats who are in contact with dairy or poultry farm workers may also be at risk. Symptoms of avian flu in cats include: Lethargy Fever Appetite loss Difficulty breathing Red eyes Eye discharge Runny nose Seizures Death Bird flu in cats can be difficult to diagnose. Your vet will likely start with a thorough history to determine if your pet has been in contact with any potentially infected birds or raw milk/poultry. Your vet will also perform a detailed physical exam to look for clinical signs that may be consistent with bird flu in your cat. If bird flu is suspected, your veterinarian will likely collect samples to send out to a laboratory to rule out other potential causes or to confirm H5N1. This may include nasal or throat swabs and/or blood work to detect antibodies or the virus itself. Unfortunately, bird flu is usually diagnosed post-mortem (after a cat has passed away) due to the virus. There is currently no cure for bird flu in cats, or any animal. Treatment focuses on supportive care to manage the symptoms and prevent complications. Cats who are suspected of having bird flu will likely be placed in isolation to minimize the spread. They may also be treated with IV fluids, oxygen therapy, and antibiotics, depending on severity. Nutritional support is sometimes needed if they’re having trouble eating. The chances of your cat coming into contact with bird flu are very low. If you’re concerned, there are ways to reduce your cat’s chances of exposure. Letting your cat roam outdoors unsupervised poses many risks to their health, including bird flu. Outdoor cats kill about 2.4 billion birds every year, according to the American Bird Conservancy . If your cat catches and/or eats a bird with bird flu, they can become infected, too. Cats should never drink dairy milk for many reasons—milk causes stomach upset and has a high fat count, and many cats are lactose intolerant. But it’s especially important to never let your cat drink raw milk. “Raw milk” refers to milk that hasn’t been pasteurized. This means harmful bacteria and viruses, like bird flu, can remain present and pose a serious health risk to not only your cat, but to you, too. Raw food is unprocessed food made from raw ingredients (uncooked meat and organs). Studies show that raw pet food is more likely than other forms of cat food to be contaminated with pathogens like salmonella , E. coli , and bird flu.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_blastomycosis,Blastomycosis in Cats,"Blastomycosis, sometimes called blasto, is a disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The condition more commonly occurs in dogs , although it also occurs in cats. Blasto primarily affects the lungs of cats, but it can also progress to the brain and spinal cord, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal system. The fungus is commonly found in soil near wet environments, such as riverbanks, lakes, and swamps, or around decomposing organic matter, such as wooded areas and forests. Many cases of blastomycosis have occurred in the Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Ohio river basins; near the Great Lakes; and in Canada’s Manitoba and Ontario provinces. Cats can acquire these infections by ingesting or inhaling the blasto organism or by the microbe entering the skin through a wound or cut (it cannot penetrate intact skin). The time between exposure to this organism to when a cat starts to show clinical signs ranges from 5-12 weeks. Blastomycosis is not contagious between animals and people. Unfortunately, it can be fatal to those infected. The symptoms of blastomycosis vary, depending on which organ system is involved. Below is a list of blasto symptoms, ordered from most to least common in cats. These symptoms can also be non-specific, meaning they are not directly related to the fungal lesion but are related to a general feeling of illness. It is important to bring your cat to a veterinarian as quickly as possible if they have any signs of blastomycosis. Weight loss Lethargy Coughing Decreased or lack of appetite (anorexia) Difficulty breathing Nasal discharge, especially bloody discharge Eye issues or ocular changes, such as inflammation, redness, swelling, or blindness Enlarged lymph nodes, lumps under the skin Lameness, limping Skin lesions, abscesses Fever Neurologic changes Bloody urine Difficulty urinating The most common way for cats to contract blastomycosis is by ingesting or inhaling the fungal spores, but it can also be transmitted directly into a cat’s circulation through a skin wound. While infectious fungal spores are found only in soil near waterways, both indoor cats and cats with access to the outdoors can be infected, since the spores live and spread in the air. Once the fungal spores are inhaled or ingested, the warmth of the cat’s body allows the spores to transform into budding yeast. The yeast establishes lesions in the lungs or broken skin, and from there it can spread to the bloodstream and infect other organs. Though fungal infections can cause disease in healthy cats, those with a compromised immune system or those weak or sick with other illnesses commonly become infected more readily. Cats that are provided antibiotic drugs or immunosuppressive agents long-term also appear to be more susceptible to fungal infections. An important aspect of diagnosing a blasto infection is knowing if your cat frequents the type of place that harbors the fungal organism, so providing your veterinarian with a detailed history of your pet’s activities is crucial. Your veterinarian will probably do a complete physical examination and order bloodwork (chemistry panel, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel) to assess body function and to rule out other conditions that might cause similar signs. A urine and blood test specifically for blastomycosis is only reliable for dogs, so the diagnosis in cats is generally made through visualization under a microscope of fungal organisms in infected tissues. If your cat has lesions on the skin or other body organs, a biopsy will be recommended to collect cells or remove a piece of abnormal tissue that will then be tested for the blasto organism. These lesions can be seen during a physical examination as skin abscesses, on radiographs as lung nodules, or on advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI as advanced lung disease or other body systems being affected. In coughing cats, with or without lung disease evident on initial chest x-rays, an airway wash (tracheal wash or tracheal lavage) is typically ordered. This procedure requires your cat to be heavily sedated so that lung fluid samples can be collected for analysis. It is possible that your vet can see the fungal spores in this analysis, which would confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is highly dependent on how severely affected your cat is. Cats that are having breathing issues or those not eating are more likely to be hospitalized. Treatment for feline blastomycosis consists of a prolonged course of oral antifungal medications. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for both cats and dogs with blasto. Combination therapy with other antifungal medications is sometimes needed for advanced cases or those not responding to itraconazole alone. If the fungus has infected the respiratory system, your veterinarian will also work to stabilize your cat’s condition and treat any severe symptoms. Supportive care to help with symptoms may include oxygen therapy for those having trouble breathing, IV fluids, anti-inflammatories, appetite stimulants, and liver protectants. Antifungal medications have the propensity for side effects on the liver and gastrointestinal system. For this reason, it is important that your vet monitor your cat’s liver enzymes and other body functions with routine bloodwork and urine testing during and after treatment. The prognosis for feline blastomycosis is guarded, but treatment is improving with the availability of newer antifungal medications. Unfortunately, the death rate in cats with severe respiratory infections is high, even after treatment begins. Antifungal medication is given daily for two to six months. Once cats have made it through the first two weeks of treatment, the prognosis for recovery improves. It is critical to give all medications as directed. Working closely with your veterinarian and following all medication instructions will increase your cat’s chance of survival and reduce the likelihood of relapse and returning symptoms. To know when treatment can be discontinued, routine x-rays of the lungs will likely be done to ensure that the lesions are healing. Medications are usually continued for at least a month after clinical signs have dissipated and lung lesions are no longer visible on x-rays. Relapse can occur in cats with very severe cases of blastomycosis or those in which treatment was stopped too soon. There is no way to prevent blastomycosis except keeping your cat away from areas that have a high risk for fungus, such as riverbanks and decaying organic material. If your cat spends time outside in environments that are damp and wet with minimal sunlight and you see symptoms that may indicate a fungal infection, contact your veterinarian immediately. While there is no vaccine currently available to prevent blastomycosis, studies are ongoing to formulate an effective and safe vaccine against this fungal disease.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_von_willebrand_disease,Bleeding Disorder in Cats,"PetMD Editorial VWF is an autosomal (non-sex-linked) trait, which both males and females express and transmit genetically and with equal frequency. Von Willebrand’s disease (vWD) is a blood disease caused by a deficiency of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), an adhesive glycoprotein in the blood required for normal platelet binding (i.e., clotting) at the sites of small blood vessel injuries. In addition, vWF is a carrier protein for coagulation Factor VIII (necessary for blood to clot). A lack of vWF impairs platelet stickiness and clumping. Similar to hemophilia in humans, this condition can lead to excessive bleeding following an injury, due to the lack of clotting. The expression pattern of the severe forms (Types 2 and 3 vWD) is recessive while the milder form (Type 1 vWD) appears to be recessive or incompletely dominant. This clotting disorder is rare in cats. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. A blood chemical profile will be performed, with a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. If there has been blood loss, a regenerative anemia will be seen on the complete blood count. Typically, the platelet count will be normal (unless your cat has experienced recent, massive bleeding), and coagulation tests will show normal results. A clinical diagnosis of von Willebrand disease is based on a specific measurement of plasma vWF concentration bound to the antigen (vWF:Ag). The length of time that it takes for platelets to plug a small injury will be measured, with a test called the buccal mucosa bleeding time (BMBT). The BMBT test, along with the platelet function analyzer (PFA 100), are point-of-care screening tests where the endpoints are prolonged in patients with platelet clumping defects and vWF deficiency. Prolongation is nonspecific, and may accompany numerous severe disorders of the blood. Transfusion of fresh whole blood, fresh plasma, fresh frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate will supply vWF to the blood. Component therapy (fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate) is best for surgical prophylaxis (prevention) and nonanemic patients, to prevent red cell sensitization and volume overload. Patients with severe vWD may require repeated transfusion to control or prevent hemorrhage. If a cat lacking vWF requires surgery, a pre-operative transfusion should be given just before the procedure. Most cats with mild to moderate vWD will continue to have a good quality of life, requiring minimal or no special treatment. Cats with more severe forms will require transfusion for surgery, and should be transfused if supportive care fails to control a spontaneous bleeding episode. Most of these cats can be maintained comfortably, but their activities will need to be monitored and limited. If your cat has von Willebrand Disease and it has an episode of prolonged bleeding, call your veterinarian and take it to a veterinary clinic immediately for emergency treatment.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_retinal_hemorrhage,Bleeding of the Retina in the Eye in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Retinal hemorrhage is a condition of the innermost lining of the eye in which there is a local or generalized area of bleeding into that lining. This inner lining is referred to as the retina. The retina lays just beneath the middle choroid coat, which in turn lies between the retina and the sclera – the white outer lining of the eye (the part of the eye that can be seen). The choroid coat contains connective tissue and blood vessels, which deliver nutrients and oxygen to the outer layers of the retina. In some cases the retina may separate from this layer. This is termed retinal detachment. The causes of retinal hemorrhage are usually genetic and breed specific. Genetic (present at birth): Acquired (condition that develops sometime later in life/after birth): Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Standard laboratory tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, a blood pressure test and a urinalysis, so as to rule out other causes of disease. The physical exam will entail a full ophthalmic exam using a slit lamp microscope. During this exam, the retina at the back of the eye will be closely observed for abnormalities. The electrical activity of the retina will also be measured. An ultrasound of the eye may also be done if the retina cannot be visualized due to hemorrhaging. Samples of vitreous humor (eye fluid) may be taken for laboratory analysis. Patients with retinal hemorrhage are usually hospitalized and given close care by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications depending on the underlying cause of the disease. Surgery can sometimes be performed to reattach the retina to the choroid coat. Your veterinarian will schedule frequent follow-up appointments for your cat to chart the deterioration or progress (post-surgically) of the retina and the underlying disease that caused it to detach. Repeat bloodwork and ophthalmic exams will be performed during these visits. If your cat becomes blind as a result of the retinal detachment, remember that once the underlying cause of disease has been controlled, the eye will no longer be painful to your cat. Although the blindness may not be reversed, your cat can still lead a happy and fulfilling life indoors as it learns to compensate with its other senses and memorizes the layout of the home. As your cat will be more vulnerable without its sight, you will need to take extra care to protect your cat from harmful situations, such as with other pets and active children. Also, you will need to keep your cat indoors at all times. Image: Xiaojiao Wang via Shutterstock Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/blepharitis-cats,Blepharitis in Cats,"Blepharitis in cats is inflammation of the eyelids. It often occurs simultaneously with inflammation of the pink inner lining of the eyelids ( conjunctivitis or “pink eye”). If the eyelids are very swollen, blepharitis may limit the cat’s field of vision. Blepharitis is very common in cats and most will develop it at some point in their lives. If an infection is causing blepharitis, the infection may be contagious to other cats. Blepharitis is not typically an emergency unless there is trauma to the eye due to an accident. Blepharitis may cause your cat to paw at their eye, risking injury. Placing an e-collar or recovery cone on your cat until they can see a veterinarian may help reduce self-injury to the eye while you wait for your appointment. Blepharitis itself is a symptom of an underlying cause. The signs of blepharitis in cats include: Swollen eyelids Redness, scabbing, or crusting of the eyelids Rubbing or pawing at the affected eye(s) Sores or wounds around the eyes Watery or thick, clear to green discharge from the eyes Loss of hair ( alopecia ) around the eyes Concurrent conjunctivitis There are many causes of blepharitis in cats, including infections or parasitic infestation, allergy, autoimmune issues, congenital or developmental problems, and injury. Infectious and parasitic causes of blepharitis include: Ringworm (dermatophytosis) Bacterial infection, such as Staphylococcus Demodex mites or mange Insect or spider bites Fungal infection such as cryptococcosis With sudden allergic reactions triggered by bug bites or medications, the eyelids may swell as part of the initial reaction. Chronic allergies in cats typically appear as inflammation in the skin rather than hay fever signs seen in humans. Though the eyelids aren’t specifically affected in most cats with chronic allergies, they sometimes swell due to environmental or food allergies . Autoimmune conditions that can cause blepharitis in cats include pemphigus (an autoimmune disease of the skin) or systemic lupus erythematosus (which can affect many systems in the body). Congenital or developmental causes include: Entropion (eyelid rolled in) Ectopic cilia (eyelash disorders) In these cases, eyelid swelling often occurs due to hair or fur irritating the cornea (outer clear layer of the eye), which may cause the cat to rub and paw at their eyes. Wounds on the eyelid or trauma to the eye region can also cause eyelid swelling. Examples of injuries include a scratch in a cat fight, bites to the head, or blunt trauma to the eye region. The veterinarian can diagnose blepharitis in cats through simple physical examination. Importantly, blepharitis itself is not a disease but rather a symptom of another problem. To determine what is causing swelling of the eyelids, your veterinarian may perform additional tests including: Looking into the back of the eye (fundic exam). Staining the eye to look for ulcers. Testing for upper respiratory infections, which usually involves taking a swab of the inside of the eyelids, nose, and/or throat and sending to a laboratory. Sedated examination of the eyelids to check for eyelash abnormalities, masses, or foreign objects under the lids. Cytology or skin scrape of the skin around the eyes, which involves looking under a microscope for infectious organisms or cell abnormalities. Blood tests to check systemic health and rule out feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) . To help the veterinarian with the diagnosis, pet parents should discuss: The cat’s vaccination history How long the signs have been occurring Any trauma to the eye Any other affected animals in the home History of upper respiratory infections Whether the cat tests positive for FeLV or FIV If an infection is suspected, medications may be prescribed either to go topically within the eye or orally. Examples include: Doxycycline (oral antibiotic) Azithromycin (oral antibiotic) Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (oral antibiotic) Oxytetracycline and polymyxin B (topical antibiotic) Idoxuridine (topical antiviral) Famciclovir (oral antiviral) Itraconazole (oral antifungal) Do not use triple antibiotic ointments or ocular ointments meant for humans in your cat’s eyes. Your veterinarian will usually recommend topical or oral parasiticides if mange is the cause. For eyelid abnormalities, surgery may be required. For example, if the eyelids are rolled in (entropion), a procedure will be done to turn the eyelid outward. If there is an abnormal eyelash growing inside the eyelid, the follicle may be frozen (cryosurgery) to prevent regrowth. Allergic causes of inflamed eyelids will be managed based on what is causing the allergy. Treatments may include antihistamines, medications such as cyclosporine , immunotherapy (allergy shots), or dietary changes. With treatment, most infectious causes of blepharitis should improve within seven to 14 days. Infection with ringworm may result in a slower recovery time. Keep in mind that ringworm is contagious to other animals and humans, so use caution when handling your cat. Consider wearing gloves and washing your hands and isolating the sick cat from other pets in the home. Speak with your veterinarian about ways to ensure your home environment is kept clean. With proper treatment, mange-induced inflammation usually improves within several weeks. Fungal infections such as cryptococcus can be difficult to treat, with treatment sometimes lasting for months. If your cat had surgery due to an eyelid abnormality, recovery takes about two weeks. Your vet may recommend an e-collar to help aid in the recovery process. It’s absolutely essential that your cat’s e-collar remains in place until your veterinarian clears you to remove it. If your cat can rub at or scratch the eye, they can damage their surgical site. Some cats with eyelid infections may be predisposed to developing them again, especially if they have an underlying condition that weakens their immune system like FIV. Keeping your cat on flea and tick preventatives and up to date on their vaccinations can help mitigate the risk of infectious or parasitic blepharitis. Yes, blepharitis causes pain and discomfort for cats. Most cases of blepharitis will go away within two weeks. Some require treatment to improve, while others clear up on their own over time.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_blind_quiet_eye,Blind Quiet Eye in Cats,"PetMD Editorial If your cat has loss of vision in one or both eyes without ocular vascular injection or other apparent signs of eye inflammation, it may be suffering from Blind Quiet Eye. This disease may occur due to abnormalities in retinal image detection, retinal focusing, optic nerve transmission, or simply the central nervous system's inability to interpret images correctly. Because Blind Quiet Eye directly affects the cat's vision, it may display several signs, including: In addition, these problems may become more exaggerated when outside at night. There are several causes for Blind Quiet Eye, such as cataracts, central nervous system lesions, and the lens' inability to focus correctly. Other common causes include: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health and the onset and nature of the symptoms to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination (including an opthalmoscopic exam) as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC) to rule out potential systemic causes of the disease. During the ophthalmic exam a penlight will be used to rule out potential systemic causes of the disease, such as cataracts or retinal detachment. (In cases of retinal detachment, the systemic blood pressure is often elevated.) Ophthalmoscopy, meanwhile, may reveal progressive retinal atrophy or optic nerve disease. If the ophthalmic exam reveals nothing irregular, it may suggest sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS), retrobulbar optic neuritis (inflammation of the optic nerve after it exits the eye toward the brain), or a central nervous system (CNS) lesion. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, electroretinography -- which measures the electrical responses of photoreceptor cells in the retina -- makes it possible to differentiate retinal from optic nerve or CNS disease. Ocular ultrasounds and CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans are also very helpful to visualize and diagnose orbital or CNS lesions. Your veterinarian will try to localize the disease and will often refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for Blind Quiet Eye brought on by SARDS, progressive retinal atrophy, optic nerve atrophy, or optic nerve hypoplasia. However, cataracts, luxated lenses, and some forms of retinal detachment may be treated surgically. In addition, cats with retinal detachment should have their exercise severely restricted until the retina is firmly reattached. Those with nutritionally-induced retinopathy, meanwhile, should be fed a diet with sufficient amounts of taurine in it. With assistance, blind pets can lead relatively normal and functional lives. However, cats with progressive retinal atrophy or genetic cataracts should not be bred. Your veterinarian will recommend you with some basic safety concepts, such as examining for potential hazards in your home. He or she will also schedule regular follow-up exams to ensure that any ocular inflammation is controlled and to ensure, if possible, that your pet’s vision is maintained. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pulmonary_thromboembolism,Blood Clot in the Lungs of Cats,"PetMD Editorial A pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) occurs when a blood clot blocks the flow of blood to an important artery that feeds into the cat's lungs. Slow-flowing blood and blood vessel damage, in addition to blood which clots too easily, can predispose a cat to thrombus formation. Most of the time, PTE is caused by another underlying disease. Pulmonary thromboemboli (blood clots) can originate in the right atrium of the heart, or in many of the major veins throughout the body. As the cat's body makes oxygenated blood to deliver to the heart and lungs, this clump of blood cells is carried through the bloodstream toward the lungs, where it gets caught in a narrow portion of one of the passages of the arterial network that feeds oxygenated blood to the lungs. In this way, the blood flow through that artery is halted, and oxygenated blood is not able to reach the lung. The severity of the condition is, to a degree, dependent on the size of the blood clot. PTE can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. In most cases, the bloodwork will be necessary for pinpointing an underlying disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues to the clot's origin. Arterial blood gases will be taken to check for low oxygen in the blood. A coagulation profile will be done to detect a clotting disorder; these tests include the one-stage prothrombin time (OSPT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Heartworm serology will also be performed. X-ray images of the cat's chest will allow your veterinarian to visually examine your cat for pulmonary artery abnormalities, enlargement of the heart, lung patterns, or fluid in the lungs. Your veterinarian may choose the more sensitive echocardiogram (an ultrasound image of the heart) to see the motion and size of the heart and its surrounding structures more clearly, because a thrombus in the right chamber of the heart, or in the main pulmonary artery, will sometimes show up on an echocardiogram. Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings can indicate cor pulmonale, enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart due to increased blood pressure in the lungs. Serious heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias) will be evident on an ECG. There is also pulmonary angiography, which uses an injection of a radio-contrasting agent into the cat's lung arteries to improve visibility on the X-ray, and spiral computed tomography (CT), which is three-dimensional X-ray imaging for non-selective angiography. Cats with PTE should be hospitalized, primarily for oxygen therapy. If the cat is not receiving enough oxygen to its heart, lungs, or brain, the veterinarian will recommend rest in a caged environment; this is generally due to hypoxemia or syncope. However, the underlying cause of the condition will be treated once your veterinarian has settled on a definitive diagnosis. Unfortunately, PTE is usually fatal. Cats will often suffer a recurrence of PTE unless the underlying cause of the disease is found and corrected. Your veterinarian will schedule weekly checkups with the your cat to monitor its blood clotting times, since anticoagulant medications can cause bleeding disorders on the opposite side of the scale. The new low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant medicines are much safer for use, but they are also more expensive. Close supervision of your pet, and contact with your veterinarian will usually be sufficient, especially since your cat may need to be on anticoagulant medication for several months. Doctor-approved physical activity, or other physical therapy, may improve blood flow. Your veterinarian will be able to advise you on the appropriate activity for your individual pet's needs. The goal is to prevent future PTE in immobile cats with severe disease. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_cyclic_hematopoiesis,Blood Disorders Related to FeLV Infection in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cyclic hematopoiesis is a disorder of the formation of blood cells, which rarely affects cats. When it does occur, reports are related to cats that are infected with the leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, a virus that suppresses the immune system in cats. Cyclic hematopoiesis that has been observed in cats appears to be another possible non-cancerous manifestation of the FeLV infection. This blood disorder is directly related to the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in cats. The FeLV virus is transmitted by other infected cats. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on the cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. Cyclic hematopoiesis cause formation abnormalities throughout the circulatory system's cell lines, such as in the formation of blood platelets, the cells responsible for clotting; neutrophils, white blood cells that are essential for the destruction of infectious microorganisms; reticulocytes, immature blood cells that occur during the regeneration of blood; and monocytes, white blood cells that are formed in the bone marrow and spleen, and which ingest cellular debris and foreign particles in the blood. If the complete blood count shows an abnormally low number of neutrophils and cyclic variations of other cell lines over several days, along with signs of a feline leukemia virus infection, this will strongly support a diagnosis of cyclic hematopoiesis. Supportive therapy will include fluid therapy and antibiotics for treating infections. Depending on the stage of the virus, the hematopoiesis may be brought under control with the medication prednisolone, or with the administration of corticosteroid. Further treatment will be based on how well your cat's immune system is fighting the FeLV infection. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hemothorax,Blood in the Chest in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hemothorax is the medical term used to identify a condition in which blood has collected in the chest cavity, or thorax. This condition may occur suddenly or over a long period of time, and it can occur for a variety of reasons. There does not appear to be a particular age, gender, or breed of cat that is more predisposed to this condition than another. Acute onset: Associated with a causative factor: Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a standard blood chemical profile, complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis so as to rule out other causes of disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Clotting profiles should be performed on a blood sample to verify for delayed clotting times. The packed cell volume, hemoglobin and platelet count will be lower than normal. The blood chemical profile may show signs of liver failure (which would cause bleeding into bodily cavities since clotting factors would not be produced). The fluid in the chest should be sampled and analyzed at a laboratory for a comparison with peripheral blood. Platelets are often found in chest fluid samples. X-rays are crucial for visualizing the extent of the fluid build-up in the chest, the collapse of lung lobes, and any masses which might be present in the chest cavity. An ultrasound of the chest can reveal a diseased condition with an even greater sensitivity than an x-ray image would. Patients suffering from hemothorax should be treated on an inpatient basis. They must receive fluid therapy to correct their blood loss into the chest cavity. If the cat also has air free (outside the lungs) in the chest cavity, this must be immediately corrected. If the lungs are bruised, ventilator support may be necessary. These patients often also need oxygen therapy, and will need to be kept warm to prevent shock. If the cat's blood sample has a delayed clotting time, then a plasma or blood transfusion may be needed to restore clotting factors or to provide red blood cells for oxygen transport. Severe or recurrent thoracic hemorrhage may require surgical exploration. While your cat is recovering from hemothorax, it is probably best to avoid giving it any aspirin or other over the counter medications that might decrease clotting. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to treat your cat's underlying condition. If your cat shows signs of a recurrence of hemothorax, notify your veterinarian immediately; surgery may be necessary for correcting recurring cases. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_pancytopenia,Blood Related Deficiencies in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pancytopenia does not actually refer to a disease, but rather to the simultaneous development of a number of blood-related deficiencies: non-regenerative anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The root word pan refers to all or whole, and cytopenia refers to a lack of cells circulating in the blood. Nonregenerative anemia is a condition characterized by a low red-blood cell count and the bone marrow’s lack of response to produce additionally needed red-blood cells; leucopenia refers to a low white-blood cell count; and thrombocytopenia refers to a low platelet and thrombocyte count (the cells that function in blood coagulation). Pancytopenia can affect both cats and dogs, and may develop from a number of multiple causes. There is no specific age, or breed of animal known to be more susceptible to the development of pancytopenia. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library. The symptoms that develop in the patient depend largely on the underlying cause leading to pancytopenia. Some symptoms of leucopenia (low white-blood cell count) include repeated episodes of fever, and frequent or persistent infections. Some symptoms of anemia due to low red-blood cell count include sluggishness and pale gums. Low platelet count due to thrombocytopenia may lead to tiny pinpoint bruises on the body, referred to as petechial hemorrhate, or bleeding from the moist tissues of the body, known as mucosal bleeding. Other general symptoms may include lethargy, bleeding (i.e., nose bleeds or blood in the urine), and fever. There are a variety of causes for pancytopenia. These include infectious diseases, such as hepatitis; the tick-born disease ehrlichiosis, exposure to poisons such as thallium; proliferative diseases such as bone marrow cancer; and immune-mediated diseases such as aplastic anemia, in which the bone marrow loses its ability to produce red-blood cells. A veterinary exam is necessary to determine the underlying cause of pancytopenia, and to diagnose the condition itself. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood count, and a chemical blood profile. Other possible tests include urine analysis, immunologic tests for infections diseases like feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and a bone marrow examination. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, and onset of symptoms, if any. Treatment depends on the primary condition that led to pancytopenia, as it is essential that the primary disease be diagnosed and treated first. Aggressive antibiotic therapy and blood transfusions may be necessary. Medications for the underlying cause may be necessary, in addition to various medications to stimulate the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood-cell that fights infection), and another medication to stimulate the production of red-blood cells by bone marrow. Daily physical examinations should be given after initial treatment, including frequent monitoring of body temperature and a periodic complete blood count (CBC). The frequency of CBC checks depends on how severely low the cat’s blood-cell and platelet counts were and are, as well as the underlying cause of the disease. Additional care measures depend upon the underlying cause of disease. Depending on the severity, these may include inpatient care at a hospital, and aggressive therapy. There are many causes of pancytopenia, and it is not possible to prevent against all of them. However, some precautions can be taken. Cats should be kept up to date with vaccinations that may prevent infectious diseases. For cats with cancer, there is a danger of developing pancytopenia as a side effect of cancer treatment, and frequent CBC monitoring will need to be done. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_polycythemia_vera,Blood Thickening in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Polycythemia vera is a blood disorder that involves abnormal blood thickening due to an increase of red blood cell production by the bone marrow. It is primarily seen in older cats. The following symptoms gradually appear but run a chronic course: Although the viscosity of the blood is due to an increased production of red blood cells by the bone marrow, the cause of this overproduction is currently unknown. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing will typically reveal an increase in red blood cell mass, and in about 50 percent of cats, an increased number of white blood cells (leukocytosis). To assess the function of the kidneys and cardiopulmonary systems, your veterinarian will conduct X-rays and abdominal ultrasounds. Echocardiography, meanwhile, is used to evaluate the cardiac functions. He or she will also take a sample of bone marrow and send it to a veterinary pathologist for further examination. Initially, the veterinarian will draw a fair amount of blood and replace it with intravenous fluids to decrease the blood's viscosity. However, this is only for quick relief. Long-term therapy, for both animals and humans, involve using an antineoplastic drug called hydroxyurea, which suppresses the overproduction of red blood cells in the bone marrow. During treatment, your veterinarian will need to see the cat for regular follow-up exams, especially when it is taking hydroxurea, as it may sometimes cause bone marrow suppression. In addition, follow the veterinary oncologist's dosage recommendation when using on chemotherapy medications, such as hydroxurea, because these drugs are highly toxic. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_blood_transfusion_reactions,Blood Transfusion Reactions in Cats,"PetMD Editorial There are a variety of reactions that can occur with the transfusion of any blood product. Purebred cats, especially those that have had previous blood transfusions, are at a higher risk for having severe reactions to transfusion than other animals. Most reactions usually occur during, or shortly after, the transfusion. Reaction to a blood transfusion may be classified by one of the following conditions: immune system related; acute reaction (an immediate, sudden reaction); or delayed reaction. Acute symptoms of a reaction to blood transfusion may include fever, vomiting, weakness, incontinence, shock, collapse, and general loss of transfusion effectiveness. Symptoms of a delayed reaction are usually not directly apparent and result only in a loss of the transfusion’s effectiveness. Many symptoms will vary, depending on the exact cause. Transfusion of contaminated blood can result in fever, shock, and septicemia -- an invasion of disease producing bacteria into the bloodstream. Circulatory overload resulting from rapid or excessive transfusion can result in vomiting, cough, and heart failure. Hypothermia, which can stem from transfusion of cold refrigerated blood -- usually in smaller cats or already hypothermic cats -- is evident by shivering and impaired platelet function. There are several circumstances that may be responsible for a blood transfusion reaction, such as transfusion of a mismatched blood type; transfusion of contaminated blood and consequent blood-born disease from an infected donor; circulatory overload caused by too-rapid or too-large amounts of transfusion; or transfusion of damaged red blood cells which have been improperly stored (i.e., due to excessive heating or freezing). In addition to these causes, the cat’s immune system may react to various components in the donor’s blood. Symptoms will usually surface in the course of 3-14 days. A diagnosis of blood transfusion reaction is based largely on symptoms that present after transfusion. Tests include a urine analysis, retesting of blood type to confirm rejection of donor blood, and a bacteria analysis of the transfused blood. Symptoms of reaction that result in fever or hypotension (low blood pressure ) may also be diagnosed as inflammatory disease, or may be found to have been caused by an infectious disease. If your cat exhibits a reaction to a blood transfusion, your veterinarian will immediately discontinue the transfusion and administer fluids in order to maintain blood pressure and circulation. Depending on the severity and cause of the reaction, additional interventions may be necessary. Specific treatment depends on the cause and symptoms, and may also be administered through medication. For example, intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be given for septicemia, or for bacterial infection. Your cat’s basic vital signs (breathing and pulse) will be tracked before, during, and after a blood transfusion. In addition, temperature, lung sounds, and plasma color should be checked frequently. Blood transfusion reactions may be prevented by following standard blood transfusion protocol: thorough cross-checking of blood types to assure a match, condition of donor blood to prevent infection or spread of disease, and appropriate storage of donor blood. Transfusion should begin initially at an amount of one milliliter per minute, and all transfusion activity should be appropriately recorded in the patient’s medical file. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_multiple_myeloma,Bone Marrow Cancer (Myeloma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Multiple myeloma is an uncommon cancer that is derived from a clonal population of cancerous (malignant) plasma cells in the bone marrow. A “clonal population of cells” is a group of cells that have descended from a single cell; all of them have the same genetic make-up. Plasma cells are specialized white-blood cells, lymphocytes that have been altered to produce immunoglobulin, an immune protein or antibody necessary for fighting disease. Three of four defining features must be present for a diagnosis of multiple myeloma: immune protein from a single clone of cells (known as a monoclonal gammopathy), seen as a spike in the gamma region of a protein analysis of the blood (known as a protein electrophoresis); cancerous plasma cells or a high number of plasma cells in the bone marrow (known as plasmacytosis); destruction of areas of bone (known as lytic bone lesions); and a particular type of protein found in the urine (known as Bence Jones [light-chain] proteinuria). Multiple myeloma occurs primarily in middle-aged or older cats (6-13 years). Attributed to bone infiltration and destruction of bone, effects of proteins produced by the tumor (such as increased protein in the blood leading to sludging of the blood and kidney damage), and infiltration of organ(s) by cancerous cells. Symptoms depend on location and extent of disease. Unknown You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health and onset of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms. Along with a thorough physical examination, your veterinarian will also conduct a thorough ophthalmological examination on your cat, if the eyes are showing symptoms of a diseased state. Symptoms for multiple myeloma resemble those of several other diseases. Your veterinarian will need to rule out a number of other possibilities for the symptoms, such as infections, other types of tumors, and immune-mediated illnesses. To do that, your doctor will conduct a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Diagnostic imaging will include X-rays of the vertebra and limbs to look for bone lesions, and ultrasound to examine the internal organs. Your veterinarian may need to refer you to a veterinary oncologist for the latest information regarding treatment of this disease. Your cat may be hospitalized if there are high levels of urea - waste products and calcium in the blood. Also, if there is a bleeding disorder, or a significant bacterial infection, hospitalization may be required. A blood-cleansing procedure may be used, or blood may be withdrawn and replaced with an equal volume of fluids. If possible, radiation therapy may be used on isolated areas, with the goal of curing the disease, or only to control signs and improve your cat’s condition. If there is a concurrent bacterial infection, it will be treated aggressively with antibiotics. If your cat is being treated with radiation or chemical therapy, it will also need to be guarded against opportunistic infections that can result from the expected lowered immune response (known as immune compromised – a result of the treatment that is used to stop the growth of cancerous cells in the body). You will need to take care to prevent bacterial infections from occurring, such as those caused by puncture wounds from dog or cat fights. Dietary changes will be necessary if your cat is in kidney failure. Affected areas that are nonresponsive to chemotherapy, or single, solitary lesions may be removed surgically. Your veterinarian will want to do a complete blood count and platelet count weekly for at least four weeks to assess bone-marrow response to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Blood tests with abnormal results will be repeated monthly to evaluate response to the treatment. Protein analyses of the blood will be done monthly for several months until normal protein patterns are obtained. Once protein patterns have stabilized, monitoring will be periodically performed for signs of relapse. Abnormal skeletal X-rays should be repeated monthly every other month until they appear normal, and to evaluate your cat’s response to treatment. Chemotherapy is intended to improve your cat’s condition, not to cure the multiple myeloma, but long remissions are possible. Relapse is an expected occurrence. The drugs that are being used will determine the side effects. Your veterinarian will go over what to expect, based on the types of drugs that are prescribed for treatment. Most patients develop mild low white-blood cell counts (leukopenia) during chemotherapy. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_hypertrophic_osteopathy,Bone Overgrowth in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Though rare in cats, hypertrophic osteopathy can create extreme discomfort and pain in your pet. It refers to an abnormal increase in size of bone due to new bone formation, which may cause swellings at all four limbs and is often confused with arthritis. Hypertrophic osteopathy may also cause lameness due to swelling and pain at joints and bones. The exact cause of new bone formation is still unknown, but this condition has been seen in association with various diseases, including: Your veterinarian will take a detailed history, asking you about the duration and frequency of symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will be conducted. The results are usually normal but may vary depending on the underlying disease, if present. X-rays of the bone may reveal new bone formation and help your veterinarian in localizing the disease. He or she may also decide to take bone sample for further evaluation, including investigating for the presence of tumors. Diagnosis of the underlying cause and treating it are major goals for the resolution of the problem. However, as exact etiology is still unknown, finding the underlying cause and treating it is not always possible. Your veterinarian will prescribe painkillers to alleviate pain and drugs to reduce swelling at affected sites. In some cases, surgery may be required to remove the tumor mass. It is important to follow the guidelines and administer medication at the right dosage and time to maintain quality of life. But even after treatment of the primary cause, clinical symptoms may continue for one to two weeks. Bone(s), meanwhile, may take months to get back to its original shape, even with the correction of the underlying disorder and are not known to be fully reversible. Your cat may feel sore and may need therapy for pain management at home. If a metastic tumor is the underlying cause of the hypertrophic osteopathy, prognosis is very poor. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_hemangiosarcoma_bone,Bone Tumor (Hemangiosarcoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hemangiosarcoma is a fast spreading tumor of the endothelial cells, which line the interior surface of the body's blood vessels, including the arteries, veins, intestinal tract, and the bronchi of the lungs. The integrity of the bone may be compromised by the tumor, and fractures in the bone, absent an accident related trauma to the body, are characteristic of bone cancer. Most commonly, this type of tumor is found on the limbs or ribs, but it can occur in other locations as well. As with many types of cancers, hemangiosarcoma is usually diagnosed in cats older than 17 years. The exact cause for hemangiosarcoma of the bone is still unknown. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood profile, a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests may indicate whether any of the organs are being affected, and whether any other conditions are present. Some of the conditions that may be concurrent with hamangiosarcoma are regenerative anemia, which is determined by an abnormally high number of immature red blood cells (meaning that the body is replacing lost red blood cells at a high rate); an abnormally low level of protein in the blood (hypoproteinemia); an abnormally high white blood cell count (leukocytosis), which can be indicative that the body is fighting off a diseased condition; a low level of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia), which are responsible for blood clotting; and blood cells of unequal or abnormal size (anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, respectively). Radiographic studies of the affected bone will also reveal valuable information to help your veterinarian in the diagnosis of this tumor. Computed tomography (CT) scans can help to determine the extent of bone involvement and also help your veterinarian in planning an effective surgery. Biopsy may be attempted for a definitive diagnosis, but this may not be practical for this type of tumor, since it originates in the vessels. A confirmative diagnosis may be based on finding spaces within the vessels that are filled with red blood cells, clots, dead cellular debris, and variable tumor cells. Aggressive surgery remains the method of choice in the treatment of this tumor. The tumor, and possibly the surrounding area, will need to be removed entirely. If the tumor is occurring on a limb, the affected limb will most probably be amputated, a surgery which most cats recover from well. An axial tumor – one that is affecting the area of the head or trunk – may be more difficult to treat. Chemotherapy along with surgery is the recommended treatment plan. Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for progress evaluation visits, starting from the first month after initial treatment and every three months following. Chemotherapy medications have the possibility of toxic side effects, so your veterinarian will need to closely monitor your cat's stability, changing dosage as necessary. Routine x-rays will be taken of the chest, heart and abdomen to check for recurrence and progress. After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort. Use pain medications with caution; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication. Follow all directions carefully. You will need to limit your cat's activity while it heals, setting aside a quiet place for it to rest, away from household activity, children, and other pets. You might consider cage rest for your cat, to limit its physical activity. Your veterinarian will tell you when it is safe for your cat to move about again. Most cats recover well from amputation, and learn to compensate for the lost limb. It is important to monitor your cat's food and water intake while it is recovering. If your cat does not feel up to eating, you may need to use a feeding tube so that it is getting all of the nutrition it needs to completely recover. Your veterinarian will show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist you in setting up a feeding schedule. While your cat is in the process of healing, you may set the litter box up closer to where your cat rests, and make it so that it is easy to get in and out of the box. Each cat is different, and some will survive longer than others, but the average time of survival after surgery is six months. Less than ten percent will survive for one year after surgery.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_botulism,Botulism in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic disease related to ingestion of raw meat and dead animals. The Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin causes spreading weakness, starting in the back legs and ascending to the trunk, front legs, and neck, followed by paralysis of all four limbs. Cats are generally resistant to the more severe effects of this toxin, but in some cases they may become severely ill. Typically, disease conditions occur within a few hours to six days after eating spoiled animal meat that is infected with the Clostridium botulinum type C preformed neurotoxin. Mildly affected cats generally recover over a period of several days with supportive treatment. However, cats that are having difficulties breathing will require intensive care monitoring. In severe cases, paralysis can affect the ability to breath killing the affected animal. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as contact with spoiled meat or dead animals. Your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam of your cat, with standard tests including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count and urinalysis. Blood will also be taken to test for the presence of botulinum toxin in the blood serum. Likewise, your veterinarian may take a stool sample or vomit to test for the the toxin. X-rays of your cat's chest may be taken to check the health of the lungs and upper digestive tract, as this toxin can cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Your veterinarian will treat your cat according to how severely or mildly it is affected by the botulinum toxin. If it is a mild reaction, your cat may be temporarily hospitalized and treated with a urinary catheter and intravenous feeding. However, if your cat is severely affected and is having trouble breathing due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, it will need close monitoring in an intensive care unit. Under these circumstances, your cat will have a stomach tube placed for feeding and will be hooked up to a ventilator to assist its breathing. Regardless of the severity, however, a type C antitoxin will be given to your cat to neutralize the botulinum toxin and prevent further progression. Complete recovery usually takes place over 1 to 3 weeks. Because it is easier to prevent this disease than treat it, you should never allow your cat to eat dead carcasses or spoiled raw meat. If you live in a rural area where this is a possibility, you will need to be on guard, as far as checking your property regularly for the presence of dead animals. Likewise, in an urban area, where cats come into contact with rodents and other foraging animals, you will need to be aware of the symptoms of various diseases that can affect your cat as a result of eating these animals. In addition, you should always feed your cat food that has been thoroughly cooked. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/brachycephalic-airway-syndrome-cats,Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome In Cats,"Brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats is caused by deformities of the facial bones, nares (nostrils), soft palate, trachea, or larynx. Brachy means “short or shortened,” and cephalic refers to the head; thus, brachycephalic is the term given to short-headed or short-faced cats such as the Persian , Himalayan , and Burmese breeds. Not all brachycephalic breeds will develop brachycephalic airway syndrome, but many will. The symptoms of brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats can vary depending on the severity and number of airway problems. Not every brachycephalic cat will have every symptom, but some possible symptoms include: Open-mouth breathing (having to open the mouth to breathe) Increased breathing effort Noisy or raspy breathing Snoring while relaxed or asleep Reverse sneezing (forceful inhalations that sound like short burst of snoring) Coughing or gagging Heat intolerance Exercise intolerance, or collapsing during exercise or play Brachycephalic airway syndrome refers to a specific set of upper airway abnormalities and their resulting symptoms. Possible upper airway abnormalities include: Stenotic nares– Many brachycephalic breeds have small, narrow nares, or nostrils. This narrowing results in restriction of airflow entering the nostrils. This can be dangerous when the cat has an upper respiratory infection , as mucus discharge in the nostrils further blocks air flow. Elongated soft palate– The soft part of the roof of the mouth is called the soft palate, and in brachycephalic breeds, it tends to be longer than normal. This elongation results in partial blockage of the trachea (windpipe) and can cause less airflow into the lungs. Hypoplastic trachea– Some brachycephalic cat breeds can also have a windpipe that is narrower than normal. This narrowing can result in less airflow into the lungs. Everted laryngeal saccules –All cats have small saccules (pouches of tissue) just inside the larynx (voice box). However, in brachycephalic airway syndrome, the saccules evert, or get displaced outward, because of the extra breathing effort caused by the stenotic nares and the elongated soft palate. This eversion of the saccules causes further blockage of airflow. A probable diagnosis of brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats can be made through physical examination alone; a cat’s breed, facial structure, and external physical features can help in the diagnosis. However, to find out the severity of brachycephalic airway syndrome, more testing may be needed. Anesthesia is needed to allow a thorough laryngeal and soft palate exam, as these structures are next to impossible to see well in an awake cat. Your veterinarian will likely recommend pre-anesthetic testing that may include blood tests to check the function of internal organs, chest X-rays to check the heart and lungs, or an EKG to screen for heart abnormalities. Treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome varies depending on severity and quantity of deformed body parts. Regardless of severity, early diagnosis and treatment is ideal, as symptoms tend to worsen the longer brachycephalic airway syndrome goes untreated. In mild cases, a conservative management may be considered by addressing contributing factors such as weight management , avoiding hot or humid conditions, limiting play or exercise, and treating respiratory infections early and aggressively. In some cases, antihistamines may be recommended to help keep airway secretions (mucus) to a minimum. Other medications, such as Onsior ®, may be recommended to treat symptom flare-ups. In more advanced cases, surgery to fix the stenotic nostrils and/or elongated soft palate may be all that is needed to improve airflow and quality of life, especially if treatment is started early on. Some general practitioners are comfortable doing such surgeries, while others may refer their patients to a surgical specialist. Surgical correction of stenotic nostrils is called a rhinoplasty, and it involves removing a part of the nasal tissue to make the opening of the nares bigger to improve airflow. Similarly, surgical correction of an elongated soft palate involves surgically removing a part of the soft palate to improve airflow and stop the risk of tracheal blockage. This surgery is called a staphylectomy. In severe cases, or in cases where treatment has been delayed, surgical removal of the laryngeal saccules may be recommended to further improve airflow. Recovery from surgery can vary depending on the procedure. For stenotic nares correction, recovery is relatively easy. Pain management and preventing rubbing of the nose by using an Elizabethan collar or recovery cone, are typically recommended for about a week after surgery. If surgery involves soft palate removal or laryngeal saccule removal, an overnight stay at a 24-hour care facility may be recommended. Post-op swelling and severe pain can occasionally be a problem after these procedures, and having your cat closely watched is important for safety and proper pain management. Additionally, a soft diet will likely be recommended for the week following surgery. The prognosis for cats with brachycephalic airway syndrome depends on the severity of their symptoms, how many anatomical abnormalities are present, the age at diagnosis, the age at treatment, and the presence of other diseases. Since brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats is congenital (present from birth), and is a result of improperly formed body parts, it can only be prevented by following good breeding practices. Any cat with a history of brachycephalic airway syndrome should not be bred. Likewise, cats with less severe brachycephalic conformation should be favored in any breeding program. The average cost of surgery for the treatment of brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats varies, depending on the number of procedures needed, as well as whether a general practitioner or a specialist is used. Costs can range from $900 to $3,000. The most common symptom in cats with brachycephalic airway syndrome is open-mouth breathing. Open-mouth breathing can look like opening the mouth slightly with each inhalation or exhalation, or it can also look like keeping the mouth open all the time. It is never normal for a cat to breathe with their mouth open for any length of time, and cats who are open-mouth breathing should be examined by a veterinarian right away. Since brachycephalic airway syndrome in cats is congenital (present at birth) and is a result of anatomical abnormalities, it can only be prevented by following good breeding practices. Any cat with a history of brachycephalic airway syndrome should not be bred. Featured Image: iStock.com/Pandini WRITTEN BY Veterinarian Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_meningoencephalomyelitis,"Brain and Spinal Cord Inflammation (Meningoencephalomyelitis, Eosinophilic) in Cats","PetMD Editorial Although rare in cats, eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis is a condition that causes the inflammation of the brain, spinal cord, and their membranes due to abnormally high numbers of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Often, the increase of eosinophils is in response to a parasite infection, tumor or allergic reaction in the cat. Symptoms vary in location and severity, but are often related to the nervous system such as circling, loss of memory, seizures and blindness. It is common for the underlying cause to the eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis to be idiopathic (or unknown) in nature. Other typical factors associated with this disease include: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination and several laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- to help identify and isolate the cause of inflammation. Blood testing may reveal abnormally high number of eiosinophils in the blood. Biochemistry profiling, for example, may show abnormal liver enzyme activity, indicating parasitic infections. And magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal tumorous lesions in the cat's brain or spinal cord. One of the most important diagnostic tests, however, is CSF (or cerebrospinal fluid) analysis. A sample of your cat's CSF will be collected and sent to a laboratory for culturing and further evaluation. In case of idiopathic or allergic causes, abnormally high numbers of eiosinophils are seen in the CSF. Tumors, meanwhile, are generally associated with an abnormally low number of white blood cells along with a small number of eiosinophils in the CSF. Due to the severity of the disease, most cats with eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis will need to be hospitalized. In cases where no underlying cause can be identified (idiopathic), your veterinarian may prescribe steroids for a few weeks to control inflammation. Otherwise, cats are kept on certain diet and movement restrictions until a cause, and more specific treatment regimen, can be found. Overall prognosis heavily depends on the underlying cause of the disease. However, prognosis is good if aggressive treatment is conducted quickly -- most cats will improve within first 72 hours and recover after six to eight weeks. During hospitalization, your cat is often examined every six hours. Post-treatment, the veterinarian may request that you bring the cat for regular follow-up evaluations. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_polioencephalomyelitis,Brain and Spinal Cord Inflammation (Polioencephalomyelitis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Polioencephalomyelitis is a non-suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis(non-draining inflammation of the gray matter of the brain and spinal cord). This condition causes nerve degeneration, and demyelination (degeneration of the sheath surrounding the nerve) of the neurons in the thoracic spinal cord (upper back). Lesions can also be seen in the cervical spinal cord (neck), lumbar spinal cord (lower back), brainstem (base of the brain), and the cerebrum (the largest part of the brain). Polioencephalomyelitis is a viral infection, most likely spread through mucus from the nose and mouth. It is suspected to be caused by the Borna virus, an infection of the brain tissue that affects several mammalian populations, but this is unproven. The cause of this disease has a long documented history, but its origin is generally unknown. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to rule out or confirm other diseases. The doctor may also take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory cellular analysis. You will need to provide a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Steroid therapy may reduce inflammation and improve clinical signs, at least temporarily. There is very little known about this disease. Unfortunately, what is known is that it is a progressive disease with a poor prognosis. Most animals with this disease will need to be euthanized, since the symptoms will only worsen.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_neuroaxonal_dystrophy,Brain Cell Degeneration in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Neuroaxonal dystrophy is a group of inherited abiotrophies affecting different parts of brain. The term abiotrophy is used to denote loss of function due to degeneration of cells or tissues without known reasons. The age at onset varies in different breeds, but it is generally at about five weeks in cats. Symptoms depend on the part of the brain that is affected. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including background history and a descriptions of the onset of symptoms. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these routine laboratory tests are usually within normal ranges. Diagnosis of neuroaxonal dystrophy is usually accomplished by differential diagnosis. That is, by excluding other diseases and conditions until the correct cause for the condition is settled upon. A concrete diagnosis is usually made during postmortem of affected patients. No specific treatment is available to alter the course of this disease. Activity is restricted in affected cats to prevent falls. This disease is not necessarily fatal, but may lead to incapacitation in affected cats. Observe your cat’s activity, and do what you can to make sure that your cat does not injure itself in preventable falls, such as with swimming pools, stairs and open windows.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hepatic_encephalopathy,Brain Disorder Due to Liver Disease in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Encephalopathy is the medical term for any disorder of the brain, and hepatic refers to the liver. Hepatic encephalopathy is a metabolic disorder that affects the central nervous system. It develops secondary to liver disease (known as hepatopathy). Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by an accumulation of ammonia in the system due to the liver's inability to rid the body of the substance. The liver is the largest gland in the body, performing a number of essential functions, including the production of bile (a fluid substance involved in the digestion of fats), production of albumin (a protein in the plasma of the blood), and detoxification of drugs and other chemicals (such as ammonia) in the body. A portosystemic shunt or portosystemic vascular anomaly is a condition in which blood vessels allow blood to flow abnormally between the portal vein (the vein that normally carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver) and into the body's blood circulation without first being filtered through the liver. This condition can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired (a condition that develops sometime later in life). Congenital portosystemic shunt or portosystemic vascular anomaly is genetically inherited in some breeds and will generally present at a young age. With acquired forms of this disease, symptoms can occur at any age. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and any background information you have on your cat's parentage. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, with standard tests including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis so as to rule out other causes of disease. Your veterinarian will use the bloodwork to confirm or rule out impaired kidney function. X-ray and ultrasound imaging will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the liver. Its appearance will change in certain diseased states. If this appears to be the case your veterinarian may take a sample from the liver by aspiration or biopsy in order to reach a conclusive diagnosis. Most patients showing signs of hepatic encephalopathy should be hospitalized. Medications may be prescribed by your veterinarian to help improve dietary protein tolerance, and your cat's diet should be switched to a diet that is designed for liver or kidney disease. Your cat will need to be placed in a protective environment so that activity is restricted. You may want to consider cage rest during the recovery and therapy process. Oxygen therapy and fluid therapy with electrolyte and vitamin supplementation will need to be given to stabilize your cat's health, and you will also need to take care to keep your cat warm while it is recovering. To assure your cat is receiving enough calories, a feeding tube may need to be inserted. Should this be necessary, your veterinarian will go over this process with you for home care. If the source of the liver disease is a congenital shunt, surgical correction may resolve the condition. If the portosystemic shunt was acquired, abnormal blood vessels should not be tied off. Zinc supplementation can be given as needed. Other treatments that may be prescribed are antibiotics, enemas, diuretics and seizure-control medications. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat according to the underlying diseased state. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat's symptoms return or worsen, if your cat loses weight, or if your cat begins to look unwell. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_encephalitis_secondary_to_parasitic_migration,Brain Inflammation Due to Parasitic Infection in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Also known as encephalitis , brain inflammation may be due to a variety of factors. Parasites, for instance, can migrate into the cat's central nervous system (CNS), gain entry via blood or through adjacent tissues, including the middle ear, natural opening in the skull, nasal cavities and cribriform plate (part of the skull), or open fontanelles, also called “soft spots.” These parasites may normally affect another organ system of the same host (e.g., Dirofilaria immitis , Taenia , Ancylostoma caninum , Angiostrongylus ), or a different host species (e.g., raccoon roundworm, Baylisascaris procyonis ; skunk roundworm, B. columnaris ; Coenurus spp. , or Cysticercus cellulosae ). Dirofilaria immitis is most often seen in adult cats, while the other parasites generally infect younger kittens that are exposed to the outdoors. Symptoms associated with this type of encephalitis will vary depending on the portion of CNS affected. Cuterebriasis, for example, occurs mainly between July and October in the U.S. and is characterized by the sudden onset of behavior changes, seizures, and vision issues. In addition, parasite infections are often asymmetrical, affecting one side but not the other. The most common way a cat acquires this type of encephalitis is by being housed in a cage that has been previously occupied by an infected host; e.g., raccoons, skunks. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal unless the parasites have also migrated into other organs. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain may reveal a focal lesion and/or cerebral tissue death from blockage of cerebral blood vessels, both of which are consistent with parasitic infections. A cerebrospinal fluid tap is another common diagnostic method used to confirm parasitic infection; however, the tap may yield normal results despite encephalitis. Medication such as anthelmintics (dewormers) may be used to kill off the parasites, but they may also lead to other complications. Consult your veterinarian for the best course of treatment. Kittens with a mild form of angiostrongylosis may even recover fully with just supportive care and corticosteroid therapy. In other cases, surgical removal of intercranial parasites (e.g., Cuterebra) may be necessary. Most parasitic infections of the central nervous system are incurable and progress in severity. To prevent your cat from contracting such infections keep it indoors and away from wild animals. Dewormers, anthelmintics, and dirofilaricides can also prevent infection. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_brain_injury,Brain Injury in Cats,"PetMD Editorial There are a variety of things that can cause brain injuries in cats, including severe hyperthermia or hypothermia and prolonged seizures. Primary brain injuries, for example, involve direct trauma to the brain, which once acquired, cannot be altered. Secondary brain injury, meanwhile, is the alteration of brain tissue that occurs after primary injury, but this form of injury can be managed, prevented, and improved with optimal supportive care and treatment. Being that it is a vital organ, the brain requires constant supply of oxygen and nutrition. Any deficiency of oxygen or direct trauma to the brain, therefore, may result in bleeding and fluid buildup, which can cause excessive pressure on the brain. This in turn can cause complications involving the heart, eye, and several other body systems. Symptoms vary and depend on the cause and severity of the brain injury. Some of the more common symptoms include: The following are some of the more common causes to brain injuries: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated the unusual behaviors or complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count. Although the findings for these tests depend on the underlying cause of the brain injury, often the biochemistry profile may indicate abnormalities in the blood glucose level. Blood gases are also measured to confirm oxygen deficiency in the blood. When fractures involving the skull are suspected, X-rays, CT (computed tomography) scans, and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) are extremely useful to evaluate the severity of the brain trauma. These diagnostic tools also help in determining the presence of bleeding, fractures, foreign bodies, tumor, and other abnormalities involving brain. The ECG (electrocardiogram), meanwhile, is used to evaluate heart functions and rhythm. Lastly, your veterinarian may collect cerebrospinal fluid sample to determine the level of inflammation and to confirm possible infections. Any type of brain injury should be considered an emergency that requires immediate hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. In fact, depending on the cause of the brain injury, surgery may be required. However, often the primary goal of emergency treatment is to normalize the cat's temperature and blood pressure, provide adequate levels of oxygen and prevent hypoxia. In order to assist with breathing, a tube will be passed into the trachea to supply oxygen. Small amounts of fluids may also be given to animals with fluid deficits in order to maintain blood pressure. To reduce brain swelling, the cat will be given medication and its head will be kept above the level of the body. In addition, the cat is turned over every two hours to avoid complications. Pain killers are often provided to reduce pain associated with the injury. Those with severe hemorrhaging (either in the eye or in the brain) will also be given medication. In cases with low blood glucose levels, intravenous glucose supplementation is initiated, whereas in cats with high blood glucose levels, insulin may be required to reduce blood glucose levels. For cats with minimal primary or secondary brain injuries, the overall prognosis is good. In fact, if no deterioration is observed within 48 hours following the head injury, the cat has a good chance of full recovery, which may take more than six months, depending on the cause and treatment of the condition. During the recovery process, your cat should be placed in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children. Tube feeding may be necessary for the first few weeks for nutritional support. In addition, its activities should be restricted until the veterinarian advises otherwise. It is important you watch your cat for any untoward symptoms such as unusual behaviors, bleeding, vomiting, and inform the veterinarian if any should occur immediately. Otherwise, the cat is brought in for regular follow-up exams to evaluate the neurologic functions of the patient. Frequent laboratory testing may also be required to determine the cat's overall health. Unfortunately, cats suffering from severe primary head injuries and/or secondary brain traumas, the overall prognosis is not favorable. Image: Telekhovskyi via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_astrocytoma,Brain Tumor (Astrocytoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Although rare in cats, astrocytomas can be dangerous, even deadly. These tumors affect the brain's glial cells, which surround nerve cells (neurons), giving them support and electrically insulating them. Astrocytomas can also be rarely found in the spinal cord, and there was one reported case of an astrocytoma located in the retina. The astrocytoma's biologic behavior depends on the tumor's location and degree of lack of cell differentiation (graded I–IV, from best to worst prognosis). The following are some common symptoms associated with this type of brain tumor : The underlying cause for the development of astrocytomas is currently unknown. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to rule out other diseases. An analysis of cerebrospinal fluid may indicate increased protein levels without an increase in cell count, which is indicative of astrocytoma development. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also highly instrumental in diagnosing astrocytomas, as is radionuclide imaging, which may show an area of increased activity at the tumor site. Surgery and chemotherapy are both common courses of treatment when dealing with this time of brain tumor. Radiation therapy, too, can be effective; consult a veterinary oncologist if this is beneficial in the case of your cat. Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments for your pet, where it will undergo CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, so as to monitor the cat's response to treatment. Likewise, blood work (especially a complete blood count) should be evaluated during each appointment. If the cat was prescribed seizure medication, your veterinarian may want to evaluate it earlier (7 to 10 days after prescribing the medication) to regulate the dosage accordingly.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/brain-tumors-cats,Brain Tumors in Cats,"Brain tumors are made up of abnormal cells that either develop within the brain (primary tumors) or originate elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain (secondary tumors). Brain tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) . A brain tumor looks like a mass within a section of the brain. As the tumor grows, it may either invade a cat’s brain or press against it, leading to increased intracranial pressure, inflammation, and damage to healthy brain tissue. Primary brain tumors are known to account for less than 2% of tumors in cats. However, the low incidence may mislead because many go undiagnosed. Diagnosis requires advanced imaging, which is often declined by pet parents due to cost. The most common brain tumor in cats is a benign tumor called a meningioma. Other common brain tumors in cats include gliomas, lymphosarcoma (lymphoma), choroid plexus papillomas, and pituitary tumors. Brain tumors can be a medical emergency due to concerning symptoms, such as seizures , sudden blindness , or difficulty walking . If your cat is displaying any of these symptoms, take them to the nearest emergency hospital as soon as possible. Symptoms of brain tumors can vary based on where the tumor is located within a cat’s brain, and may include: Lethargy Weight loss Change in personality Blindness Misaligned eyes (strabismus) Restlessness Weakness in all four limbs (tetraparesis) Vocalization Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus) Muscle spasms causing the head, neck, or back to arch backward (opisthotonus) Walking in circles Lack of coordination Loss of balance Difficulty swallowing Difficulty breathing Head tilt Seizures Head tremors Paralysis Coma It’s unknown what causes brain tumors to develop in cats. There are some theories that certain factors— such as pH abnormalities (brain tissue becomes too acidic or too alkaline), metabolic imbalances (altered metabolism), or cerebral edema (swelling of the brain)—may play a role in the development of brain tumors, but these theories have yet to be proven. Cats over 10 years of age are more likely to have a brain tumor than younger cats. One study showed an increase in meningiomas in domestic short-haired cats, while another study showed a higher incidence in Siamese cats . Some researchers also found a higher incidence of meningiomas in male cats. However, further studies are needed to confirm these results. If your veterinarian suspects a brain tumor, they may use a combination of tests to reach an accurate diagnosis, including: Medical history —It’s important to let your veterinarian know about any symptoms your cat has been displaying at home. Physical exam —In addition to a thorough physical exam, your veterinarian will perform a focused neurologic exam. Any neurologic abnormalities they detect can help them localize the problem to a specific part of the brain. However, a normal neurologic exam does not rule out a brain tumor. Blood work and urinalysis —These routine tests will screen for diseases affecting the entire body and determine if a cat can safely undergo anesthesia and surgery. Advanced imaging —To accurately diagnose a brain tumor, an MRI or CT scan of the brain is required, which involves the cat being placed under general anesthesia. An MRI is preferred because it provides more detail. Biopsy —A CT-guided biopsy, which involves obtaining a small sample of the brain tumor with the aid of CT imaging, may be used to determine the type of tumor. Treatment of a brain tumor varies based on the type of tumor, location, and whether cancer is found in other areas of the body as well. Treatment options may include surgery ($4,000–$7,000), chemotherapy ($2,000–$4,000), and/or radiation ($6,000–$9,000). The entire tumor can sometimes be surgically removed, but this is often difficult because healthy brain tissue would also need to be removed for the operation to be successful. The more brain tissue that is surgically removed, the more likely it is that neurologic problems will occur after surgery. Some meningiomas can be successfully removed with surgery, which can extend a cat’s life by up to three years, but the tumor may also regrow. Chemotherapy can be administered in addition to surgery or as a solo treatment option. Lymphoma is one type of brain tumor that typically improves with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is often an alternative option to surgery, and it can sometimes improve a cat’s quality of life for months. When cats undergo surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, they often require hospitalization. The amount of time a cat is hospitalized depends on the type of treatment used. Unfortunately, most brain tumors are not curable because they are not easily accessible. Treatment is not pursued for most cats due to cost, poor prognosis, the age of the cat, and complications that can occur. Cats who do not receive treatment often die or are humanely euthanized shortly after diagnosis. Medications that may be prescribed for cats with brain tumors include: Chemotherapy drugs, such as cyclophosphamide , prednisolone , and doxorubicin, for treatment of lymphoma Anticonvulsant medications, such as levetiracetam and zonisamide , to manage seizures Prednisone, for management of cerebral edema or as a palliative treatment option Mannitol, hypertonic saline, or furosemide , to manage edema and reduce intracranial pressure Recovery from a brain tumor takes time and is dependent upon the success of treatment and how the cat responds. If a cat undergoes surgery to remove a brain tumor, the following complications can occur from the surgery or anesthesia: Blindness Progression of neurologic symptoms Blood loss Acute kidney failure After treatment, frequent neurologic exams and blood work will be recommended to monitor the cat’s recovery. Frequent MRI or CT scans may be recommended to assess the size of the tumor and to screen for recurrence of a tumor after surgical removal . Cats may stay on anticonvulsant medications (like levetiracetam and zonisamide) long-term to reduce the risk for seizure activity. If your cat has seizures, keeping a log of any seizure activity can be helpful in monitoring recovery. Make note of the day and time a seizure occurs, how long it lasts, and how long it takes for your cat to return to normal after the seizure. Make sure to follow up with your veterinarian when any new seizures occur. Currently, there is no way to prevent a brain tumor from developing in a cat. Routine wellness exams are very important, because a veterinarian may find abnormalities during the neurologic exam and recommend additional diagnostic tests. If treatment is not pursued, a cat can live a few weeks to months depending on the type of tumor and its location. Euthanasia should be pursued if a cat’s quality of life is poor, such as if the cat has frequent seizures, difficulty walking, difficulty breathing, lethargy, and/or is barely eating or drinking . Humane euthanasia prevents further suffering and allows for a cat to die peacefully. Yes. Brain tumors are often painful because they invade brain tissue or press against it, which causes increased intracranial pressure. High pressure within the brain can lead to severe headaches and vomiting. Featured Image: AzmanL/E+ via Getty Images Beaumont A, Whittle IR: The pathogenesis of tumour associated epilepsy .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_dyspnea_tachypnea_panting,Heavy Breathing in Cats,"Difficulty breathing is always found near the top of lists of health emergencies in cats. There are two reasons for this: Here are a few important things to know about heavy breathing in cats: Heavy breathing is a catch-all term. Let’s look at some of the specific types of breathing and what that could mean. Cat Panting – Unlike dogs, cats do not pant to cool themselves off unless they are seriously overheated. If your cat is panting after playing, for example, that is almost never normal. Cats will sometimes pant when they are extremely stressed , and though this may not sound dangerous, you should try to figure out why they are stressed and what you can do to improve the situation. Cat Wheezing – Wheezes are high-pitched sounds usually heard when a cat exhales. They can be signs of a partial airway blockage, such as the airway narrowing associated with feline asthma . Cat Breathing Fast – Cats will breathe fast when they aren’t getting enough oxygen or getting rid of enough carbon dioxide. Exercise may cause a cat to breathe rapidly, but they should quickly return to normal with rest. Many conditions can cause a cat to breathe fast, including lung disease, conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract, heart disease, metabolic conditions (uncontrolled diabetes , for example), disorders affecting the blood, high body temperature, pain, or stress. Cat With Labored Breathing – Cats with respiratory problems may also try to compensate by taking deeper breaths. If you watch closely, you can often see that they are working hard to breathe. Open-Mouth Breathing in Cats – Cats are designed to breathe through their noses. Open-mouth breathing can be a sign that they can’t pass air through their nose or that they are really struggling to breathe. Cat Sounds Congested When Breathing – Nasal congestion is a common symptom of upper respiratory infections in cats, but you’ll usually also see nasal discharge. If your cat sounds “gurgly” but their nose looks normal, the congestion may be in the lungs, which could be a symptom of pneumonia, heart disease, or another serious health problem. Cat Breathing Loudly (Noisy, Raspy) – Noisy breathing usually occurs when air is forced past an abnormally narrow area in the respiratory tract. This can happen with problems affecting the nasal passages, pharynx (back of the nose and mouth), trachea, or small airways. Cat Breathing Heavily While Resting – The only time that heavy breathing in cats is normal is after strenuous exercise. Breathing heavily while resting, other than the occasional deep sigh, is seen with dangerous health problems, like heart failure or severe lung disease. Cat With Shallow Breathing – A healthy cat’s breathing may look shallow, particularly when they’re resting. But shallow breathing isn’t normal if it’s associated with other symptoms, like open-mouth, rapid, or labored breathing. Cat With Abdominal Breathing – A cat’s abdomen will move a little bit with normal breathing, but they shouldn’t have to use their abdominal muscles to breathe. This is a sign of labored breathing in cats. Never ignore heavy breathing in cats. Unless your cat has just run a few laps around the house or experienced something stressful (and they quickly return to normal), make an appointment with your veterinarian. If your cat’s symptoms are severe, you should see a veterinarian immediately, even if it means a middle-of-the-night trip to the emergency hospital. Cats who are having big problems breathing can be near collapse. Stay calm, but quickly get them into a carrier and to a nearby veterinarian. There are many causes of heavy breathing in cats, most of which pose a significant threat to their well-being. Asthma and Chronic Bronchitis – Cats with asthma and an associated condition, chronic bronchitis , often display labored breathing, wheezing, and coughing. Cancer – Many types of cancer can affect a cat’s respiratory system. Heartworms – Cats can develop heartworm disease after being bitten by a mosquito that is infected with larval Dirofilaria immitis parasites. Infections – Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms can lead to upper respiratory infections, tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. Heart Disease – Heart problems can adversely affect blood circulation, cause fluid to build up in or around the lungs, and result in heart enlargement, all of which can cause heavy breathing in cats. Fluid or Gas Around the Lungs – Accumulation of blood, pus, chyle (a fatty liquid), and other fluids or gas in the chest cavity makes it hard for the lungs to expand. Trauma – Injuries to the chest can obviously cause breathing problems, but so can injuries to other parts of the body that result in pain, bleeding, neurologic dysfunction, or movement of abdominal organs into the chest cavity. Toxins and Drugs – Poisons that affect blood clotting can lead to bleeding and heavy breathing. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) should never be given to cats because it damages their red blood cells’ ability to carry oxygen. Other reactions to toxins and drugs can also make it hard for cats to breathe. Foreign Objects – Cats can inhale things that become lodged in airways and prevent normal breathing. The veterinarian may need to stabilize your cat with oxygen therapy or other treatments before the search for an underlying problem can begin. When it’s safe to do so, the veterinarian will perform a full physical exam and ask you questions about your cat’s health, lifestyle, and the symptoms you have been seeing at home. Unless the underlying problem is obvious—for example, you saw your cat eat a bunch of Tylenol— the vet will probably need to run some diagnostic tests to get to the bottom of the situation. These may include: Blood chemistry panel Complete blood cell count Urinalysis Fecal examination Special lab tests based on the specifics of the case (serology to identify infectious diseases, for example) Chest x-rays Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiogram) and other parts of the body Taking and analyzing samples of fluid or tissue Blood pressure measurement The treatment will depend on the specific cause of your cat’s heavy breathing: Asthma and Chronic Bronchitis –Veterinarians can prescribe medications that decrease inflammation and dilate airways. It’s also helpful to eliminate or reduce triggers like secondhand smoke, dusty cat litter, strong scents, and allergies that make a cat’s asthma worse. Cancer – Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, palliative care, and other forms of treatment can prolong a cat’s life and improve their well-being. Heartworms – Heartworm prevention is important for cats because treating heartworm disease is difficult and not always successful. Infections – Veterinarians may prescribe antibiotics for bacterial infections, antifungal medications for fungal infections, and sometimes antiviral treatments for viral infections. Heart Disease – Medications can help improve heart function, reduce the buildup of fluid, and manage high blood pressure. Fluid or Gas Around the Lungs – A chest tap or chest tube can quickly improve a cat’s ability to breathe. Trauma – Cage rest, pain relief, blood transfusions, and surgery may all be part of a cat’s treatment plan. Toxins and Drugs – Treatment will depend on the specific toxin or drug involved. Foreign Objects – A veterinarian can remove foreign material from a cat’s airways using an endoscope or with surgery. Supportive care in a veterinary hospital is also an essential part of treating many cases of heavy breathing in cats. This may involve rest, nursing care, oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, or nutritional support. Once your cat can continue their recuperation at home, they should stay indoors and be closely monitored. Call your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, the sooner the cause of a cat’s heavy breathing is diagnosed and treated, the better the chances of a speedy recovery.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/c_ct_breeding_timing,Breeding Timing in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Breeding timing refers to a technique that may be utilized to ensure conception in cats by the purposeful timing of insemination during the estrus (heat) period. A fertile female cat is referred to as a queen. In order to maximize the odds of conception with properly timed breeding, it is best to pin-point, as close as possible, the day of ovulation for the queen. Symptoms of estrus in the queen are evident by her rubbing against objects, being vocal (much more than usual), and an interest shown by the male cat. However, timing of breeding is less critical with cats and ultimately depends on the amount of luteinizing hormone (LH) released, which is triggered via stimulation of the queen’s vagina and cervix. Breeding timing and related fertility-maximizing techniques may be utilized for a number of reasons. This may be deemed necessary if there is an apparent failure to achieve conception in the queen. For cats, the most reliable method of determining the ovulation cycle is by progesterone testing. In order to maximize odds of conception in cats, the number of matings should be increased by breeding on successive days. The timing is not as important for cats (as opposed to dogs), as simple stimulation of the vagina and cervix increases the amount of LH released. Breeding four times a day at least two to three hours apart on the second and third days of estrus will maximize LH release and improve the odds of conception. Progesterone testing can verify the queen’s ovulation. After initial fertility-maximizing measures have been taken, a follow up pregnancy examination can be performed to determine the success of the procedure. This can be done by measuring the progesterone levels in your cat. The gestation period for cats lasts from 63 to 66 days. Age related factors may make conception more difficult for older animals.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/broken-bones-cats,Broken Bones in Cats,"Bones in cats are structurally similar to those in humans. They provide support for body movement and protect internal structures like organs. Bones also contain marrow, where new red and white blood cells are created. Although cats are usually graceful animals, they don’t always land on their feet and as a result may break a bone. Breaks or fractures in cats happen mostly after falling, getting stepped on, getting hit by a car, or being attacked by a larger animal. Fractures of the femur (thighbone) are the most common in cats. Tibia (shinbone) fractures are next, followed by pelvis, jawbone, paw, and tail fractures. Breaks are generally classified by type of bone, area of bone, severity (how many bone pieces broken), and pattern (angle) of fracture. Cats are strong predators and are good at concealing their pain. This can make it difficult to care for a sick or injured cat. Most cats that have broken bones show at least subtle signs of discomfort. Some of the symptoms to look out for are: Vocalization : crying, grunting, increased meowing, or growling Change in movement : not walking as much or at all, not putting weight on a specific limb, not flicking their tail, or holding their tail limply Change in behavior : not wanting to jump, stretch, or scratch as they normally do; not grooming themselves, or growling and hissing when petted Decreased appetite : avoiding food may indicate a broken jaw or pain in getting to their food bowl Swelling or bruising Other injuries : cuts, scrapes, or bruises in areas where an injury may have occurred If you suspect your cat has a broken bone, make sure that you are safe when interacting with them. No matter how gentle your cat normally is, when in pain any cat can bite. Severe breaks and injuries can cause your cat to go into shock. If your cat collapses, is having convulsions, has pale or blue gums, or is breathing with their mouth open, take them to an emergency veterinarian immediately. Cover any area that is bleeding or where there is visible bone with a clean cloth. Then wrap your cat carefully in a towel or blanket and take them for treatment. Do not try to set any broken bones yourself . Bones should be disturbed as little as possible until your cat is examined by the vet. Try to keep other pets and children away from your injured cat. How fractures are treated depends on the location and type of fracture and the bone that was broken. Other factors include your cat’s age, weight, and overall health, how old the injury is, and if other injuries are present. Veterinarians treat broken bones using the following methods: Splints/casts are used to stabilize certain fractures where the joints above and below the fracture can be immobilized. Splints and casts require weekly bandage changes by your veterinarian. Surgery may be needed to realign bones. Rods, plates, screws, or wires are used to stabilize the fracture or hold misplaced bones in a stable position. All open fractures, where broken bone is visible through a wound, require surgical repair. Amputation may be considered with very severe fractures. It may be recommended as the fastest way to get your pet healthy and pain-free. Fortunately, most cats do well with amputation of a limb or tail and return to normal faster than those that had stabilization surgery. Crate/cage rest is needed for some simple fractures, where the bones are still normally aligned. These can be treated by severely restricting movement. This option can have side effects, which your veterinarian can explain to you. If surgery or amputation is needed to treat your cat, you may be referred to a veterinary surgeon. Regardless of the type of repair or treatment, your cat will need rest following a fracture. Your veterinarian will tell you the length and kind of rest your pet will need. It is often recommended that you remove toys, cat trees, and other items that encourage movement until your cat is cleared for normal activity. Cats with a broken bone usually also need pain and anti-inflammatory medication while they recuperate at home, and open fractures generally also require treatment with antibiotics. If your cat has a cast or splint, keep the bandage material clean and dry. Splints also require regular bandage changes; but if it becomes wet or dirty, it should be changed sooner. Bandage changes must be done by your veterinarian; the process can be painful for your cat and sedation may be needed. Cats that have had bone surgery and those that have casts or splints will most likely be given an Elizabethan collar to prevent them from chewing on their stitches or bandages. Broken bones in cats typically heal in 6-12 weeks depending on the type of fracture, its location, your cat’s age and health, and the treatment rendered. Cats that are older, are overweight or obese, have other medical issues such as diabetes or heart disease, or have complex fractures usually take longer to heal. Your veterinarian will recommend periodic x-rays to monitor the healing process. Harasen G. Common long bone fractures in small animal practice—Part 1.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/bronchitis-in-cats,Bronchitis in Cats: Signs and When To Call Your Vet,"Luis D. Barrera Gamboa/E+ via Getty Images If your cat has a wheeze or cough , they may be suffering from bronchitis. Bronchitis is often associated with feline asthma and can be a component of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Bronchitis in cats can typically be managed at home—with your veterinarian’s guidance—using medications and a few changes to your cat’s environment. Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi, the airways in the lungs. Imagine a cat’s airways like a tree with branches. The trachea, or windpipe, is similar to the tree trunk, and it branches into mainstem bronchi, which feed into each lung. Inside the lungs, the bronchi continue to branch smaller and smaller. These tiny airways are what get inflamed in cats with bronchitis. When the airways become inflamed this can cause a wheezing noise when the cat breathes, and sometimes a cough. There is less room for air to travel through the airways, and less oxygen is exchanged, making it harder for them to run, jump, and play without getting winded. This inflammation may become severe enough that it’s extremely difficult for your cat to breathe. If your cat is open-mouth breathing or appears to be struggling to get a breath, this is a medical emergency. If you do not already have a rescue inhaler on hand, get your cat to the nearest emergency vet for treatment. Common symptoms of bronchitis in cats include: Coughing Wheezing Decreased energy ( lethargy ) Exercise intolerance Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath Open-mouth breathing (emergency) Blue tinge to gums/tongue (emergency) Bronchitis is most common in young and middle-aged cats. Siamese cats have an increased risk of feline asthma and bronchitis. Cats who are overweight or who have severe dental disease are also at increased risk. Additionally, cats who are allowed outdoors and are not on regular parasite prevention are more likely to contract heartworm disease , which can lead to bronchitis. Heartworm disease in cats can also inflame the airways, a condition known as HARD (heartworm-associated respiratory disease). Fortunately, many cats’ immune systems kill heartworms and eliminate them from the body before they mature into adults in the heart (as they do in dogs ). However, immature heartworms can still damage the lungs before the cat’s body gets rid of them, leading to inflammation and chronic signs that are consistent with bronchitis and asthma. The exact cause of bronchitis isn’t known, but several things can trigger asthma-like flare-ups. Inhaled irritants may inflame the lining of an affected cat’s airways, leading to symptoms. Inhaled irritants that may lead to flare-ups include: Air fresheners Plug-ins Perfume E ssential-oils and diffusers Scented laundry products Pollens Mildew Mold To diagnose bronchitis in cats, your vet will start by thoroughly examining your pet’s chest by listening to their lungs and airways with a stethoscope. They will likely want to take X-rays , as they’re one of the easiest ways to diagnose bronchitis. Your vet may recommend additional testing, such as heartworm testing and a fecal float to look for parasites that can affect the lungs . Blood work may be performed to screen for signs of infection or an underlying condition, and to make sure your cat’s organs are healthy before starting medications. Talk to your veterinarian before your cat’s appointment to find out if your pet needs to fast (have food withheld). When you see your cat coughing or wheezing, try to record a video to share with your vet. Most cases of bronchitis are managed rather than cured. Anti-inflammatory steroids are often prescribed to help open your cat’s airways and make their breathing easier. Steroids can be prescribed as inhalers or oral medications. Inhaled steroids are usually more expensive than pills, but they are easier on your cat’s body long term. Learn about CarePlus, insurance plans with exclusive Chewy benefits Pet insurance that can cover Rx costs and more To give a cat inhaled steroids, a spacer such as the AeroKat Feline Aerosol Chamber is used so your cat can inhale the full dose while breathing normally. Fluticasone is the most prescribed inhaled steroid. A bronchodilator inhaler such as albuterol (a “rescue” medication) may also be prescribed to help open the airways during flare-ups. If your cat won’t tolerate an inhaler or it is too cost-prohibitive, these medications come in oral form as well. Prednisolone will typically be offered as an oral steroid to manage bronchitis and feline asthma. After symptoms are controlled, your veterinarian will guide you to taper down to the lowest effective dose. If your cat won’t take pills, prednisolone can be compounded into a flavored liquid or a transdermal preparation that you rub on their ear flap. Albuterol can also be given by mouth if needed. Heartworm-positive cats may benefit from doxycycline , an antibiotic that is effective against Wolbachia bacteria commonly associated with heartworms. Research is currently underway to look at the relationship between these bacteria and chronic inflammation in the lungs of affected cats. Avoiding known triggers is an important part of managing bronchitis in cats. Using the following tips can help keep your cat healthy and comfortable: Don’t use any aerosolized or strongly scented products in your home. Air fresheners, essential-oil diffusers, and plug-ins should not be used in the home. Consider a high-quality air purifier with a HEPA filter (such as the Shark Air Purifier MAX with True HEPA) to reduce air pollutants and allergens. Have family members take their shoes off at the door to reduce tracking pollen into your home. Avoid dusty, clay litters that may irritate your cat’s airways. Try not to use scented litter or laundry detergents. Consider crystal litter, like PrettyLitter , or pelleted recycled-paper litter, like Fresh News . If you really need a clumping litter, choose one that is both unscented and low-dust, such as Dr. Elsey’s R&R Respiratory Relief cat litter . Some cats diagnosed with feline bronchitis and asthma may benefit from a hypoallergenic diet , especially if food sensitivities are suspected. Diet therapy can take time to be helpful in these cats, but reducing allergen exposure may help decrease inflammation. Examples of a true hypoallergenic diet include Royal Canin HP or Hill’s z/d . Always ask your veterinarian which diet is appropriate for your cat. While genetics play a role in whether a cat will develop bronchitis, weight management can help reduce the risk. Keep your cat at a healthy body condition and avoid letting them become overweight. Consider monthly parasite prevention , especially if your cat goes outdoors. Revolution Plus and NexGard COMBO are examples of products that protect against heartworms, several intestinal parasites, fleas, and ticks. Yes. With appropriate management, most cats with bronchitis can live long, full, high-quality lives. No. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs, whereas bronchitis is airway inflammation. Bronchitis frequently occurs without any bacteria or viral infection and is more commonly associated with inhaled allergens (as in feline asthma) or chronic inflammation following exposure to heartworms. However, cats with pneumonia will often have bronchitis as well because the airways can become inflamed while fighting the infection. Reducing stress and minimizing inhaled irritants can be helpful in accelerating recovery from an upper respiratory infection. Your veterinarian may prescribe medications if needed. Litter dust can act as a trigger that leads to bronchitis symptoms in susceptible cats. Little, S. Coughing cats: Asthma or heartworm? DVM360.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/bulging-eyes-cats,Bulging Eyes in Cats,"The orbit is the eye socket where the eyeball, or globe, and associated tissues (glands, nerves, vessels, and those muscles responsible for eye movement) are housed. The orbit is considered a fixed space. That means anything that would increase its volume or affect the eyeball would cause displacement—often causing the globe to be pushed forward, resulting in a “bulging” eye. This can often be described as one of the following: Buphthalmos —the globe is in a normal position but is enlarged; this is often attributed to glaucoma . One or both eyes can be affected. Exophthalmos­ —the globe itself is normal-sized but protrudes forward. Usually only one eye is affected. Proptosis —sudden, often traumatic, displacement of the globe, which is displaced outward from the eye socket. As a result, the eyelid gets trapped or stuck behind the globe. Orbital disease is the umbrella term for anything that would affect this area. Cats have more bone surrounding their orbit, so the disease is less common than in dogs and often requires some form of surgical treatment. If bulging eyes are noted, have your cat examined immediately by a veterinarian. This is considered an emergency, and since there are multiple causes of eye protrusion, treatment would vary based on diagnosis. The main symptom of cats with bulging eyes is that the eye itself bulges or protrudes outward from the globe. Cats can also exhibit other symptoms associated with this condition or as a result, including: Severe symptoms may include: Bulging eyes in cats can be due to various underlying conditions including: Abscess formation, caused by bacterial infection, fungal infection, or foreign bodies Inflammation or autoimmune disease Vehicular trauma or trauma experienced from falling, fighting, dog attacks, or abuse (it’s important to note that given a cat’s anatomy, severe trauma is often required to cause proptosis) Disease Dental disease ; tooth root abscess Cancer Swelling of salivary glands Bulging eyes can occur in any cats of any breeds, however, younger, unneutered male cats may have a higher incidence of trauma-related proptosis due to territorial and mating behavior. After a complete physical exam, your veterinarian may perform a more in-depth ophthalmic exam followed by orbital palpation to determine if the globe is able to be pushed back in. Ocular tests may be performed, such as a Schirmer Tear Test to measure tear production, a fluorescein eye stain to look for corneal ulcerations and abrasions, or an intraocular pressure (IOP) test to measure pressure within the eye. Symptoms can mimic other diseases, so your veterinarian may recommend basic blood work like a complete blood cell count (CBC), internal organ function screening, blood pressure, FeLV / FIV / HWT testing, thyroid evaluation, and urinalysis. The results from these tests provide a baseline and can also aid surgical and anesthetic planning and rule out other conditions. Additionally, your veterinarian may examine the oral cavity looking for any signs of dental disease, such as infected teeth, swelling of the gums or tissues, or discharge. Your vet may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist for specialized procedures such as an ocular ultrasound or CT and MRI to look at structures behind the eye, assist with surgical planning, and to aid in diagnosis. X-rays of the chest coupled with X-rays or ultrasound of the abdomen may be done to look for evidence of tumor spread (metastasis). Treatment for bulging eyes in cats may be surgical (proptosis, cancer, dental disease, trauma, foreign body) or medical (infectious, inflammatory) depending on the diagnosis. For any displaced eye, the sooner it can be put back in the place the better. However, given a cat’s orbital bony structure, if proptosis is the underlying cause, it usually carries a less favorable outcome due to the severity of trauma encountered, and enucleation is often performed. Enucleation is the surgical removal of the eyeball and its associated tissues. Enucleation is often performed in cases where: The eye has ruptured Three or more eye muscles are ruptured or torn The eye has filled with blood A tumor is diagnosed The pet parent is unable or cannot commit to potential long-term care In some cases, the eye can be salvaged but the prognosis for vision is poor. In these cases, once the cat is stabilized, they are anesthetized and surgical replacement of the globe back into the orbit is performed. A temporary tarsorrhaphy (surgical closure of the eyelids) is performed, and frequent ocular (and oral) medications are then administered to aid swelling, inflammation, pain, and infection. Consultation and treatment of cancer with a veterinary oncologist for chemotherapy and radiation therapeutic recommendations may be necessary, depending on the diagnosis. After surgery, your cat should be kept in a calm and stress-free environment with time given for a chance to acclimate, especially for those cats who underwent an enucleation. Partially blind cats can still have a good quality of life with little inconvenience to their pet parents. Sutures will most likely be present, which will need to be removed in a few weeks. It’s also normal for there to be some swelling and bruising, which should dissipate after a few days. Your cat will be sent home with medications and an e-collar or recovery cone to prevent their scratching or rubbing at the incision. Follow your veterinarian's advice and reach out if there are any concerns or further symptoms noted. Sometimes there is residual bleeding or draining from the surgical site, which will need to be addressed. Your veterinarian may recommend compresses to help with the swelling, along with recommendations for exercise restriction or cage rest. For cats that underwent a tarsorrhaphy or other procedure, recovery will be dependent on their case. Weekly follow-up visits will ensure proper tension of the temporary sutures, along with monitoring for any signs of recurrence of vision. A complete recovery may take several months and some conditions can take longer to see improvement. Medications will vary and may be given frequently during recovery. Your cat may require a special diet or at least need soft food for the first few weeks without any access to chew toys, especially if they underwent a dental procedure. Long-term complications can occur, such as dry eye or corneal ulceration . Follow-up appointments and tests may also be required. Early diagnosis and treatment are key and often minimize pain and discomfort and provide a better prognosis. Monitor your cat closely for any changes to the eyes, and if so, have them examined right away. Keeping your cat indoors, away from high-energy dogs and cats, and providing it with routine medical and dental care can lessen the chances of developing eye protrusion. Bulging eyes can be painful to cats, and it will most certainly affect their quality of life. Any swelling or protrusion of your cat’s eye should prompt immediate veterinary attention. Unfortunately, no. Left untreated, your cat will suffer not only from the physical pain and discomfort of a bulging eye but can also suffer from its consequences such as cancer metastasis, sepsis, osteomyelitis (bone infection), or neurologic disease. There are many causes for a bulging eye, so your veterinarian will recommend a series of tests for a proper diagnosis. Effective treatment can include surgery, but some cats may be treated with medications. In some situations with cats that have a poor prognosis of lack of vision, removal of the eye may be recommended. Featured Image: iStock.com/dardespot Attali-Soussay, K; Jegou, J-P; Clerc B.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pulmonary_mineralizations,Calcium Buildup in Lungs of Cats,"PetMD Editorial When a cat's lungs begin to calcify (a buildup of the mineral calcium in the soft tissue) or ossify (connective tissues, such as cartilage, are turned to bone or bone-like tissue) it is referred to as pulmonary mineralization. This condition generally affects older cats and it may be generalized or localized. But if the mineralization is discrete, meaning that it is in only one place, individual mineral deposits can be identified. If mineralization is diffuse, however, it will spread out to more than one location, making it impossible to identify the individual deposits. Pulmonary mineralization can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Cats with pulmonary mineralization may display no symptoms at all. However, some signs or symptoms that may be observed include: Calcification can be dystrophic (degenerative), which occurs secondary to tissue degeneration or inflammation, or it can be metastatic (transmissible throughout the body), which occurs secondary to metabolic disease, affecting the breakdown of food and its transformation into energy. Calcification may also be considered a normal part of the aging process, or with particular breeds (e.g., premature calcification of the tracheal and bronchial cartilages in chondrodystrophic [dwarf] breeds). Calcification is often associated with a wound, thus most focal calcifications are functionally unimportant. Ossification, also called heterotopic bone formation (the abnormal formation of true bone within extraskeletal soft tissues), can take different forms: calcification of a bony matrix (formative tissue), and pulmonary ossification in the form of small, multiple nodules. Generalized pulmonary mineralizations of unknown cause are reported in cats under these descriptive terms: pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis or pumice stone lung; bronchiolar microlithiasis; idiopathic pulmonary calcification; or idiopathic pulmonary ossification. The underlying cause for pulmonary fibrosis is usually unknown (idiopathic). However, it may be also due to: Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination on the cat, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your veterinarian will conduct a lung biopsy to retrieve samples of tissue from your cat’s lungs in order to determine whether mineralization is occurring. Testing for the presence of bacteria and fungus will also be done. Other diagnostic tools include chest X-rays and a computed tomography (CT) scan, so that your veterinarian can get a better look at the condition of the lungs and lymph nodes. These tools will also help confirm or exclude the presence of a tumor or fungal infection. There are some medications that can relieve breathing problems, or antibiotics and antifungal medications, if your veterinarian determines that there is a concurrent infection. However, there is no treatment indicated if a localized form is found in a cat with no symptoms. If there is an underlying metabolic disease, your doctor will prescribe medications for the treatment of that as well. Otherwise, all that is required is a calm and quite space for your cat to recover. As with any disease of the respiratory system, this is a serious condition. You and your veterinarian will need to carefully monitor your cat’s progress. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_urolithiasis_calcium_oxalate,Calcium Deposits in the Urinary Tract in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Urolithiasis is described as the presence of stones in the urinary tract. When these stones are made of calcium oxalate, they are referred to as calcium deposits. In most cases the stones can be removed safely, giving the cat a positive prognosis. The development of these stones is more common in dogs than in cats, and occurs more frequently in older animals. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library. Although it is rare in cats, the most common symptom of urolithiasis is straining while the animal is urinating. If there is inflammation in the urinary tract, the cat may have an enlarged belly or the area surrounding the urinary region may be noticeably irritated. If the calcium deposits are large, they can sometimes be felt through the skin by a veterinarian. The primary cause for the formation of stones is high levels of calcium in the urine. Some risk factors can include excessive dietary protein or vitamin D, a vitamin B6 deficiency, the use of calcium supplements or steroids, and a diet comprised exclusively of dry food. The most common breeds to develop the medical condition include the Himalayan, the Scottish Fold, the Persian, the Ragdoll, and the Burmese. X-rays and ultrasounds are performed to rule out any other underlying medical conditions which may be causing the cat's pain or trouble urinating. Blood work will be done to examine the cat's nutrient levels and determine if any are outside of the normal range. One of the most common treatment options is the surgical removal of the stones; in some cases shock waves can be used to help break up the stones. Also, depending on the size and severity of the stones, they can occasionally be flushed and massaged out of the cat's system with a catheter and fluids. It is important to reduce the cat's activity levels following surgery. Possible complications from the formation of these stones may arise such as the blockage of the urinary tract and the cat's inability to urinate. It is common for animals to reform these calcium-based stones over time. Treatment on an ongoing basis will include the monitoring of calcium intake and the urinary patterns of the cat to observe if any problems develop. If surgery was used to remove the stones, post-surgical X-rays are recommended to ensure that the stones were completely removed. The best prevention of recurrence is to monitor the cat's calcium levels on an ongoing basis so that adjustments can be made in the diet to maintain normal calcium levels. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_feline_calicivirus,Calicivirus in Cats: Symptoms and Treatment,"miniseries/E+ via Getty Images If your new cat isn’t doing well, they may be affected by calicivirus. Calicivirus in cats is a common virus in newly adopted furry family members that can lead to respiratory signs, limping, and decreased appetite. Medications may be needed to help alleviate feline calicivirus symptoms and help your cat feel better. Let’s look at everything you need to know as a pet parent. Calicivirus in cats is a viral pathogen that causes upper respiratory tract infection in cats. Infection most commonly resembles a cold , but severe infections involving the lungs, joints, and/or other organs can occur. Feline calicivirus is most found in facilities that house multiple cats, such as rescues, shelters, or breeding facilities. However, it can spread readily in households with only a few cats. Kittens and young adult cats are usually at the highest risk for infection, but a cat of any age can be affected. Some pets become infected and do not show any clinical signs of calicivirus in cats. If there are signs, they can range from mild to severe, with severe signs resulting in death. The most common symptoms of calicivirus in cats are: Sneezing Nasal discharge Ulceration of the surface of the nose (skin broken open) Conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) Eye discharge An affected cat may also develop the following: Ulcers on the lip , tongue, or elsewhere in the mouth, often accompanied by drooling Fever Lethargy Dehydration Poor appetite due to severe nasal congestion and/or oral ulcerations The following signs are associated with more severe cases: Pneumonia , with a cough or difficulty breathing Joint inflammation, which causes limping or swelling in the affected joint(s) Signs related to blood vessel wall inflammation (vasculitis), which can lead to multi-organ failure and death, including: Swelling in the face /legs Skin wounds Bloody nose Bloody stool Calicivirus in cats is shed in secretions from the nose, mouth, and eyes. A cat can become infected by contact with secretions containing the virus directly from another cat or indirectly through contact with an object (carrier, food/water bowl, surface) that has been contaminated with infectious secretions. Once inside a cat’s body, calicivirus invades the cells of the nose, throat, mouth, and tonsils. More aggressive strains of calicivirus can invade the lungs, joints, and kidneys. Signs of illness usually develop two to six days post-exposure. There are multiple strains of calicivirus in cats, and sometimes more than one strain may be infecting pets in the same environment. Calicivirus can mutate into a new strain in a cat’s body. There are differences in virulence or disease-causing ability between strains, ranging from mild to severe. Vets diagnose calicivirus in cats using the following methods: Lab work , such as a complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry, will not directly test for calicivirus in cats but may be helpful in determining if there is concurrent illness. Chest radiographs (X-rays) may be recommended if a cat presents with a history of cough, but the findings will not be specific for FCV. Pneumonia can be diagnosed with chest X-rays. Blood tests that measure FCV antibody levels (titers) can be performed, but a positive or elevated titer can happen with both natural exposure and vaccination. It’s impossible to determine the difference using this test alone. A polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) can be performed using swabs from the nose, the inside of the eyelids, and/or the mouth. PCR testing can also be performed on blood, feces , and urine early in the disease process. Keep in mind that a large percentage of healthy cats are long-term carriers of FCV. So just because you find FCV on the test does not mean it is necessarily causing the clinical signs. Supportive care is the gold standard of treatment for calicivirus in cats. Supportive care includes: Place your cat in a warm, steamy bathroom for 10–15 minutes twice daily to help reduce nasal congestion. Nutrition is important because an affected cat with oral ulcerations and nasal congestion may not want to eat. Offer a variety of very strong-smelling foods. Canned food warmed up slightly may be more enticing than cold canned food or dry food. Use warm wet cloths to clean away eye and nose discharge. When cats are not feeling well, they do not want to groom, especially if they also have oral ulcers. Antiviral medication is not commonly used in the treatment of calicivirus in cats, though some medications may be useful, including: Pain medication . This is given to cats with oral/nasal ulcerations to provide comfort. An oral antibiotic can be used to treat secondary infections (nose, lungs, mouth). Your vet may prescribe antibiotics like Clavamox or azithromycin if they suspect a bacterial infection on top of the calicivirus. Topical eye antibiotic medication will be prescribed for cats with eye infections, like tobramycin drops or terramycin ointment . Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be used to reduce inflammation and fever, like Onsior tablets , given once a day for three days. Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids may be indicated if a cat is dehydrated. IV fluids can also help in fever reduction. Most cats will recover from calicivirus in cats in seven to 10 days. However, cats can become carriers and shed virus from oral and nasal secretions long term. Cats that become chronic carriers may develop oral inflammation (gingivitis/stomatitis) and be at increased risk for growths in the nose, mouth, or ear (nasopharyngeal or aural polyps). Vaccination can help prevent the spread of FCV. A vaccinated cat can still become infected with calicivirus but not develop any clinical signs or may have mild signs compared to unvaccinated cats. FCV is highly contagious, so it’s important to isolate the affected cat, either in a bathroom or bedroom, to avoid exposure. Remember that you can spread the virus to unaffected cats after contact with your infected cat if you do not wash your hands or change your clothes after interaction. All materials that have encountered the infected cat need to be thoroughly washed. The virus can live in the environment on surfaces for one to four weeks and is not killed by regular cleaners. Bleach solution (1 part bleach to 32 parts water) can be used to wipe down surfaces and clean materials like bedding, litter boxes, and food and water bowls. Vaccination is an important part of prevention of calicivirus. While some cats may still become infected after being vaccinated, the vaccine can help affected cats' immune systems fight the virus faster and allow them to experience less symptoms. Minimizing overcrowding of cats is also helpful to reduce their exposure. Overcrowded cats are more stressed and it’s easier for viruses to spread from cat-to-cat. When getting a new cat, look at how healthy the overall population of cats appears from the facility you're adopting/purchasing your cat from. Do they have room to breathe? Are there lots of snotty cats with runny eyes? Remember, upper respiratory viruses are very common in cats and easily spread cat-to-cat. Reduce your cat’s exposure by keeping them away from other cats and wash your hands after handling other cats before coming home to your pet. Calicivirus is not contagious to humans. Calicivirus is species-specific and is only contagious to other cats in the household. Most cats will recover from calicivirus uneventfully and live full, happy lives. No, dogs cannot get calicivirus from cats. While most infections resolve after seven to 10 days, some cats can have more persistent infections lasting upwards of 6 weeks. Calicivirus will incubate in a cat’s body for two to six days after exposure before they develop symptoms. Calicivirus can get on the skin and clothing of pet parents or their friends/family and be transferred from sick cats outside the home to cats inside the home.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/can-cats-get-sunburn,Can Cats Get a Sunburn?,"Nicole Zittritsch, LVT, BSc, MPH With the warm weather and long days upon us, we all want to be outside. Nothing beats spending time in the sun surrounded by our loved ones, including our cats. Cats love the heat, and spending time outdoors with them is a great way to enrich their lives. However, during these hot summer months, it’s critical to protect our feline friends from the harmful effects of the sun. In this article, you’ll learn how to keep your cat safe and understand the signs and symptoms of too much sun exposure. Yes. It’s possible for cats to get sunburned if they’re out in the sun for too long. As with people, cat sunburns are also caused by UV radiation. These harmful, invisible rays of energy damage their delicate skin cells, which causes inflammation (swelling) and redness. Cats suffer from sunburn on areas of their bodies that are not covered by fur. Their ears, noses, and bellies are among the areas that are most vulnerable. A cat experiencing sunburn may have: Red, scaly, inflamed, or crusted skin that is hot to the touch. Swollen eyes, stomach, paw pads, nose, and eyes. Pain or discomfort. An urge to lick or scratch the affected part of their body, which may further damage their skin. In severe cases, blisters or sores may develop, which can lead to infection. If your cat is showing any of these signs, contact your veterinarian immediately. Fortunately, sunburns are rare in cats, However, signs of sunburn often look like other underlying conditions, so it’s important to get your cat checked out if you notice any of those listed above. Cats' skin is different from ours, which puts them at an increased risk of sunburn. The sun’s rays can be damaging to felines because they have a thinner epidermis (outer layer of the skin) and less subcutaneous fat (located just under the skin). A cat's skin is sensitive and susceptible to UV damage when exposed to the sun for long periods. They are also more likely to get heatstroke and sunburn due to their inability to sweat. Certain cat breeds are at higher risk of sun damage. Cats with white or light-colored (cream or light gray) fur are more likely to get sunburn , heatstroke, dehydration, or skin cancer . These breeds include Siamese , Himalayan , and Persian. Breeds with the greatest risk of sun damage are those with thin or no fur coats, such as Bambino , Sphynx , Donskoy (Russian Hairless), and Peterbald. However, all cats—regardless of fur length or color—can get sunburn. There are several things you can do to make your cat comfortable if they get sunburn. Apply a cool compress to the affected area for 5-15 minutes. You can also apply cat-friendly aloe vera gel or a honey-based cream. These remedies can help soothe your cat’s skin and reduce inflammation. After a few days, your cat’s skin may begin to peel. Speak with your veterinarian about whether you can give your pet pain medication to relieve discomfort. Don’t use harsh chemicals on your cat’s skin. This includes rubbing alcohol, which causes inflammation, and essential oils, which can be toxic to cats. Though rare, cats suffering from sun damage may need hospitalization for supportive care. This can include fluid therapy, antibiotics, and wound treatment. If you notice visible changes of the skin, your cat is not eating, is lethargic, or is vomiting­–contact your veterinarian immediately. Cats that remain indoors may also be at risk of sun damage. This can occur when UV rays go through windows, which can damage your cat’s skin. You can protect your pet by providing them with shaded areas and closing the curtains of your home during peak sunlight hours. If you are taking your cat outdoors, make sure that they have access to fresh water and a comfortable shaded area where they can rest. Keep your companion indoors during the sunniest parts of the day, typically between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. This will help prevent them from getting overheated. You may also consider buying or building your cat their own shaded patio , where they can enjoy the fresh air while staying safe from the sun and heat. Use sunscreen specifically made for cats to protect their skin from the harmful rays of the sun. Don’t use sunscreen meant for people on your pet. Human sunscreen can be toxic to cats. Before your cat goes outside, apply sunscreen to their ears, nose, and any other exposed areas of their body. Make sure you reapply when necessary. Using these tips to heal and protect your cat from the sun will create a happy, healthy summer for you and your feline friend. Remember to contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat begins showing signs of too much sun exposure.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_cat_flu_H1N1_influenza_infection,Can Cats Get The Flu?,"Jorge Aguado Martin/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images If your cat is coughing and sneezing , you might wonder whether they’ve caught a cold —or something worse. Cats with these symptoms may be experiencing cat flu. It’s common in cats of all ages—especially in unvaccinated cats and kittens—and is caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria Because cat flu can be fatal if left untreated, it is important to recognize the symptoms and contact a veterinarian for treatment as quickly as possible. Yes. Cats can get the flu, and there are many viruses and bacteria that cause this disease. Generally when we think of the flu, we think of the influenza A virus, which includes H1N1 . H1N1—often referred to as swine flu—is a common seasonal virus in people, and was the cause of a widespread pandemic in 2009 . It is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets when people cough, sneeze, or touch contaminated surfaces. It causes typical upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose when a person becomesinfected. While humans can transmit influenza (including H1N1) to cats, this is uncommon. However, cats who come into close contact with a pet parent who has the flu may experience similar respiratory symptoms. Symptoms range from mild to severe and largely depend on the cat’s immune status, age, vaccination status, and how much virus the cat was exposed to. Cats are more commonly affected by feline-specific bacteria and viruses that cause upper respiratory infections, such as calicivirus or herpesvirus —often referred to as cat flu. Cat flu can be fatal if left untreated, especially in immunocompromised cats, unvaccinated cats, or those who are very young or very old. Cat flu is highly contagious to other cats who are in close contact, such as those in shelters or living in the same household. Transmission to people or dogs is thought to be rare and requires more research. Cat flu is spread through contact with contaminated surfaces, close contact between cats, and respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and vocalizing. Rarely, cats can become infected by contact with a sick pet parent. Many viruses and bacteria can cause cat flu. Some of the most common: Feline calicivirus (FCV) Feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) Bordetella bronchiseptica Chlamydia felis (formerly Chlamydophila felis ) Influenza A virus Some cats with the flu might not develop any symptoms. However, the most common signs in symptomatic cats include: Fever Nasal discharge Eye discharge Sneezing Coughing Lethargy Decreased appetite Difficulty breathing If you notice your cat experiencing respiratory symptoms, take them to the veterinarian for a checkup. Your vet will do a thorough physical exam, noting any abnormalities in the eyes, nose, heart, and lungs. They will watch your cat breathe and note any sneezing or coughing during the exam. Sometimes, a diagnosis of an upper respiratory infection can be made based on the symptoms present during the exam. If additional testing is recommended, it may include: PCR : A swab of eye or nose discharge can be taken and submitted to a laboratory to determine what virus or bacteria is causing the symptoms. This is done by means of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique done with a special machine. Virus/bacteria culture : A sample from the eye, nose, or mouth can be processed in a lab to see whether any virus or bacteria grows in nutrient-rich medium or on petri dish. Blood work : A small sample of blood can be taken to check your cat’s overall health and organ function. Chest X-rays : Images of your cat’s lungs and heart can be taken to diagnose complications of cat flu, such as pneumonia. Treatment for cat flu depends on the severity. Some cases might not require any treatment, while other cats need extensive supportive care for recovery. If a cat does require treatment, a veterinarian may prescribe the following: Antibiotics , such as Clavamox —for suspected secondary bacterial infection. Cats with viral infections often have secondary bacterial infections. By treating the bacteria with antibiotics, the cat’s symptoms will improve, and the cat’s immune system can better fight the virus. Antivirals , such as lysine supplements ; your vet may also discuss lysine supplements for FHV-1 support, though evidence is mixed. It is thought lysine supplements may interfere with the replication of feline herpesvirus. When the virus is prevented from replicating, it cannot cause infection or spread and symptoms are reduced. Eye medication , such as Terramycin —for bacterial eye involvement. Cats with viral infections may experience secondary bacterial eye infections. By treating the bacteria, unwanted symptoms such as thick eye discharge and eye redness will dissipate. Nebulizer breathing treatments —to help loosen secretions. Cats with flu have mucus within their airways, which can make breathing difficult and often make other cat flu treatments less effective due to the buildup. By using breathing treatments, a cat’s flu symptoms can greatly improve. Saline nasal drops —to ease congestion. Clearing out nasal congestion for cats with the flu can help them breathe better. Saline nose drops are generally available over-the-counter at local pharmacies and online. Before starting any saline nose drops meant for human use, check with your veterinarian first. In severe cases, hospitalization and supportive care with oxygen therapy, nutritional support, and intravenous fluids might be needed. Mild symptoms of cat flu may resolve on their own within a few days, especially if your cat is still eating and has a normal energy level. In these cases, providing your cat a quiet, private space to rest and recover is helpful. Adding a cool-mist humidifier to this space can help break up mucus as well. It’s also important that your cat has access to fresh food and fresh, clean water to stay hydrated. There are ways to help prevent cat flu, especially if you have multiple cats in your home. Steps include: Keeping infected cats away from other pets in the household. Providing a separate litter box and food and water bowls for the infected cat, to reduce exposure to contaminated surfaces. Thoroughly washing your hands after contact with the affected cat before touching any other surfaces or pets in the home. Talking to your vet about the feline distemper vaccine. Vaccinating your cat for feline distemper (FVRCP) is crucial to protect them from some of the viruses that can cause cat flu. This vaccine protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), calicivirus, and panleukopenia . This vaccine is especially important if you board your cat, due to the close contact with other cats. Yes, but it is not common. Bird flu is caused by an influenza A virus, whereas cat flu is more commonly caused by feline-specific pathogens, such as calicivirus and herpesvirus. Transmission from cats to humans appears to be rare and is not well documented. Cat flu is highly contagious to other cats, but it is rare for cats to transmit it to dogs. Duration varies depending on severity and the cat’s immune system. Most cases resolve within 10–14 days, but severely ill cats can be sick for a month or more. Yes, most cats survive the flu. But if symptoms are severe and left untreated, the disease can be fatal. Prompt veterinary care improves outcomes.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/behavioral/can-cats-have-separation-anxiety,Can Cats Have Separation Anxiety?,"Separation anxiety is a condition commonly known in dogs , but what about cats? Our feline companions have a reputation for being aloof, independent, or even antisocial. Those who share their homes with cats often disagree, but now there is research to back up their claims that cats are not so aloof. A recent study showed that cats living with humans have similar attachment styles to pet parents as dogs and children do. In fact, 64% of the cats evaluated were described as securely attached to their humans. These cats showed less stress when near their caregivers. Here’s how to identify cat separation anxiety and what you can do to provide relief. Separation anxiety is an unwelcome condition that can be a result of excessive attachment. Research supports the fact that cats can develop separation anxiety syndrome, and they show many of the same signs that are seen in dogs. A few possible signs that a cat is suffering from separation anxiety include: Urinating outside the litter box: in one study, three-quarters of the cats that peed outside the litter box did so exclusively on the pet parent’s bed Defecating outside the litter box Excessive vocalization : some cats also carry a favorite toy in their mouths while yowling or crying Destroying things: more common in male cats Excessive grooming : more common in female cats Hyper-attachment to their caregiver: seeking constant contact when they are together Some factors could predispose a cat to developing separation anxiety, while other causes are environmental: Being a female cat. Female cats are diagnosed with separation anxiety more often than male cats. Living strictly indoors. Most separation anxiety cases are seen in cats that live strictly indoors and come from a home with only one adult caregiver. Not having other pets in the home. Being orphaned, weaned early, or bottle-raised. Experiencing a change in routine often prompts separation anxiety or causes it to get worse. (That can include a change in ownership, moving to a new home, or changes in the caregiver’s schedule. A common scenario is a pet parent that has worked from home and then transitions to leaving the house for work each day.) Since the signs of separation anxiety could also indicate other health concerns, diagnosing any emotional disorder always starts with a thorough medical workup to rule out medical issues. This starts with a physical exam that includes lab work such as blood and urine tests. Your veterinarian will then ask detailed questions about your cat’s behavior. Providing a video of your cat’s behavior when they are home alone can be very helpful in determining a diagnosis. Treatment for all anxiety disorders can be divided into three categories: Management of the environment to decrease anxiety from occurring Pharmaceuticals Behavior modification There are quite a few ways you can modify your cat’s environment to help relieve your cat’s separation anxiety. Here are some examples of changes you can make to manage the environment. There are endless options for enrichment activities to keep your cat busy while you are gone. There are TV shows designed specifically for cats and even cameras that allow you to toss treats to your cat and talk to them when you are not home. You can also try puzzle feeders, which are toys that your cat has to play with to release the food inside. Giving one to your cat before you start getting ready to leave can keep them busy so they aren’t worried about what you are doing. Working (hunting) for their food is wonderful enrichment for cats. Try to ignore attention-seeking behaviors whenever possible. Instead, provide attention when your cat is calm and shows signs of independence. For example, you can praise or toss a small treat to your cat when they are resting in another room or when they stop meowing for attention. Remain calm when you leave your house and return home. Wait until your cat is calm and quiet to give them attention after you get home. Giving your cat activities to keep them busy and engaged as you get ready to leave and while you are gone can be very helpful. Some cats also experience a calming effect from pheromone products , such as plug-in diffusers or collars. Consistent routines are very beneficial for pets with anxiety disorders. Keeping to the same schedule as much as you can is good for them. If management changes alone are not enough, your veterinarian may recommend a supplement or medication to reduce your cat’s anxiety. Supplements can yield a 25% improvement in signs, while medications should yield at least a 50% improvement. Some cats benefit most from a short-acting medication that is only given before departures. Others do better on a longer-acting medication that stays in their body all the time. The goal of medications and supplements is to make adjustments to the cat’s brain chemistry. Medications can help cats cope with stressful situations more easily and can help them make progress with behavior modification therapies. The desired effect is the happiest and least-stressed version of your beloved pet. The intention is not for your cat’s personality to change or for them to be a zombie. If there are side effects, a medication can be stopped and you can try something else. Some cats remain on medications for a short period of time, and others can remain on them safely for years. Behavior modification serves the same purpose as cognitive therapy in human psychology. The aim is for the cat to learn coping skills and to change their emotional response to stressful things. One basic technique you can use is a relaxation exercise. This is where you consistently reward your cat when they show signs of being in a relaxed state, such as lying down, sighing, having a loose and still tail, and closing their eyes. The exercise is paired with an item like a mat, so that over time, your cat learns to become relaxed when they see that item. Once relaxation is learned, you can perform parts of your departure routine while your cat is in the relaxed state. Start with simply moving around the room and then progress to approaching the door. As long as your cat remains calm, you can eventually leave the house for longer periods of time. If your cat shows signs of stress when they see certain cues, like putting on shoes or picking up keys, classical counterconditioning can be used. This changes the emotional response from a negative to a positive one. For example, you can pick up your keys, toss a treat to your cat, and then puts your keys down. This only works if your cat’s stress level stays low. If your cat doesn’t look expectantly for a treat after doing this at random times consistently for one week, then a medication may need to be started or adjusted. There are many suggestions out there for how to help separation anxiety in cats, but not all of them are accurate. Some of the most common management suggestions you might find are getting an additional cat, punishment, and confinement. Here’s why you should not use these responses if your cat is suffering from separation anxiety. Unless you get two kittens or littermates together, adding another cat could lead to even more stress and conflict. There is no guarantee that your cat will like the new cat, or that they will become fast friends. You are also adjusting their environment to accommodate the new cat, which can cause additional stress. Punishment makes stress and anxiety worse. Keep in mind that cats do not behave out of spite. Cats with separation anxiety have an illness, no different than diabetes or kidney disease. Pets that panic when left alone are frequently more stressed when they are confined. There is no surefire way to predict which cats will develop separation anxiety. However, there are steps you can take to help decrease the chance your cat will develop this condition. When looking for a cat to join your home, select confident and well-socialized kittens or cats. A pair of kittens, especially littermates, can keep each other company and decrease their dependence on humans. A bonded pair of adult cats is also a good option. Encourage your cat to be independent. They should be used to spending some time away from you as a part of their usual routine. Praise them and give them attention when they choose to spend time across the room or out of sight. From the beginning, keep your departures and returns home very low-key. This helps your cat feel like it’s not a big deal when you leave. Saying a consistent but calm phrase when leaving is helpful for some pets, such as, “Be good; see you soon.” Allowing your cat to explore the outdoors safely provides great enrichment if your cat enjoys it. There are several great options now, including special fencing, “ catios ,” and walking your cat with a harness and leash. It makes sense that the human desire for a devoted companion can also lead to hyper-attachment and separation anxiety. Like any illness, diagnosing and starting treatment early gives your cat the best prognosis. Speak with your veterinarian if you notice any signs that cause you concern. If needed, there are veterinary behaviorists who focus solely on pet psychiatry to help your beloved family member. Your veterinarian can help recommend a veterinary behaviorist in your area. You can also check this directory to find a board-certified veterinary behaviorist near you. Featured Image: iStock.com/undefined undefined Vitale K, Behnke A, Udell M.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/cancer-cats,"Cancer in Cats: Types, Causes, and Treatment","Charlotte Hacker, PhD MixMedia/E+ via Getty Images A cat’s body is made up of millions of tiny cells that provide them with energy, contain DNA, and perform numerous functions, such as fighting infections. Under normal circumstances, cells grow, divide, and die and are then replaced with new cells that repeat this cycle. Sometimes, cells become damaged but continue to grow and divide. This abnormal cell growth can lead to tumor development, which may be cancerous. Approximately 6 million cats in the United States are diagnosed with cancer each year, and 53 to 83% of tumors in cats are cancerous, or malignant. Survival of cancer in cats depends on the cancer type, whether it’s spread, and a cat’s overall health. Cats can develop several types of cancer, including: Lymphoma —Lymphoma is the most common type of cancer in cats. This cancer affects white blood cells called lymphocytes which make up lymphoid tissue that is found throughout the body. The GI tract, kidneys, and lymph nodes are commonly affected in cats. Mastocytoma —Mastocytomas, or mast cell tumors, develop from mast cells, which are made in the bone marrow and circulate throughout the body. Mastocytomas most often develop in the skin or spleen in cats. Leiomyosarcoma —Leiomyosarcoma is a rare but painful type of soft tissue cancer in cats that affects muscles in the stomach and intestines. Fibrosarcoma —Fibrosarcoma affects soft tissues such as muscle and connective tissue. It spreads slowly but can be locally aggressive. Mammary tumors —Mammary tumors affect the tissue surrounding a cat’s teat. They are aggressive tumors that generally spread to nearby lymph nodes and the lungs. Osteosarcoma —Osteosarcoma is bone cancer that affects the skeleton of cats. It is locally aggressive and painful. Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma —Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma develops in a cat’s sweat glands and often occurs in the ear canal. Melanoma —Melanomas are often isolated, raised masses that may bleed. They can affect many parts of the body, including the mouth, skin, and eyes. Myeloproliferative neoplasm —Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a type of blood cancer that originates from the bone marrow. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)—SCC is the most common skin tumor in cats and grows quickly. Hemangiosarcoma —Hemangiosarcoma is a fast-growing tumor that develops from blood vessel cells and may cause internal bleeding. Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)—TCC is a tumor that grows in the bladder of cats. It is locally aggressive. Uterine cancer —Uterine tumors are rare in cats and typically affect middle aged and/or older cats. Treatment involves surgical removal of the uterus (ovariohysterectomy) , commonly referred to as a spay. Cancer in cats can cause several symptoms, which typically depend on the type of cancer. Symptoms may include: Visible lumps and bumps Lethargy Weight gain or loss Vomiting Difficulty eating Diarrhea Trouble breathing Difficulty passing urine or feces Bad breath Sores Bloating Blood in the feces Blood-tinged urine Many factors have been linked to cancer in cats, including: Toxins found in cigarette smoke and asbestos UV light Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Injections and vaccinations Healed fractures , device implantation , preexisting bone disease, and previous irradiation Age at time of spaying Breed, such as Siamese and Persian cats Age (varies according to type of cancer) Your veterinarian will start by reviewing your cat’s entire medical history. It can be helpful to track symptoms you observe prior to the appointment and take pictures of masses that are visible. Next, your vet will perform a thorough exam and will likely test your cat’s blood and urine. They may also perform or recommend imaging tests, such as: X-rays —These may be taken to view your cat’s chest, abdomen, or limbs. Ultrasound —This provides real-time images of your cat’s internal organs. Endoscopy —This involves inserting a small camera into your cat’s mouth or rectum to view the stomach or intestines Computed tomography (CT)—CT uses a computer to make cross-sectional images of parts of a cat’s body with high resolution and contrast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—An MRI scan provides detailed images of your cat’s body without using radiation. Imaging allows your veterinarian to see a tumor but does not diagnose the type of cancer your cat has. Your vet may also collect a sample from the tumor to examine the cells inside it. A fine needle aspirate (FNA) involves inserting a needle into the tumor and using a syringe to suction cells that will be viewed under a microscope. A biopsy involves surgically removing part of the tumor and viewing the cells under a microscope. Biopsies typically provide a more accurate diagnosis and can help your veterinarian predict how a tumor may act. Cats that are not healthy enough for sedation or anesthesia may not be able to undergo more advanced tests, such as CT or MRI imaging, or a biopsy. Whether or not your cat’s cancer is curable depends on many factors, including: Cancer type Pre-existing health conditions Cancer stage Tumor location and size Your cat’s veterinary team will help determine the best treatment plan, which may involve: Surgery —Surgery is commonly performed to remove tumors located near the surface of the skin or that are localized to one area. Chemotherapy — Chemotherapy is given by injection or orally to kill cancer cells. It is often used for cancers that have already spread. Radiation —Radiation therapy uses targeted beams of radiation to kill cancer cells. It may be suggested for tumors that cannot be surgically removed. Immunotherapy —Immunotherapy uses your cat’s immune system to fight cancer, but it is relatively new in cats. Photodynamic therapy —Photodynamic therapy combines light and light-sensitive substances to destroy cancerous tissue. A combination of treatments is often suggested for cats with cancer. For example, surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy , can help ensure all cancerous cells have been removed or destroyed. Some cats may not be healthy enough to withstand treatment, in which case palliative care may be used to keep them comfortable. Your cat’s veterinarian may prescribe pain and anti-inflammatory medications, a special diet, fluid therapy, and blood transfusions. Each cat’s post-treatment recovery and timeline varies. Your veterinarian will provide instructions and expectations for your cat’s individual needs. There are several ways you can support your cat’s recovery: Keep them in a quiet enclosed space with fresh water, food, a bed, and litterbox nearby. Closely monitor your cat. Assist with your cat’s needs, such as grooming or eating. Follow guidelines given by your cat’s veterinarian. Prioritize follow-up appointments. Many cats who are not candidates for treatment can still have a good quality of life. However, if a cat’s quality of life begins to decline, humane euthanasia may be recommended by the veterinarian. Your veterinarian can walk you through this option to ensure you and your cat are comfortable during the process. Your veterinarian will help you decide what your cat may need during recovery. Below is a list of possible items: Oral syringes Waterproof blanket Pill pocket treats Cat bed Soft recovery cone Pet bathing wipes Although many types of cancer can’t be prevented, there are some steps you can take to reduce your cat’s overall risk. Reduce your cat’s likelihood of contact with FeLV by keeping them indoors and keeping their vaccinations up to date . Reduce your cat’s exposure to indoor toxins , such as asbestos and tobacco smoke. Minimize your cat’s exposure to UV light. Prioritize annual vet appointments for young adults and biannual appointments for cats older than 8 years. How long a cat can live with cancer is highly variable and dependent on several factors. Some cats may live just a few days while others may live several years. Corp-Minamiji C.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_hemangiopericytoma,Cancer of the Blood Vessel Cells in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Where hemangio refers to the blood vessels, and a pericyte is a type of connective tissue cell, a hemangiopericytoma is metastatic vascular tumor arising from the pericyte cells. A pericyte might best be described as a non-specialized cell. It is one of the original embryonic cells, but instead of taking on a specific function, it remains in its first stage, waiting until it is needed. The function of the pericyte is to differentiate into whatever type of cell the body requires to function, regenerating new tissue as needed. In this case, the pericyte is damaged by improper cell division, and instead of forming tissue that is useful to the body, it forms a tumor. This affects the cells surrounding very small blood vessels, called capillaries, in the subcutaneous tissue. Although a hemangiopericytoma does not usually spread throughout the body, it does grow continuously at the the site of origin. Over the course of several months to possibly years, this deeply rooted tumor grows until it has taken up the space in which it resides, affected the nearby organs and eventually impairing their function. This can be especially fatal when it occurs in the chest, close to the heart and lungs. Fortunately, this tumor has a high rate of successful treatment, but it must be treated before it has grown to unmanageable proportions. This is a relatively rare tumor in cats. The exact cause is still unknown, may be genetically predisposed. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. After the initial background information has been noted, your veterinarian will perform complete physical examination, which will include routine laboratory tests: a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are usually within normal ranges. A more definitive diagnosis will be based on the results of a biopsy analysis. Your veterinarian will take tissue a sample from the growing mass and examine it microscopically to confirm the diagnosis and determine the grade of the tumor. Your veterinarian may also take X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to evaluate the extent of the local metastasis and how deeply rooted the tumor is. These studies will be key in planning the surgery and ongoing therapy for your cat. Early and aggressive surgical excision of the affected tissue, along with some of the surrounding normal tissue remains the treatment of choice. A skilled veterinary surgeon will be called on to excise the affected area in order to enhance the chances of a complete removal of tumor. The removed tissue will be submitted to a veterinary pathologist for evaluation. Radiation therapy is generally highly successful with this type of tumor. You and your veterinarian will work together to decide if surgery along with radiation therapy is the best course of treatment for your cat. In many cases, recurrence is expected, as this type of cellular tumor has a high incidence of recrudescence. Your veterinarian will monitor the area in follow up visits, and if the hemangiopericytoma should recur, you doctor will explain the options to you so that you can make the treatment decision that is most appropriate for your cat. In some patients amputation of the affected limb is an option, as this will remove the entire affected area. Because this type of tumor usually remains local and does not spread out in the body, this can be a very effective method for resolving the issue. Another method is to remove the growth again. This method, along with radiotherapy, may be effective, especially for those patients in which complete removal of mass is not possible. The drawback is that if the tumor should return yet again, it will be more deeply rooted in the tissue, as each recurrence becomes more invasive than the last. The last method is to take no action at all. This may be the appropriate response, especially if your cat is older. The tumor grows at a slow rate and does not affect the animal's health until it has grown to a size where it is affecting the organs and/or limbs. Conversely, this may not be the appropriate response if your cat is young. The overall survival time largely depends upon the nature of the tumor and the aggressiveness with which surgery and treatment are conducted. A cure is possible in animals that have undergone early and aggressive surgical resection of the tumor. Because recurrence of hemangiopericytoma is common, you will need to take your cat for follow up checkups or radiotherapy treatments. Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for progress evaluation visits. Your veterinarian will prescribe post-surgery pain killers for your cat to help make it more comfortable. Use pain medications with caution; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is due to overdose of medication. Cage rest is recommended after surgery. A quiet area set aside, away from household traffic, active children and other pets will help your cat to recover. Also, setting the litter box and food dishes close by to where your cat is convalescing will allow your cat to remain capable. Keep in mind that you should not leave the cat alone for extended periods of time. Affection is a great help for recovery, and you will need to make sure that the cat is not laying in the same position for long. In case of limb amputation, most cats recover well, learning to compensate for the lost limb. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_lymphomatoid_granulomatosis,Cancerous Lymphoid Cells in the Lungs of Cats,"PetMD Editorial When cancerous lymphoid cells (lymphocytes and plasma cells) infiltrate lung tissue, it is known as Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis, a rare disease that affects cats. Metastasis may occue in other body sites and organs like the liver, heart, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is not breed- or gender-specific, but is more common in large and purebred cats. Respiratory symptoms are often seen which aggravate over time. The following are a few of the more common symptoms related to this disease: The underlying cause for lymphomatoid granulomatosis is currently unknown. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are usually non-specific and inconsistent with the disease. Blood testing, meanwhile, may reveal an abnormally high number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils (all types of white blood cells) in the blood. And X-rays will reveal details related to lung tissue and abnormalities. The attending veterinarian may also take a small lung tissue sample (biopsy) to be sent to veterinary pathologist for a definitive diagnosis. Unfortunately, there is no cure available. However, chemotherapy is often combined with surgical excision of the affected tissue. Regular blood testing, and cardiac and other body system evaluation are necessary during treatment. Because there is no cure available, you should talk to a veterinary oncologist for their best recommendations. Chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic to different body systems, and various complications are seen during and after treatment. Call your veterinarian immediately if you observe any untoward symptoms in your cat such as difficulty breathing, depression, or lack of appetite. In case of serious complications, your veterinarian may reduce dosages or stop the treatment altogether. In addition, chemotherapy medication is potentially hazardous to human health and should always be administered with the consent of a veterinary oncologist and kept in a secure place.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/capillaria-cats,Capillaria in Cats,"GabrielPevide/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Capillaria are small parasitic worms that can affect many different types of animals. They aren’t very common in cats, but when they do get Capillaria , it’s usually the kinds that invade the bladder— Capillaria plica and Capillaria feliscati , which are also called Pearsonema plica and Pearsonema feliscati . These Capillaria species collectively are called bladder worms because the adults attach themselves to the wall of the bladder (and occasionally the kidneys or other parts of the urinary tract), where they can cause inflammation and other health problems. Cats with capillariasis (the disease caused by Capillaria worms) rarely get very sick. Still, the condition can become a medical emergency in the unlikely event that a cat develops a urinary blockage . Many cats with Capillaria have no clinical signs at all. However, if a cat has a lot of bladder worms, you may notice symptoms such as: Straining to urinate Producing small amounts of urine frequently Blood in the urine Urinary accidents Other health problems ( feline idiopathic cystitis , for example) cause similar symptoms and are much more common than Capillaria in cats. The life cycle of Capillaria in cats isn’t fully understood, but it’s thought to go something like this: A cat, dog, fox, raccoon, coyote, or other animal that has bladder worms releases capillaria eggs into the environment when they urinate. The eggs hatch, releasing larvae that are eaten by earthworms. The larvae mature within earthworms until they reach the stage that can infect a new host. A cat eats the earthworm (or parts of an earthworm) in one of three ways: Directly By eating another animal that has earthworms in their digestive tract By licking debris that contains bits of earthworm off their coat and skin The larvae make their way through the wall of the cat’s intestines to the bladder, where they mature into adults that breed and release eggs in the cat’s urine. Whenever a cat has urinary problems, a veterinarian will collect a sample of urine and run a urinalysis. Part of a urinalysis involves using a centrifuge to separate out bigger objects (like cells or eggs) and then looking at them under the microscope. If a veterinarian sees Capillaria eggs during the urinalysis, they can easily diagnose the cat with bladder worms. A urinalysis can also be a part of wellness screening in cats, which is how a cat without symptoms may end up being diagnosed with capillariasis. Bloodwork and other diagnostic tests may also be necessary to evaluate the cat’s overall health and plan appropriate treatment. Several anthelmintics (drugs that kill worms) are effective against Capillaria . The one most commonly prescribed is fenbendazole . Fenbendazole is very safe but isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cats. However, veterinarians can prescribe it off-label to treat bladder worms. Other medications such as ivermectin (usually given by injection) can also be effective. Severe cases of Capillaria may cause a lot of inflammation in a cat’s bladder. A few days of treatment with an anti-inflammatory medication ( prednisolone , for example) can keep cats comfortable as their bladder heals. Fluid therapy and other forms of supportive care may also be needed. Cats who have Capillaria and receive appropriate treatment usually recover quickly. Give your cat their medications as instructed by your veterinarian and make sure that your cat is eating, drinking, and urinating normally. Call your veterinarian if your cat’s symptoms get worse at any point or don’t start improving after a few days. After the medications have had a chance to get rid of the Capillaria , your veterinarian may recommend a follow-up urinalysis to ensure that no more eggs are present in your cat’s urine. This is especially important if your cat doesn’t have any symptoms associated with their bladder worms, because it's hard to determine if treatment has been effective in these situations. Preventing Capillaria in cats isn’t difficult. Eating earthworms or small pieces of earthworms appears to be the only way that cats can contract capillariasis. Therefore, keeping cats indoors and away from earthworms is the best form of prevention. If your cat must go outdoors, your veterinarian may recommend that you give a deworming medication on a regular schedule to protect your pet from Capillaria and other internal parasites. Bladder worms in cats are not directly contagious. It is thought that their immature forms (larvae) must spend time inside earthworms before they can infect other animals. People can get capillariasis , but it is caused by a different species of Capillaria worm and has nothing to do with cats.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_carbon_monoxide_toxicosis,Carbon Monoxide Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, nonirritating gas produced by the inefficient combustion of carbon fuels. It is potentially toxic for cats as well as humans. Unventilated kerosene or propane heaters, gasoline engines, automobile exhaust, or fumes from carbon-based fuel heating systems are all potential sources for carbon monoxide toxicity. When inhaled, this gas is readily absorbed into the blood, combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin, reducing oxygen delivery to the body, and thereby leading to decreased utilization of oxygen in the brain and heart. Most cases of carbon monoxide toxicity in pets occur as a result of human error, such as when a cat has been left in an enclosed area where carbon monoxide is being released. For example, a cat left in an enclosed garage with a running automobile can be exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide in about ten minutes. Cats are also exposed to toxic levels of carbon monoxide when they are trapped in a building that is on fire. Prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide will lead to hypoxemia and eventually death. Depending upon the concentration and duration of exposure of carbon monoxide, the symptoms may be acute or chronic in nature. Symptoms with chronic exposure to carbon monoxide include: Exposure to any source of carbon monoxide, like: The foremost step in carbon monoxide toxicity is to get your cat away from the source of the carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide toxicity is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate veterinary intervention. Your veterinarian will start immediate oxygen therapy to remove the carbon monoxide from the blood and bring your cat's oxygen levels back to normal. While your cat is receiving oxygen your veterinarian will collect samples of blood for diagnostic testing. A complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis and other applicable body fluid tests will be performed. Your veterinarian will also collect samples for determination of carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood. Establishing the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood is the most useful test for basing the initial treatment plan. Carboxyhemoglobin levels rise in acute cases and drop within a few hours once exposure to the source of the carbon monoxide has been removed. Levels of acids in the blood will also be determined during blood testing, as acid concentrations tend to rise in response to this condition and their values will determine the appropriate diagnosis and medical response. Other diagnostic tools your veterinarian may use include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to determine whether the heart has also been affected. If you suspect that your cat has been subjected to excessive amounts of carbon monoxide, immediately call for veterinary help. In the meantime, remove your cat from the source of the toxic gas to a location where it can breathe fresh air. Your veterinarian will start emergency treatment to restore adequate levels of oxygen to the vital organs. Supplementation of 100 percent pure oxygen is the best method for initiating a quick recovery. Fluids will also be given to improve blood perfusion to vital organs like the brain, as well as to normalize the increased concentrations of acids in blood. While your cat is recovering from the carbon monoxide poisoning, limit its activity for at least six weeks. Encourage the cat to relax as much as possible and make a place where it can go to be alone, while still being available, as some cats need extra attention during a time of stress such as this. Watch your cat for any recurrence of symptoms and call for help if you suspect any untoward symptom in your cat. Nervous symptoms may be seen in some animal patients weeks after the initial recovery. If you do become aware of any nervous system abnormalities, call your veterinarian for advisement. Carbon monoxide is as lethal to you as to your cats, therefore, use carbon monoxide detectors at home to prevent possible or re-occurring episodes. The human element is the most important line of prevention. Protect your cats from any sources of carbon monoxide. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_carcinoid_syndrome_tumor,Carcinoid Cancer in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow growing tumors that are formed by the endocrine cells in the mucosal lining of organs, such as the stomach and intestine. These tumors are small neuroendocrine tumors, typically of the gastrointestinal tract, that secrete serotonin, a naturally occurring neurochemical that is usually associated with sleep and memory functions. Carcinoid tumors secrete the amines serotonin and histamine into the bloodstream, as well as a number of peptides - chemical compounds such as bradykinins and tachykinins, which are responsible for tissue contraction. Carcinoid tumors are rare in animals, but when they do occur it is generally after a cat has reached seven years of age. Primary carcinoid tumors are usually found in the stomach, small intestine, liver, and heart. The general clinical symptoms of carcinoid tumors include anorexia, vomiting, dyschezia, weight loss due to liver failure, and heart disease. As with many types of cancers, the actual causes and risk factors for carcinoid tumors are unknown. Clinical signs in cats can vary greatly, depending on the location of the tumor and how far the metastasis has advanced. The size of the tumor and how it may be impeding the functionality of the organ it resides in will also have a lot of influence on how ill your pet feels, and whether or not it will be fatal. There are a variety of ways to diagnose carcinoid tumors. An intestinal tumor may cause some of the same symptoms as primary gastrointestinal diseases, such as neoplasias, dietary indiscretions, parasites, and inflammation related to any other condition. Therefore, a differential diagnosis will be necessary — meaning that your doctor will base the findings on a process of elimination, using both the symptoms and the results of tests. Biochemical tests and urine analysis may yield normal results, with the exception of a mild non-regenerative anemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and elevated liver enzymes. An ultrasound image may lead to the identification of primary tumors and metastasis in the abdomen and thorax. However, a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a biopsy of the affected tissues. An electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical stains can help to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the substances that are typically secreted by carcinoid tumors. Sometimes, complete surgical removal of the tumor can cure the condition. Reducing the size of the tumor through surgery may also help to eliminate any gastrointestinal symptoms that are being caused by the obstruction of a large tumor. There are no other standard therapies for treating carcinoid tumors, but your veterinarian may have some treatment options available that will help to keep metastasis to a minimum, or to help make your pet comfortable. If a tumor can not be completely removed, routine blood tests will need to be conducted to determine whether destructive hepatic metastasis is occurring. A yearly ultrasound is also recommended for monitoring progress, so that if any metastasis has occurred in the liver, or in other organs, it can be treated promptly, before organ functionality is reduced.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_cardiac_arrest,Cardiac Arrest in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Also known as circulatory arrest or cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiac arrest is the cessation of normal blood circulation ceases due to the heart's inability to contract (heart failure). Like many other body systems, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems work in a coordinated fashion. Therefore, if a cat fails to breathe for more than six minutes, it can lead to heart failure and cardiac arrest -- both of which can be fatal. Cardiac arrest can occur in cats of any age, sex, or breed. Blood circulation may remain intact if the animal resumes breathing within four minutes of the initial problem. However, if it lasts longer than six minutes it can lead to cardiac arrest. Common symptoms associated with this emergency include: Cardiac arrest is an emergency that will require immediate veterinary assistance to assess the animal's condition and the form of treatment. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated the complications. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, focusing on the cat's airways, breathing ability, and circulation. Your veterinarian will also constantly monitor your cat's blood pressure and pulse rate. Routine diagnostic exams used to determine the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest include chest X-rays, complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Blood samples are collected to determine the level of gases, including oxygen, in the blood. Cats suspected of having an underlying heart disease may undergo echocardiography to evaluate the extent of the problem. This is a life-threatening emergency that will require immediate hospitalization and intensive nursing support and treatment. The primary goal is to restart the cat's heart rhythm and respiration rate, which may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ). Once the trachea is cleared and CPR is performed, a tube may be passed into the trachea to facilitate breathing. Oxygen may also be supplied to normalize the blood oxygen levels. Cats with heart failure may require external cardiac massage to stimulate heart to beat normally. Those unresponsive to cardiac massage may receive rapid chest compressions. Typically medications are administered to assist in normalizing cardiac functions. Otherwise, the chest is incised to provide the open chest resuscitation to the animal or medications are administered directly into the heart -- both of which are considered a last resort. The overall prognosis will depend on the underlying cause of the cardiac arrest and the course of treatment. Unfortunately, less than 10 percent of cats recover, even after successful emergency treatment. If your cat's condition does stabilize, it will need to stay in the hospital for a few days. There, the veterinarian may monitor cardiac functions and blood pressure and treat any further complications. Was this article helpful?

While the heartbeat can speed up or slow down depending on the needs of the body, it does so with a consistent rhythm controlled by electric signals that move in a very specific path through the heart muscles. When this path is interrupted or when signals are generated abnormally, it results in a cardiac arrhythmia. Arrhythmias are relatively uncommon in cats. A recent study found arrhythmias in only 2.6% of cats. Most cardiac arrhythmias in cats indicate structural issues in the heart or systemic disease, though some irregular heartbeats can be found in normal heart function. When arrhythmias are due to disease, the heart’s chambers can contract out of sync, and blood will not flow through the lungs and to the body properly. This leads to decreased oxygen in the tissues and can cause fluid buildup in the lungs, chest, and abdomen. Cats are very good at hiding signs of disease, so even when arrhythmias are due to illness, symptoms are often hard to spot until the situation is severe. Arrhythmias can be life-threatening, depending on the type and cause. If you notice symptoms of a cardiac arrhythmia in your cat, take them to the veterinarian immediately. There are several alterations to the heart’s pattern that can cause cardiac arrhythmias in cats, including: Sinus arrhythmia —A rate change with normal signal transmission that is not a concern for a cat’s health. No symptoms are typically shown, and heart function is normal. The heart rate changes to match the cat’s breathing pattern. AV block —Occurs when the signal between the top of the heart and bottom of the heart gets interrupted. It usually sounds like a very slow heart rate (bradycardia). If the signal is only delayed (first-degree block), treatment is not needed. Severe heart block stops the signal entirely and can be life-threatening. Premature beats —In these arrhythmias, the signal to contract starts in an abnormal place. These abnormal rhythms are described based on where the signal starts—either supraventricular premature contractions (SVPC) from the top of the heart or ventricular premature contractions (VPC) from the bottom of the heart. Isolated SVPCs and VPCs are usually not of concern and can occur in normal patients, but if these signals occur quickly, they can lead to fast heart rates called supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia. This doesn’t allow normal function of the heart. Cats with these arrhythmias may show panting and collapse. If left untreated, these arrhythmias can be fatal. Symptoms of arrhythmias can be difficult for pet parents to see, and many cats will have no obvious clinical signs. Unfortunately, in some cases of arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, no symptoms are seen until sudden death occurs. Subtle changes that can be seen are a decreased appetite and your cat sleeping more . These signs may come and go if the arrhythmia is not constant. You may also want to look out for symptoms of disease that can lead to arrhythmias. Weight loss , increased thirst , or vomiting should prompt an evaluation of your kitty for hyperthyroidism , kidney disease , and intestinal disease. Symptoms of severe cardiac arrhythmias in cats include: Syncope (fainting) Increased respiratory rate Open-mouth breathing Abdominal distension If you notice any of these symptoms, take your cat to an emergency veterinary hospital immediately. Most arrhythmias in cats are due to underlying structural heart disease. Cats may be born with abnormal heart development (congenital heart disease). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are primarily genetic, progressive diseases that lead to extremely thick (in HCM) or thin (in DCM) heart muscles. Infection and trauma can also make enough change to the heart muscle to cause an arrhythmia. High blood pressure , low red blood cell count (anemia), alterations in the nervous system, and certain electrolyte changes in the bloodstream can lead to arrhythmias even when the heart structure stays normal. Hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, cancer , and certain toxins have all been linked to arrhythmias. If these conditions can be treated, the arrhythmias usually resolve. Arrhythmias can occur in any cat of any age of any breed, but breeds like Ragdolls , Himalayans , and Siamese are more predisposed to structural heart disease and arrhythmias. A recent study found that abnormal heart rhythms are also more common in male cats and older cats. Typically, veterinarians diagnose cardiac arrhythmia in cats with a full physical exam. If your vet hears a heart murmur (abnormal heart sounds), further testing may be needed even if they don’t hear an abnormal rhythm. To determine which arrhythmia your cat has, an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed. This maps out the electric signal that the heart muscle is sending. These electric signals are different for each type of arrhythmia. In cases where an arrhythmia is intermittent, your vet may recommend a Holter monitor, a small vest that runs an ECG for 24 hours while your cat behaves normally at home. Usually this is enough to catch even the most minor arrhythmia. Your vet will recommend blood work to evaluate kidney function, electrolyte levels, and thyroid levels, as these systemic issues may be causing the abnormal rhythm and can be treated directly. To look for underlying heart disease, your vet may recommend a specific blood test called a proBNP, which detects elevated levels of the proBNP hormone when the heart muscle is stretched abnormally. Chest X-rays may or may not show heart enlargement in cats with heart disease, but they should be performed to look for fluid buildup or enlarged vessels that may indicate heart failure. An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) with a veterinary cardiologist will give the best information about the structure and internal function of your cat’s heart. This is the best way to look for heart muscle abnormalities like HCM and DCM and determine how severe the heart disease is. Treatment of arrhythmias is highly dependent on the underlying cause. While medications to alter heart rhythm and rate exist, they are rarely used in cats because underlying issues are so common. Arrhythmias caused by thyroid disease, kidney disease, or low red blood cell counts will need to have those conditions treated directly. Arrhythmias due to structural heart disease like HCM or DCM may be managed with medications to improve heart function and slow heart rate. Unfortunately, cardiomyopathies are diseases that are managed, not cured, and heart function may worsen over time despite treatment. Pacemakers may be placed for rare cases where the arrhythmia is only due to electrical misfiring, such as AV block. These implants directly control the electrical signal to a cat’s heart muscle. Pacemakers are not used in cats who already have structural changes and remodeling of the heart muscle. Recovery of cardiac arrhythmia in cats also depends on the underlying cause. Mild heart disease or systemic diseases like hyperthyroidism can usually be managed on an outpatient basis with oral medications. Severe kidney failure and heart failure may require hospitalization and intensive care. Whether inpatient or outpatient, most arrhythmias require frequent monitoring with your veterinarian to avoid progression. The goal with arrythmia management is for cats to live a normal life at home. Due to the increased risk of fainting, cats with arrhythmias should remain indoor-only and may benefit from having food and litter on the same level of your home so they don’t have to navigate stairs. Unfortunately, there’s not much the pet parent can do to prevent cardiac arrhythmias in cats. But annual exams and routine blood work can help find arrhythmias and their causes before the disease becomes severe. One form of dilated cardiomyopathy has been linked to low taurine levels in a cat’s diet . The majority of well-balanced commercial cat foods now have taurine added to avoid this issue. If you notice an elevated heart rate in your cat, it’s important to look for other symptoms. If your cat is breathing normally, eating well, and playful, it’s reasonable to call your vet for a non-emergency visit to discuss the high heart rate. If your cat is visibly in pain, breathing very fast or panting, has recently collapsed, or is not eating their meals, an emergency vet visit is needed. There are no treatments to be performed at home in these situations.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_rhabdomyoma,Cardiac Muscle Tumor in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A rhabdomyoma is an extremely rare, benign, non-spreading, cardiac muscle tumor that occurs only half as often as its malignant version: rhabdomyosarcomas, an invasive, metastasizing (spreading) tumor. Rhabdomyomas are usually found in the heart, and are suspected of being congenital in origin (present at birth). This type of tumor does not become malignant, nor does it metastasize through the body. They are very rarely found outside of the heart, but do occur in other places of the body on occasion. They have been reported in the ears of cats. Rhabdomyomas can affect both cats and dogs. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library. Idiopathic (unknown). You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. From there, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your pet, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Your veterinarian will use the results of the bloodwork to confirm, or rule out, other diseases. Bloodwork will typically appear normal in patients with a rhabdomyoma, since the tumor is relatively harmless. X-ray imaging, and an echocardiogram of the heart may help your veterinarian to diagnose a rhabdomyoma. Additional examination using an electrocardiogram will note heart arrhythmias (rhythm abnormalities). For a definitive diagnosis, an examination of tissue from the tumor (biopsy) can be performed. Treatment is not usually necessary for a rhabdomyoma in the heart, since surgery of the heart would carry more risk than any benefit it might provide. But for rhabdomyomas located in an area other than the heart, surgery to remove them should be fairly uncomplicated since they are not very invasive. Your veterinarian will schedule monthly follow-ups for the first three months after your cat has been discharged in order to do progress checks. Follow-up visits may then be scheduled at three to six month intervals for another year. The concern is that rhabdomyomas in the heart may lead to right-sided congestive heart failure due to obstruction of blood flow. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/cat-abscesses-what-are-they-and-how-do-you-treat-them,"Cat Abscesses: What Are They, and How Do You Treat Them?","FreshSplash/E+ via Getty Images A cat abscess is a wound that becomes infected, leading to pus accumulation beneath the skin. Abscesses are often swollen, painful to the touch , and make affected kitties feel really uncomfortable. Cat abscesses are very common as the result of a cat fight . Cat’s mouths have lots of bacteria that are pushed deep beneath the skin when their teeth puncture a surface. The bacteria multiply and the body sends white blood cells to try and fight off the infection. As these white blood cells accumulate, a pocket of pus forms. This pocket is called an abscess. Cats often stop eating and are lethargic when they have an abscess, so prompt treatment is recommended. Leaving the abscess untreated may lead to it rupturing open, which can result in an even larger wound. Symptoms of cat abscesses include: Swelling Pain Decreased appetite Lethargy Red discoloration of the skin White, green, yellow, pink, or brown smelly discharge leaking from a wound Hair loss over the affected area Limping (if a limb is affected) Cat abscesses are caused by a bacterial infection. Most commonly the bacteria come from a bite wound. Sometimes deep scratches, penetrating sticks, weed seeds, or other puncture wounds can cause an abscess to form as well. Cats can also get abscesses on their face from an infected tooth root , rather than a wound. On rare occasions, cats get internal abscesses from bacteria invading the lungs, liver, pancreas, or brain. Abscesses are usually diagnosed by a physical exam . Your vet will likely palpate (feel) all over your cat’s body. They will take your cat’s temperature and get a thorough history about their exposure to other cats and the outdoors. Your vet may recommend aspirating fluid from any swollen regions to determine the cause of the swelling. They may follow up with looking at the cells from the swollen tissue under the microscope to confirm it’s bacterial or send it off for a culture and sensitivity test. This test involves placing the discharge on a petri dish to determine which type of bacteria is causing the abscess. They can then use small antibiotic impregnated discs to find out which antibiotic will work the best to kill that strain of bacteria. More serious internal abscesses may require blood work or imaging to determine a diagnosis. Abscesses are usually treated by draining and cleaning the wound and starting your cat on a course of antibiotics. Fortunately, most cats respond well to treatment. Sometimes abscess treatment can be done on an outpatient basis, but other times your veterinarian may need to surgically open the abscess with your cat under anesthesia , which may require an overnight stay. It’s important to follow all medication instructions if your cat goes home with oral antibiotics. Antibiotic selection varies, depending upon the suspected bacterial agent at play, but Clavamox ® is very common. Sometimes Convenia ®, a long-acting injectable antibiotic, may be given instead to avoid oral medication in cats that will not take pills or liquids. Pain medication such as Onsior ™ may also be prescribed for your cat. Cats with a tooth root abscess need the affected tooth removed . These kitties will also get antibiotics after surgery and may need to stay in the hospital overnight while recovering. Once drainage has been established and the abscess is open and clean, it will need to heal. It’s important that your cat remain indoors during this period to keep the wound clean and avoid access to flies, so that maggots do not become an issue. A Comfy Cone ™ may be necessary if your cat is trying to lick their wound. Your vet may or may not recommend topical products to help with wound healing, like chlorhexidine solution or medical manuka honey . Talk to your vet before applying any products. Probiotics may be helpful to restore normal gut flora following the course of antibiotics. Depending on the size of your cat’s wound, most abscesses will heal in a matter of one to two weeks. Cats allowed outside are much more likely to get abscesses than indoor cats. Avoiding exposure to other cats who may have territory squabbles with your cat, as well as the risk of injury by a penetrating foreign body (like a stick or nail), is also reduced by keeping your cat indoors. Cats that have not been neutered are more likely to get into tussles with other cats. Making sure your pet is spayed or neutered may reduce their risk of fighting and subsequent abscesses. Maintaining oral health with regular dental procedures may also reduce your cat’s risk of future abscesses in the mouth. Treatment for cat abscesses costs vary based on where you live, the location of the abscess, how extensive it is, and whether sedation, anesthesia, or prolonged wound care is required. Generally, it can cost anywhere from $200 to $2,000 to treat an abscess. Occasionally, a small abscess that ruptures on its own may heal without medical intervention. This is a big gamble to take, however, because untreated infections can spread throughout the body and make your cat sick, especially if they’re immunocompromised (have a pre-existing medical condition). Bite wounds are the main cause of abscesses in cats, and other diseases such as feline leukemia , feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) , and even rabies can be spread through a bite.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/cat-acne,Cat Acne,"Viktor_Gladkov/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images If you’ve ever noticed red bumps, black dots, or dirt on your cat’s chin, your cat may struggle with cat acne, or cat chin acne. At its basic definition, cat chin acne is a disease in which the hair follicles—typically the ones on a cat’s chin—produce too much keratin and become plugged up. This results in red bumps, blackheads, and infected pimple-like lesions. Cats can have a single, isolated bout of cat acne, or it may be chronic. Chronic or severely affected cats may have so many plugged follicles that they fuse together, and form swollen, painful crusts. As the lesions get bigger, the follicles are more prone to rupture, which is a sore and often messy experience. Cat acne can also lead to chronic hair loss in the affected area . Felines of all ages can develop acne, since it’s not believed to be related to sex hormones. Additionally, cat acne affects males and females of all breeds, as well as both and neutered and unneutered cats. Cats that eat and/or drink out of plastic food bowls may also be at risk of cat acne, as it may stem as a form of plastic allergy . Health Tools Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps. Symptoms of cat acne include: Redness or swelling Bumps and pustules Scabs and crusts Pain around the chin Cat acne is a poorly understood disorder that’s related to the overproduction of keratin, a key structure that makes up the outer layer of skin. For several reasons, this excess keratin becomes trapped, causing the formation of blackheads, or comedones. When these blackheads become infected with bacteria, they form pustules that look like pimples. Cat chin acne is believed to be associated with: Poor grooming Excessive sebum (oil) and keratin production The skin’s immune-barrier function Regardless of the underlying issue, hair follicles become blocked, resulting in infection . Veterinarians diagnose cat acne based on physical exam findings, your cat’s medical history, and the elimination of other possible skin conditions . A skin scraping and looking at a small sample of skin under the microscope may be needed to help rule out other causes, such as mange , various skin tumors , and a condition called eosinophilic granuloma complex . ADVERTISEMENT Never pick at your cat’s acne. Picking will only worsen the condition and potentially cause more pain and even infection. Cat acne treatment begins with taking any plastic food or water bowls and changing them out immediately for stainless steel. This, along with supportive care, may be all that is needed to resolve cat acne. Treatment may also involve the use of oral or injectable antibiotics and topical shampoo or wipes . If your cat’s skin begins to clear, the shampoos and topical treatments can gradually be stopped. If the outbreaks of cat acne reoccur, your veterinarian will help develop an appropriate maintenance routine to keep your cat’s chin as clear as possible. Maintenance cleansing with gentle scrubbing has been successful for many cats because it extends the amount of time between episodes and treatment. For most patients, improved hygiene—including washing your cat’s face and wiping your cat’s chin—is core to the treatment plan for cat acne. Your vet may recommend cleaning their face with benzoyl peroxide facial wipes, but you need to get wipes specifically made for cats, as human wipes are too strong. Clipping the nearby fur can also cut down the number of bacteria. Clean your cat’s water and food dishes more often and a switch to stainless steel , glass, or ceramic dishes . Cat acne is typically a superficial problem and not usually one that will have serious impacts on your cat’s overall health. Most cases of cat acne are relatively harmless and respond well with improved hygiene. Cat chin acne does become painful if it reaches the point where lesions swell and/or scab. If this occurs, more aggressive treatment is required to manage your cat’s acne. Cat acne can often be prevented by using non-plastic food and water bowls for your feline friend. Keep their chin clean, especially if you notice any food residue or that your cat isn’t washing themselves as often. If you see any signs of pimples or blackheads, addressing them early will make sure the condition is unlikely to progress. Cat acne can be a one and done experience for some cats, or a long-standing and chronic problem lasting months or years for others. Cats can get blackheads on some parts of their bodies. This is true particularly for their chins, which is highly sensitive to blackheads and pimples. WRITTEN BY Veterinarian Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/systemic/allergies-cats,Cat Allergies: Types and Symptoms,"Valery Bocman/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images An allergy is an immune response sensitivity to certain substances that cause allergic reactions. These are classified as antigens or allergens. Typically, allergens are inherently harmless (like pollen, foods, or dust), but in certain individuals, the body overreacts and stimulates an inflammatory response that causes allergy symptoms. Yes! Cats can have allergies. In fact, they are extremely common in cats. Cats with multiple types of allergies are more difficult to diagnose, treat, and manage. Allergies are typically a life-long condition that can impact a cat and pet parent’s quality of life. While some breeds may be more prone to allergies, they can occur in all cats. Purebred cats are more likely to have airborne allergies than domestic short hairs. Siamese cats tend to be more likely to have food allergies Early intervention is critical to long-term success. As soon as you notice your cat may be suffering from allergies, call your veterinarian for an exam . Veterinarians recognize these six major types of allergies in cats. These different types of cat allergies include: Food allergies Atopic dermatitis , or environmental allergies Flea allergy dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis—when an allergen comes into direct contact with the skin to cause a rash Cutaneous drug eruptions—skin reaction to a medication Allergic bronchitis ( feline asthma ) Common symptoms of allergies in cats include: Excessive scratching or licking, including overgrooming Sores, scabs, crusting, tiny lumps/bumps , or acne Areas of flat, reddened, swollen skin (eosinophilic plaques) Areas of hair loss or thinning hair, poor or unkempt hair coat Coughing , wheezing Shortness of breath/trouble breathing Sneezing Watery nasal discharge Upset stomach ( vomiting , diarrhea , change in appetite ) Blood in stool Weight loss Facial swelling (most common around the lips, nose, and eyes) Hives Anaphylaxis Difficulty breathing in cats is a veterinary emergency. If your cat is breathing with his mouth open or has labored breathing, seek veterinary care immediately. Cats can be allergic to a variety of things—so let’s look at the most common allergens to affect cats. The cause of food allergies in cats is poorly understood. Any protein, carbohydrate, preservative, additive, or dye can be potentially allergenic. Typically, a cat’s immune system is overstimulated by a protein. The most frequently reported allergies are beef, fish, and chicken. While cats can have allergies to grains, corn, or gluten, it is far less common than the main protein sources. Some studies indicate Siamese cats and cats under 6 months old may have higher rates of developing food allergies. Atopy, or environmental allergies, is characterized by inflamed, itchy skin disease. Genetic causes are not well documented in cats, but atopy occurs more often in Abyssinian , Devon Rex , and domestic short-haired cats less than 3 years old. The most common causes of atopy are: Pollen Mold spores Yeast Dust and storage mites Animal or human dander Allergic contact dermatitis is rare in cats and involves a delayed hypersensitive reaction at the site of contact with: Plants (pollen, grasses, trees) Medications (topical drugs, ear medications, soaps, shampoos, insecticides) Home furnishings (fibers, dyes, polishes, cleansers) Other (rice flour, chlorinated water) Flea allergic dermatitis occurs as a hypersensitive reaction to the flea’s saliva. Any drug can cause a cutaneous drug reaction. It can happen after one dose or multiple doses. More common drugs that cause a drug eruption include antibiotics, anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, NSAIDs, and antiarrhythmic drugs. Asthma occurs when a cat’s immune system overreacts to allergen in the air causing airway inflammation and constriction of the airway. Potential inciting allergens include: Cigarette smoke Poor environmental hygiene Dusty cat litter Hair spray Molds Pollen Powders Household chemicals Air fresheners Allergy tests for cats vary. Tests may include: Skin cytology Skin biopsy Patch test for contact dermatitis Intradermal skin testing Radiographs ( chest X-ray ) Elimination diet trial Novel protein diet Hydrolyzed diet Using a flea comb Blood work to look at white blood cells Depending on the cause of your cat’s allergies, treatment may include: Eliminating the offending food from your cat’s diet. Steroids ( prednisolone/prednisone ) Anti-diarrheal protocols including probiotics , a bland diet, and fiber and/or pectin supplementation Anti-nausea medication like Cerenia or Ondansetron Immunotherapy, or allergy vaccines Immunosuppressive therapy or drugs, like cyclosporine Immunomodulating drugs like oclacitinib ( Apoquel ) Antibiotics and antifungals for secondary infections (Convenia or itraconazole ) Pain medications (Onsior or gabapentin ) Topical therapy Antihistamines ( chlorpheniramine ) Flea and tick treatment Hypoallergenic shampoos and wipes Hospitalization Oxygen supplementation With time, the commitment of loving pet parents, and a close relationship with a veterinarian, cat allergies can be managed. Your cat can enjoy a good quality of life. Cat allergies can’t be cured, but with monitoring and early intervention if flare-ups do occur, cats can quickly return to normal. Risk factors, especially with cats with atopy, include environments with long allergy seasons and high pollen levels. Some allergies like flea allergies and contact dermatitis, become more severe and chronic as cats age. You can work with your vet to determine the best treatments to manage your cat’s allergies, given the specific diagnosis and their personality. Cats with allergies typically have skin issues and are itchy. This doesn’t mean they have allergies, but it is a possibility. Only testing with your veterinarian can determine if your cat has allergies. Always talk to your veterinarian before administering any medications or supplements. Based on your cat’s specific allergy, it may be treated with a combination of food and medications. Food allergy and environmental allergies are the most common.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/cataracts-cats,Cataracts in Cats,"Cataracts are changes to the clear lens inside the eye, causing it to take on a cloudy appearance. The lens is a translucent disc-like structure inside the eye. The lens helps to focus incoming light in the back of the eye on the retina. This picture is then sent to the brain to allow a cat to see the world around them. When a cataract develops, the lens is not able to focus the light down, leading to vision changes. Sometimes these changes are subtle, as is the case with small cataracts. Large, advanced cataracts may lead to blindness. Cataracts are more common in senior cats as they age and their lens degenerates over time. They can occur in one or both eyes. Cloudy, hazy appearance in one or both eyes Bumping into furniture Difficulty finding food or litter box Reluctance to move around in unfamiliar settings The most common cause of cataracts in cats is chronic uveitis . Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye that can result from an infection, disease, or trauma. Diseases like feline leukemia, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), and toxoplasma gondii may increase a cat’s risk of having chronic uveitis and subsequent cataracts. Trauma itself, like a penetrating injury to the eye, can also result in premature cataract formation. Cataracts can occur in cats of any age. While cats over age 10 more commonly get cataracts as a consequence of aging, younger cats can get them as well. Cataracts can even be diagnosed in some kittens due to malnutrition or an underlying inherited condition. Certain breeds are more predisposed to cataract formation, including Persian , Birman , Siamese , Russian Blue , and Himalayan cat breeds. Cataracts can also occur in cats undergoing radiation therapy for cancer on their face or head. Some underlying diseases, like high blood pressure and diabetes , have also been linked to cataract formation in cats. In dogs, diabetes is the most common underlying cause of cataracts. In cats, diabetic cataracts are relatively rare. Cataracts are diagnosed by an ophthalmic exam of the eyes. Your veterinarian will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to look at the lens inside the eye. Cataracts are not the only thing that can cause cloudiness inside the eye. Nuclear sclerosis is a common aging change that can also lead to an opaque color in the eye, but it does not affect vision. Your vet will be able to distinguish between the two conditions and determine with the ophthalmoscope if cataracts are present. This is most easily done in a dark room with the pupil fully dilated. If your cat is diagnosed with cataracts, your veterinarian will run several tests to rule out any underlying causes. Blood work, a blood pressure measurement, and a urinalysis will likely be recommended to screen for concurrent conditions. Cataracts can be removed with a surgery called phacoemulsification. This surgery is done by a veterinary ophthalmologist with special equipment that works with precision to break down and remove the old lens and replace it with a new, artificial lens. While there are no medications that will remove the cataracts, sometimes medications may be prescribed to delay progression of cataracts. This may be achieved by treating any contributing underlying diseases. For example, anti-inflammatory eye drops may be used to manage uveitis and reduce the risk of secondary glaucoma (high pressure in the eye) that can contribute to cataract progression. In cats who are good surgical candidates, cataracts can be cured with surgical removal. For non-surgical candidates, cataracts can be managed by reducing inflammation in the eye that may lead to secondary problems. For many cats, cataracts themselves are not painful and may not require any additional management aside from regular monitoring. If an underlying condition like uveitis, high blood pressure, or ocular pressure (glaucoma) is present, your veterinarian may recommend regular follow-up visits to track progression. Progression of cataracts can vary depending on the cause, how quickly intervention is sought, and the age of the patient. Sometimes cataracts remain small and do not change much over long periods of time, while other cats may experience sudden blindness. A young kitten with a juvenile cataract that was a consequence of a nutritional deficiency may have very little change to their small cataract and continue to have normal vision as long as their diet is corrected. A senior cat with elevated blood pressure and retinal issues with secondary cataracts may experience sudden blindness from cataract progression and/or retinal detachment. Your veterinarian will be able to give you a better idea of what to expect regarding the timeline, depending on the severity and type of cataract that is diagnosed. If your cat is diagnosed with cataracts and has lost some vision, it is important that you make sure they have easy access to all of their resources. Avoid putting necessary resources, like food and water, on high or unstable surfaces. Keep the food and water bowls and litter box in the same place, so your cat is not struggling to find them. Prevent access to potentially dangerous areas of the household like staircases or swimming pools. Avoid moving your furniture around and increasing disorientation in your vision-impaired cat. Remember, cats can live wonderful, full lives even if they do lose the ability to see. Cataracts are most common in senior cats over the age of 10. However, cats of any age can get cataracts in one or both eyes. Some pet parents may notice a cloudy appearance inside the eye, while others may observe behavior changes consistent with vision loss.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/cat-asthma,"Cat Asthma: What It Is, Symptoms, and Treatment","Jorge Aguado Martin/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Cats, too, can experience asthma just like people. The causes and treatment are similar, as are the symptoms and reduction in quality of life. Cat asthma and cat asthma attacks can be a scary thing to witness. Fortunately, this article includes everything you need to know about the disease and how it’s diagnosed. You’ll also learn how cat asthma is treated and how it can be managed at home. Cat asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation (swelling) of a cat’s lungs and narrowing of their airways. Asthma is triggered when a cat breathes in an allergen such as dust or pollen . This condition can be made worse by stress . Cats with asthma may show signs of coughing , difficulty breathing , and wheezing. Although these symptoms may come and go, depending on your cat’s allergens, asthma will not clear up without long-term treatment. Asthma is a medical emergency, especially if your cat is having an asthma attack. As symptoms progressively worsen over time, your cat should be taken to the vet at the first sign of coughing. If your cat has trouble breathing, you should seek immediate veterinary attention. Asthma in cats is a progressive disease. This means that symptoms will likely worsen with time, a cat’s quality of life will eventually become affected, and asthma attacks may occur quicker and last longer. However, as an allergic disease, asthma is highly individualized, meaning some cats may be more affected by it than others. While asthma can never be cured, the condition can be managed with appropriate medication and environmental modifications. Limiting potential allergens in the home can provide your cat with many good years of life. The most common signs include: Coughing, which can look like gagging or vomiting Difficulty breathing Breathing that looks like it is coming from the belly instead of the chest Increased respiratory rate Blue gums Noisy “wheezy” breathing If a cat is having an asthma attack, they’ll typically have a crouched posture with their head and neck extended while coughing or wheezing. Cat asthma is caused by an allergic reaction triggered when the cat inhales an allergen, such as: Dust Cigarette smoke Pollens Dust mites Mildew Cat litter Household chemicals Even being exposed to candles, hair spray, and room fresheners can trigger a flare-up in sensitive cats. If you notice your pet is showing cat asthma symptoms, like difficulty breathing, you should visit an emergency vet immediately. If your cat is coughing but still breathing normally, you can book a regular appointment. Once at your vet, your cat will usually have the following tests: Blood work Heartworm test Chest X-rays Some cats may also need more testing, which may include fecal tests for lung parasites as well as airway washes to investigate the cause of the lung inflammation. An airway wash—typically called a transtracheal wash (TTW) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)—is performed while a cat is under anesthesia . Saline is flushed through a catheter into a cat’s lungs and then suctioned back. This sample (which contains cells and mucus) is then sent off to be analyzed to help determine a cat asthma diagnosis. In most cases, a cat asthma diagnosis is easy and straightforward to make—but some cats will require more extensive testing than others. Because the primary problem involved in cat asthma is underlying inflammation, treatment is aimed at reducing this swelling. Typically, it’s not possible to eliminate the allergens your cat is inhaling. Even if your cat is not showing symptoms, they will need to take anti-inflammatory medication, with or without bronchodilators, such a terbutaline or albuterol , that help open the airways and reduce constriction. Steroids such as prednisolone or injectable Depo-Medrol may also be prescribed. Long term, the safest way to give this medication is using an inhaler , much as would be done for humans with asthma. Additionally, just as in people, limiting exposure (as much as possible) to inhaled irritants, like smoke and aerosols, could prove beneficial at reducing attacks. Using an air purifier in the home along with routine air filter changes can be beneficial. Switching to a dustless cat litter, like Tidy Cats Free & Clean Unscented Clumping Clay Cat Litter , can also help. Keeping your cat at a healthy body weight is also a benefit at reducing attacks. Some cats are treated with oral or injectable anti-inflammatories instead of inhaled medication. The risks of side effects are higher with the oral treatments, however, so inhalers are generally preferred. With proper care, most cats with asthma will respond to treatment well and may only experience occasional flare-ups of symptoms. However, even if your cat’s symptoms seem to disappear, it’s important to continue with treatment—the underlying inflammation is still simmering and can cause long-term disease. Cat asthma attacks can be a scary thing to witness. You can help your cat by doing the following three steps: Remain calm and limit surrounding stressors for your cat. This may mean preventing other animals and people from coming near your cat and creating a calm and quiet environment. Follow the directions of your veterinarian for how to administer rescue medication. If you have portable oxygen that has been prescribed, follow the instructions on how to use it properly. Get your cat to the nearest veterinary hospital as soon as possible. After diagnosis, asthma is usually treated at home using inhaled anti-inflammatory medications daily, with a rescue inhaler to use if there’s a significant flare-up. Some cats will be treated (at least short-term) with oral medications in addition to, or instead of, inhalers. Yes. Just as untreated asthma in humans can be fatal, the same is true in cats. Some cats with asthma will cough and look like they are trying to bring up a hairball. Other cats will have an audible wheeze when breathing. The cost to treat a cat with asthma depends on which medication your vet prescribes, where you choose to have that prescription filled, and the severity of the asthma. In all cases, however, proper treatment will likely be much less expensive than a single visit to an emergency facility for a cat that is struggling to breathe. Asthma is a disease of the lungs, while hairballs come from the stomach. When cats with hairballs vomit their back is arched, and they vomit up fluid and hair, often while walking backward. When cats with asthma cough: their neck and back are straight and parallel to the floor, and they don’t usually move backward while coughing. If you are not sure which symptom your cat has, it is best to video the event to show your veterinarian what is happening.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/cat-colds,"Cat Colds: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","Wirestock/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Cats don’t get the same types of colds that humans get, but they do have upper respiratory diseases that are sometimes called “colds”. A “cat cold” is a general term that refers to a group of symptoms in cats that are like the common cold in humans. Cold symptoms in cats are usually caused by a virus. Cats with colds may have symptoms including: Coughing Sneezing Discharge from the eyes or nose Lethargy Fever Sores in the mouth Corneal ulcers For many cats, these symptoms will go away on their own in about seven to 10 days. However, some cats may experience complications, such as a secondary bacterial infection or pneumonia . A secondary bacterial infection can cause yellow-green discharge from the eyes or nose, which may lead to congestion severe enough that your cat can’t smell or taste, affecting their appetite . Cats with pneumonia will cough and have difficulty breathing that may require hospitalization. The most common causes of cat colds are viral infections. It’s estimated that about 90% are caused by the feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus . Feline herpesvirus (or feline rhinotracheitis virus) is extremely contagious. It is commonly seen in situations where multiple cats are housed together (such as a rescue or shelter). Cats infected with herpesvirus will carry it for the rest of their lives. Many cats will experience dormant periods where the virus is not actively reproducing. They may look perfectly healthy during this time. However, after stressful events that suppress the immune system, such as being boarded or groomed, the virus may become active and cause symptoms including sneezing or runny eyes for a few days. Cats that are infected with feline calicivirus may show very similar signs to cats that are infected with feline herpesvirus. Like herpesvirus, calicivirus is highly contagious. When compared with feline herpesvirus, cats with calicivirus are also more likely to develop oral symptoms, such as ulcers (sores) in the mouth. Fortunately, both viral infections are specific to cats and are not contagious to people. Additionally, there are vaccines for both viruses, and these viruses are considered core vaccines for kittens and adult cats. Although the vaccine may not prevent infection completely, it can help to reduce symptoms and prevent serious disease. If your cat is showing symptoms of a viral infection, your cat’s veterinarian will perform a thorough examination. It’s important that you give your vet a thorough medical history about your cat, including the onset and nature of your cat’s symptoms. Based on their exam findings, your veterinarian may recommend routine diagnostic tests to check for possible complications of a cold. These tests may include blood work and chest X-rays to check for pneumonia or other conditions like asthma or a fungal infection. For cats with recurrent, severe upper respiratory signs, an upper respiratory PCR panel may be recommended by your cat’s veterinarian to figure out what virus or bacteria is causing her symptoms. This test is performed by collecting secretions from the eyes and nose with swabs and submitting them to a laboratory, where they are analyzed for pathogens that cause respiratory disease. For cats with mild symptoms, a PCR test isn’t usually performed. Mild cases of cat colds typically don’t require any medical treatment, but there are some things that you can do at home to help your cat feel better while she is recovering. These include: Keep your cat with you in the bathroom while you take a hot shower. The humidity can help relieve nasal congestion. If the air in your home is dry (during winter for example), use a humidifier to help relieve airway irritation. Reduce your cat’s stress during recovery. This may mean keeping her confined to a smaller, quiet room with all of her essentials close by ( litter box , food, water, and warm bed ) and using pheromone products . Severe cases, or cases where a secondary bacterial infection is also present, often require antibiotics. Typically, this will be in the form of topical and/or oral medication that is administered at home. Antiviral medications are sometimes used in cats suspected of having herpesvirus, especially if the signs are severe or they have other immunocompromising conditions like feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) . If your cat is sick enough that she is having trouble breathing or she's refusing to eat, she may require hospitalization for one to two days until she is stable enough to continue treatment at home. Most healthy cats can make a full recovery from a cat cold without medical intervention in about seven to 10 days. If your cat experiences more severe symptoms and medical treatment is required, the recovery period may last longer and be more difficult. No, the main causes of feline upper respiratory infections are not transmissible to humans. You should not use over the counter medications for cats without speaking with your veterinarian.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/cat-constipation-symptoms-causes,Cat Constipation: Symptoms and Causes,"iStock/CasarsaGuru Constipation is defined as infrequent or difficult defecation. This may mean hard stool; large, uncomfortable pellets; or no production of poop at all. Cat constipation is a short-term problem. If your cat continues to be constipated, it can become obstipation (painful defecation) or even megacolon , which is the advanced stage of chronic cat constipation that is often non-responsive to medical management. If your cat is straining when in their litter box, this could be a sign of a medical emergency—contact your vet immediately. The underlying cause could possibly be serious or deadly if untreated. Health Tools Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps. Symptoms that your cat is constipated may include: Little to no fecal production while attempting to poop. This is otherwise known as straining and is often a sign of pain or discomfort. Frequent visits to the litter box. With constipation, cats will often have a sense of urgency to try and have a bowel movement often hence they will frequent the litter box more than usual. Vomiting. Vomiting can occur from a sense of feeling full due to extra feces present in the digestive tract. It can also be caused by nausea from upset stomach or abdominal pain. Decreased appetite. Constipation is often uncomfortable and can cause nausea, thus cats will choose not to eat to help relieve themselves or to tell you they are not feeling well. Abdominal pain. Abdominal pain is caused by the excessive amount of stool, gas, and distension caused by constipation. Constipation can also cause an intestinal blockage which is often painful . Decreased energy . Abdominal pain and gas causing pain can also contribute to less activity . Decreased interest in interacting with family. This is a common general symptom that occurs when a cat is not feeling well. Cats often isolate themselves to try and resolve their issue or as a way of telling you they do not feel well. Cats can become constipated for many reasons, from stressful situations to health issues. You should always see the vet within 24 hours to rule out health-related causes or underlying diseases. Sometimes cat constipation starts with a litter box issue: maybe the box isn’t cleaned frequently enough or isn’t easy to access or there is a new type of cat litter in the box. Or if the litter box is associated with pain while attempting to poop such as cats with arthritis, or with something that’s scary to a cat, like the washing machine buzzer going off. Your cat might choose to hold their stool instead of passing it in a normal amount of time due to the scary noise of where the litter box is placed. In these cases, your cat not wanting to go can quickly become not being able to go—thus constipation occurs. To help your constipated cat, examine your litter box and its surroundings, and consider: Moving it to a quiet location with no noises or activity that would be scary to your cat Moving it away from your cat’s food, water, and bed Cleaning it more often to reduce smells Using the same kind of litter (brand, odor, and clumping ability) exclusively Switching to a low-sided litter box that is easier to access Cat constipation could also be caused by not drinking enough water . Your cat’s reluctance to drink might be related to an underlying health concern such as mobility issues, mouth pain, or digestive discomfort. Take them to the vet to rule out any of these issues. Your cat might also be reacting to an issue with their water dish, such as stagnant or dirty water, or even the type of bowl. Always rule out medical issues first, especially when it comes to dehydration . Then you can also think about: Many diseases, both acute (short-term) and chronic, can lead to cat constipation. These include kidney disease, diabetes , and hyperthyroidism . All cases of straining in the litter box should be evaluated by a veterinarian, because each of these illnesses can become serious or even deadly if left untreated. A toy or other nonfood item can obstruct the intestines, preventing the passage of poop. This is considered an emergency. If your cat is constipated and shows any symptoms of obstruction , take them to the vet immediately. Symptoms of an obstruction may include: The inability to urinate or straining to urinate is also an emergency for your cat; take them to see a vet as quickly as possible to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. Inactivity can also lead to cat constipation. You should aim for at least 10-15 minutes of activity interactive play with your cat per day, or more if you have a younger cat or kitten. Some ways to incorporate play for cats can include: First, your veterinarian will want a history of your cat. You’ll need to describe the symptoms, when they started, and other factors that may be related to your cat’s constipation. Providing a full history is very important because straining in the litter box can also be a symptom of lower urinary issues and diarrhea. After getting your cat’s history, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam. In constipated cats, a vet can often feel the hard stool, but not always. Next, your veterinarian will recommend X-rays to evaluate the extent of constipation to determine the best initial treatment for your cat. Bloodwork is often required to assess underlying diseases that may predispose your cat to constipation. Treatment for constipated cats depends on the cause and severity. Constipation that is left untreated can lead to megacolon, a form of constipation that is not responsive to medical treatment and can be fatal. The first step in treatment is to remove the obstructing feces, which sometimes requires administration of fluids or an enema at the clinic. Never give an enema to your cat at home, as human enemas are not safe for cats. If the constipation is moderate or severe, your cat will need to be sedated for the enema or deobstipation (manual removal of feces). The next step is to determine the underlying cause of your cat’s constipation and address it. You may need to make changes in your cat’s environment, like moving the litter boxes, cleaning the water bowl or litter boxes more often, or trying a cat water fountain or a different type of water bowl. The vet may also recommend switching your cat to low- or fiber-enhanced food and adding medication specifically for constipation. But more often, treating any underlying disease, such as kidney disease or arthritis, is the most important treatment to prevent a recurrence. Once the hard stool is removed, recovery is usually rapid. Unfortunately, if you don’t deal with the original cause, whether it’s treating a health issue or making lifestyle changes, then your cat is likely to become constipated again. Follow the instructions provided by your veterinarian. Often the food changes or medications will need to be continued for life. Just because your cat is feeling better doesn’t mean you can stop treatment. Pro Tip: Hang a calendar on the wall near the litter box to keep track of your cat’s poop schedule. This will help you be proactive at the first sign of a problem. A common sign that your cat is constipated is when they are producing little to no stool in a 24 hour period as well as straining. Straining is when they posture to defecate and little to no stool comes out. Constipation can also cause bleeding from the rectum, small/firm fecal balls produced, or other general signs of illness such as vomiting, diarrhea, or change in appetite. When a cat has started vomiting due to constipation, this is a serious sign that they need medical attention. Vomiting is a sign of an intestinal obstruction likely caused by the impacted stool. If you notice these signs, contact an emergency vet immediately. Most cats poop at least once a day. Your cat should be having a normal bowel movement every 12-24 hours to ensure that their digestive system is working properly.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/ears/c_ct_cat_ear_hematoma,Cat Ear Hematoma,"An ear hematoma is an accumulation of blood caught between the ear’s cartilage and skin. Most cat ears stand upright because of a strip of cartilage in the ear, which is covered with skin. There are also many arteries, veins, and nerves in this area. The external part of the ear that we can see is called the pinna . Head shaking and scratching can cause small areas of skin to detach from the underlying cartilage, as well as damage the cartilage itself. The traumatized blood vessels leak blood into the space between the cartilage and skin, resulting in a puffy, soft, fluid-filled area of the ear. This swollen, blood-filled area can be limited to a section of the ear or entirely consume it. Even once the ear has healed, scar tissue and fibrosis may form, giving the ear a wrinkled appearance. People often call this a cauliflower ear . Hematomas usually appear on the underside of the ear. These fluid-filled sacs can be small—just a few millimeters—or involve the entire ear. Frequently, only one ear is affected. The swelling is soft, movable, and compressible, and may be red or painful to the touch. Cats with ear hematomas may display the following clinical signs: Head shaking Scratching at the ears Head tilt Ear pain Ear discharge and odor Dirty, inflamed ear canals Swollen, red, and ulcerated pinna The most common cause of ear hematomas in cats is trauma from head shaking or scratching secondary to otitis externa , or external ear inflammation, generally due to an ear infection. The fluid in ear infections is typically a mix of bacteria and yeast but may have an underlying allergic component. Other possible reasons for the head shaking and scratching that causes hematomas include: Ear mites (to which kittens and outside cats are most prone) Trauma or injury from fights or bites Foreign material, polyps, or cancer that cause otitis externa Fragile blood vessels in some conditions, such as Cushing’s disease An immune-mediated hematoma formation is also possible, but much less likely. An ear hematoma is typically suspected on physical exam. A veterinarian may notice a soft, fluid-filled pouch on the ear, usually with a history of head shaking or scratching. While the diagnosis of fluid in the ear is done on exam, a sample of the fluid may be required to confirm the presence of blood. It is important to note that while fluid testing is required for a confirmed diagnosis of ear hematoma, it is not required for treatment in all cases. In fact, in some cases, draining the blood with a needle may make the condition worse and the ear will fill with even more fluid. A veterinarian may perform additional tests to get to the underlying cause of the hematoma: Cytology of the ear canals is performed to look for yeast mites or bacteria, since most hematomas are secondary to ear infection. A complete otic (ear) exam will rule out foreign material or growths in the ear canal, and visualize the ear drums for any tears. Blood tests are conducted to rule out any underlying metabolic diseases. Many small ear hematomas resolve on their own if the underlying condition, like an ear infection, is appropriately treated. Often, treatment of the infection, anti-inflammatories, and pain medications are all that is needed to treat a cat’s ear hematoma. It is uncommon for ear hematomas to resolve on their own without medical intervention. Most often, a small hematoma will continue to grow as it becomes more irritating to the cat, causing additional and more aggressive head shaking and scratching. Some veterinarians may place an open drain, or cannula, in larger hematomas. This allows for any blood to immediately drain. Eventually, the cartilage and vessels repair themselves, and the drain is removed. As one can imagine, this method is messy, and pet parents should expect their pet to wear an e-collar and be confined to a room. Another nonsurgical option is to drain the blood and inject a steroid into the space. The ear will likely refill with blood quickly, but the steroid may help long-term. Some cats may need systemic antibiotics in addition to any topical treatments used for ear infections. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Meloxicam or Onsior, is sometimes needed for pain management as well as to decrease inflammation within the ear canal. These medications can have serious side effects and should only be used for short periods of time. More serious cases of ear hematoma may require a steroid to decrease the inflammation. However, steroids have well-known side effects in cats, such as diabetes, so should be used as a last resort, and with caution. Cold laser therapy may also help speed up the healing process. Surgery may be indicated in some conditions, and for chronic issues. The surgeon uses suture material to tack down the ear cartilage throughout the entire ear. How Much Does Cat Hematoma Surgery Cost? Ear hematoma surgery may cost less than $1,000, if performed by a general practitioner. However, a specialist may charge two or three times that amount, depending on the location. Any infection present will likely need to be rechecked every 1 to 2 weeks until resolved. If not drained, the ear hematoma may take longer to resorb and go away. As long as the cause of head shaking and scratching is fixed, the hematoma should not get worse on its own—but may take weeks to fully heal. Recurrence is possible, depending on the underlying cause. Surgical pet patients require recheck appointments, as well as incision management, for approximately two weeks, in addition to treating any other infections. Tilley LP, Smith FWK.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/ears/cat-ear-infections,Cat Ear Infections,"Otitis externa , commonly referred to as an ear infection, is an inflammation (swelling) of the outer ear canal. This inflammation may be acute (more recent) or chronic (long-standing). Otitis externa is a common condition in cats, less common in dogs, and it has a variety of causes. The cat’s ear is divided into three main sections: The outer ear The middle ear The inner ear The eardrum separates the outer ear canal from the middle and inner ear, which houses very sensitive structures involved in hearing and balance. Chronic and severe outer ear infections can eventually become more serious infections of the middle or inner ear. The outer ear includes the pinna, or the cartilaginous triangle part of the ear that is covered by skin, and the external ear canal. The pinna is shaped like a funnel to help sound waves get into the ear, down the ear canal, and into the parts of the ear that process sounds. Cats have very sensitive hearing, partly because of a larger canal as compared to humans. A deeper canal allows better processing of sound. However, a deeper ear canal may get more dirt and wax, contributing to infection and irritation. The ear canal is lined by skin and has varying degrees of hair. The deep part of the ear canal is a dark, often moist environment that can be a breeding ground for yeast and bacteria. Cats with ear infections may experience differences in severity and length of infection. Most often, cats will have these symptoms: Head shaking Scratching the ears Head tilt Ear discharge and odor Swollen, red, and possibly ulcerated (having sores) pinna Ear pain Depending on the cause, ear infections may affect one or both ears. It is more common for both ears to be affected. As the infection and inflammation progress to the inner and middle ears, cats may show signs of incoordination and vestibular issues. The vestibular system is involved in balance, motion, and orientation. Problems with the vestibular system are similar to vertigo in humans. They may also injure the pinna to the point of developing an ear hematoma (pool of blood). Otitis externa has many causes. Predisposing factors, such as abnormal ear shape (like in Scottish fold cats) may increase the risk of ear infections. Cats with too much wax production, lots of ear hair, or abnormally small ear canals may also be predisposed. Ear mites are common causes of ear infections in cats. Kittens and outdoor cats are more susceptible, because mites can spread between cats and dogs. Allergies are also a common cause of ear inflammation and infection in cats. Cats may have an allergic reaction to food, the environment, or both. Cats typically have signs of skin disease with allergies and, because the ear canal is lined with skin, the ears can also be affected. Bacteria and yeast are typically secondary and opportunistic infections. This means the primary problem is not the yeast or bacteria, but these pathogens take advantage of the weak and damaged ear canal in order to replicate, thereby causing additional disease. Healthy ear canals can fight off and defend against bacterial and yeast overgrowth, but that ability is lost when it becomes diseased. The secondary infections are some of the most common types of ear infections. The other causes of ear inflammation, and things likely to create secondary infections include: Foreign bodies (grass awns or hair) Polyps Cancer Disorders of the skin Endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease) Immune-mediated disorders Sebaceous gland disorders Aggressive ear cleaning Inappropriate treatments or medications not intended for the ear, such as hydrogen peroxide or alcohol can cause inflammation. Even some medications designed for use in the ear may cause problems if not prescribed by a vet, so it’s always important to check with your vet before using any medication on your cat. Veterinarians will suspect an ear infection based on a cat’s ear exam and the clinical signs. The ear canal and eardrum are checked for signs of inflammation, debris, masses, or other abnormalities. In more severe cases, the eardrum can rupture, which may change the treatments. Veterinarians can diagnose ear inflammation and debris based on a physical exam alone, but more tests may be needed to confirm the presence of bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections. These include: Cytology is the gold standard to diagnose ear infections. A swab is inserted into the affected ear to collect cells, debris, and discharge. These cells are then examined under a microscope for the presence of mites, bacteria, yeast, or inflammatory abnormal cells. Culture of the affected ears involves inserting a sterile swab into the affected ear to obtain a sample of bacteria. These bacteria are then grown in a laboratory setting and tested against other different strains of bacteria to see which type your pet is most sensitive to. Imaging and other tests may be necessary for chronic or cases that don’t respond to treatment. Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause of the infection, as well as treating any secondary infections. Cold laser therapy is often used, along with medications to help treat pain and decrease inflammation. Ear mites : Topical antiparasitic medications, like Revolution , are often used to treat ear mites . Some topical antiparasitic drugs may also be placed directly into the ear canal as well. Allergies : There are many ways to treat allergies, but the first step is to figure out if it is an environmental allergy or a food allergy . Diet trials may be used as well as specialized testing to find potential allergens. The goal with allergy testing is to produce an allergy vaccine with an allergen profile specific to the pet patient. Bacterial and yeast infections : These are typically secondary to an underlying cause, but they still require treatment. Most often, medications containing an antibiotic, an antifungal, and an anti-inflammatory all in one are put into the affected ear canal. Some otic (ear) preparations are intended to stay in the ear canal for 1 to 2 weeks. Others may need to be administered daily, or twice daily by pet parents. Ear cleaning is an important part of treating otitis externa. Debris left in the ear canal can continue the infection and make treatment more difficult. To clean the ear, fill the canal with the cleaner and gently massage, wiping out what you can feel in the vertical part of the ear (feels like an ice cream cone). You could do damage if you try to go deeper. For appropriate and accurate treatment, make sure to talk to your veterinarian about the correct way to give medication and clean your cat’s ears. Many veterinarians recommend Epi-otic for cleaning, but always check with your vet before starting any medications or supplements. In more severe cases, oral anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids or NSAIDS) may be needed to decrease inflammation and treat pain. Oral antibiotics and antifungals may also be needed in severe, chronic, or recurrent cases of otitis. Surgery may be needed for tumors, foreign bodies, or polyps in the ear canal. Ear cleaning at home can be an important part of helping your cat’s ears stay healthy and finding problems early. While there are many over-the-counter products that claim to treat ear issues, the ear is a very sensitive organ. Many products are toxic to the ear and may result in pain, hearing loss, ulcerations (breaks in the skin), and even neurologic signs. It is always best to have your veterinarian diagnose and treat any ear issues. Cats usually start feeling better within a few days of treatment. Once they seem to recover, it could be tempting to stop treatment, or cancel follow-up appointments. However, all medications should be used for the full treatment length (usually 7 to 14 days) and a recheck exam with cytology should be scheduled. Common causes of treatment failure include treatment that’s not long enough and inadequate therapy. It is important to learn how to clean and medicate your cat’s ears to ensure the product reaches the deep part of the ear canal. The recheck cytology and veterinary exam is important because it may show one or more of the following things: The ear infection is better, but not fully resolved (even if the pet is feeling completely fine). The ear infection is resolved, and treatment can be stopped. The ear infection has changed and now requires a different course of treatment. Some cats may have recurring ear infections, especially if they have abnormal ear canal anatomy or chronic predisposing issues, like allergies. Other issues, such as foreign material or ear mites, are more readily cured and do not recur. In general, cats with ear infections have a good prognosis. Early intervention, fully completing any medications, and treating underlying factors are the keys to success. Veterinary Manual. Ear Structure and Function in Cats . Veterinary Information Network.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_exocrine_pancreatic_insufficiency,Cat Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI in Cats),"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in cats affects a cat’s pancreas and occurs when most of the cells that produce digestive hormones don’t function normally. The pancreas is a small organ located under the stomach, alongside the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum). A cat’s pancreas has two vital functions: Producing insulin—the hormone that moves sugar from the bloodstream into cells. Producing digestive hormones—including lipase to break down fat, proteases to break down protein, and amylase to break down starch. Different cells within the pancreas perform these different functions. So when these cells start to malfunction or stop functioning, cats can get sick in different ways. For example, when enough insulin-producing cells are damaged, cats develop Type I diabetes . And when the cells that make the digestive hormones aren’t working properly, cats suffer from EPI. Unfortunately, there is no cure for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cats. Once the pancreas is damaged to the point that symptoms of EPI develop, you must give your cat pancreatic enzyme supplements and other appropriate treatments for the rest of your cat’s life. But the good news is that dedicated pet parents can expect that—with appropriate treatment—their cat will go on to enjoy a long and happy life. A study published in 2016 details the most common symptoms of cat EPI and the percentages of cats in the study that showed these symptoms 1 : Weight loss (91%) Unformed feces (62%) Poor hair coat (50%) Anorexia (45%) Increased appetite (42%) Lethargy (40%) Watery diarrhea (28%) Vomiting (19%) The frequency of these symptoms is somewhat different than what we’ve seen in the past and what is commonly seen in EPI in dogs . The same study also found that most cats (58%) suffered from at least one other health problem in addition to EPI. When this is the case, additional symptoms are also possible. For example, a cat with both EPI and diabetes mellitus could lose weight, have soft stools, and drink and urinate more than normal. Anything that damages a large part of the pancreas can cause exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cats. Chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is by far the most common cause of EPI in cats. Other possible causes include: Birth defects Cancer affecting the pancreas Obstruction of the duct that connects the pancreas to the intestinal tract Cats who eat grasshoppers can be infected with a pancreatic fluke (a type of parasite) that, in severe cases, can damage enough of the pancreas to result in EPI. Genetics does not appear to play a big role in whether a cat develops EPI. No cat breeds are at higher risk than others, and the disease can affect cats of any age. 2 The symptoms that are commonly associated with EPI in cats are also seen with many other diseases. To diagnose EPI, a veterinarian will need to run some laboratory tests. Blood chemistry tests and a complete blood cell count will give a picture of the cat’s overall health and are used to look for problems, like anemia (a low red blood cell count), that are sometimes associated with EPI. Over half of cats with EPI also suffer from another disease, so a general health workup is necessary to reach a complete diagnosis and plan appropriate treatment. 1,3 The best test specifically for EPI in cats is the trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) test. Trypsin is a digestive enzyme produced by the pancreas that is normally present at low levels in the bloodstream. In cats with EPI, blood-trypsin levels are significantly lower than normal. The test is easy to perform by drawing blood, but cats cannot eat for 8-12 hours before the sample is taken. Deficiencies in vitamin B12 (also called cobalamin) and alterations in folate levels (another type of B vitamin) are very common in cats with EPI. Your veterinarian will also send a sample to the lab to measure blood levels of these (and possibly other) important vitamins. Treatment for EPI centers around replacing the cat’s missing digestive enzymes, giving cobalamin supplements , and managing any other abnormalities. Some cats will also need folate supplements and antibiotics. Pancreatic enzymes should be added to every meal. Powdered pancreatic enzyme supplements like PancrePlus Powder for dogs and cats , Thomas Labs Bio Case Pancreatic Enzyme Powder dog and cat supplement , and PanaKare Plus Powder for dogs and cats are easy to use and usually effective. Tablets are also available, but they don’t seem to work as well as the powders. The powder should be mixed thoroughly into your cat’s food because it can irritate their mouth. Some pet parents say that letting the food sit for a period of time to allow “predigestion” improves their cat’s response to treatment. Research doesn’t seem to back this up, but it doesn’t hurt to try if your cat’s condition isn’t improving as expected. Initially, you will follow the dosage instructions on the label or provided by your veterinarian, but once your cat’s symptoms are well-controlled, the goal is often to find the smallest amount of enzyme supplement that works for your cat. Another source of pancreatic enzymes is … pancreas meat from another animal. Pet parents can purchase the organ meat from butchers, raw pet food suppliers, and other sources, but the handling and feeding of raw animal products increases the risk of foodborne illnesses like salmonellosis for everyone in the house. A commonly recommended starting dose for pancreas meat is 1 ounce mixed with each meal, but follow your veterinarian’s recommendation, because it will be based on the specifics of your cat’s case. Pancreas meat can be ground up and frozen in appropriate portions and then thawed before being mixed thoroughly with each meal. Whether they are delivered in powder form or via pancreas meat, most pancreatic enzymes are broken down in the stomach. A medication that decreases stomach acid, like omeprazole, may be used if this is a concern. Most cats with EPI need injections of cobalamin (vitamin B12) every few weeks at the beginning of treatment. As their condition stabilizes, injections can usually be spaced further apart. Switching to an oral supplement may also be possible. Folate supplementation is sometimes necessary, at least in the short term. Your veterinarian will monitor your cat’s vitamin levels on a regular basis to make sure they don’t become deficient again. Some cats with EPI also develop an overgrowth of bacteria in their intestinal tract , which can be managed with antibiotics (often Tylosin ). Many cats only require antibiotic treatment for a month or two as their condition improves, but some may benefit from long-term therapy. After proper treatment is started, most cats with EPI start feel better quickly. Their symptoms usually improve over the course of a few days to weeks. If that’s not the case for your cat, discuss other treatment options with your veterinarian. If your cat continues to respond poorly to treatment, it’s possible that they could be suffering from more than one health problem, and additional diagnostic testing may be necessary. Your veterinarian may recommend other treatments based on a cat’s symptoms and additional health concerns. You can also ask your veterinarian if switching to a different diet makes sense. There is no one type of diet that benefits all cats with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Because many cats with EPI also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease 4 , switching to a hypoallergenic diet like Hill's Prescription Diet z/d Original Skin/Food Sensitivities canned cat food may be worth a try. Image: Tyler Olson via Shutterstock Cats with EPI can do well on many different high-quality foods. Changing your cat’s diet is not always necessary. Because many cats with EPI also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease4, some veterinarians will recommend switching to a hypoallergenic diet like Hill's Prescription Diet z/d Original Skin/Food Sensitivities canned cat food . 1.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/food-allergies-cats,"Cat Food Allergies: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","iStock/eclipse_images Food allergies are rare in cats—but they can cause several symptoms that involve both the digestive system and the skin. They’re the third most common allergy in felines, behind flea allergies and environmental allergies (such as pollen, dust, grass, storage mites, etc). Picking the right food for your cat’s allergy is an important decision that should be made in collaboration with your veterinarian. A food allergy in cats is when a feline’s immune system overreacts to a food substance it has previously been exposed to. The immune system will create antibodies to a previously harmless protein, causing an inflammatory response in a cat’s body, which causes symptoms such as itching, sores , and sometimes gastrointestinal (GI) upset . For a cat to have a food allergy to a specific ingredient, they must have ingested that ingredient in the past. Food allergies are rare in cats. It’s estimated that just 1% of all cats have food allergies, and up to 15% of itchy cats. Of cats with both itching and gastrointestinal symptoms, up to 42% could be food allergic. While most cats with food allergies are over 1 year of age, studies have shown that cats of any age (or gender) can develop this issue. There is some evidence that Siamese cats and Siamese mix breeds are more prone to food allergies than other breeds. The most common symptom of a food allergy in cats is constant itching that does not change or stop seasonally. Itching can occur anywhere on the body, but the head and neck are most often involved. Symptoms may also include: Licking Scratching Overgrooming Biting Skin lesions may also be present, which may include: Small crusts (miliary dermatitis) Redness Papules Self-induced trauma (sores due to biting, scratching, or licking) Self-induced hair loss (due to biting, scratching, or licking) Ulcerations Plaques (raised circular nodules) Less commonly, there may be GI symptoms, including diarrhea and/or vomiting . Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. A food allergy in cats can develop at any age, even if a feline has been eating the same food for a long period of time with no problems. Most known food allergies in cats are due to an abnormal reaction to proteins in food. Let’s look at some common foods that cause allergies, but note that food allergies in cats can be caused by any food substance and are not limited to these items. Food sources that most commonly cause food allergies in cats are: Beef Fish Chicken Food sources that cause a food allergy in cats less commonly include: Dairy Lamb Egg Barley Rabbit Veterinarians typically diagnose food allergies in cats by doing a food elimination trial, which involves two steps: Feed a strict hypoallergenic diet for eight to 12 weeks. After eight to 12 weeks, if your cat’s symptoms show great improvement, then reintroduce your cat’s original diet. If your cat’s symptoms recur, then this confirms the diagnosis of food allergy. Two types of diets can be used for your cat’s hypoallergenic food trial. Your vet may recommend either a: Novel protein , which is a diet made with a protein source that your cat has never had before. Novel protein diets may include fish, duck, venison, or even alligator. Or Hydrolyzed diet , which is a diet made with proteins that have been broken down into tiny amino acids so as not to trigger an allergic reaction While there are tests on the market to diagnose food allergies that involve collecting blood, hair, or saliva, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate in clinical studies . To ensure an accurate hypoallergenic diet trial for your cat: Provide your vet with your cat’s complete diet history . This will help them with monitoring your cat’s response to a hypoallergenic food trial. The choice of what kind of diet your vet recommends depends on this. Do not feed your cat anything else . Avoid additional treats, protein-flavored medications, or even certain formulations of medications (such as gelatin capsules). None of these can be given because they may trigger an allergic reaction. Be patient . Some food-allergic cats who fail to respond to one diet may improve on another diet. Remember, the hypoallergenic diet trial process takes time. Don’t give up! The treatment for a food allergy in cats is to feed a diet that does not contain any allergy-inducing ingredients specifically for your cat, based off of a successful hypoallergenic diet trial. The specific food sources you may be able to feed your cat can vary greatly. Veterinary diets (which need authorization by a veterinarian) are the best choice when performing a hypoallergenic diet trial because they have strict quality control. Examples of veterinary diets your vet may prescribe for your cat include: Hydrolyzed protein diet, such as Blue Buffalo Natural Veterinary Diet HF Hydrolyzed for Food Intolerance , Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Adult Hydrolyzed Protein HP , or Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets HA Hydrolyzed . Over-the-counter cat food can contain contaminants from other proteins, which can still trigger an allergic reaction (e.g., a duck-based food might be made in the same machine as a chicken food and if the cat is allergic to chicken, the cat will then react to a duck food). Over-the-counter diets can also have other protein-containing ingredients that would cause a food-allergic cat to flare up with symptoms. In certain situations, your vet may recommend an over-the-counter diet formulated by a reputable pet food company, containing a single-source protein, such as: Blue Buffalo True Solutions Skin & Coat Care Natural Salmon Dry Cat Food Blue Buffalo True Solutions Perfect Skin & Coat Natural Whitefish Wet Cat Food Blue Buffalo Basics Skin & Stomach Care Grain-Free Duck & Potato Dry Cat Food Most cats are very itchy when starting a hypoallergenic food trial, so symptomatic treatment may be necessary. It takes at least eight to 12 weeks for the old food to leave a cat’s system and the new food to take over. Low-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisolone , are often used for this purpose. Any secondary bacterial or yeast infections must also be treated with antibiotics (like Convenia ) and/or antifungals (such as itraconazole ), and repeated treatments may be necessary. The most common food allergens in cats are animal proteins. Chicken, fish, and beef are the top three proteins that cause food allergy symptoms in cats. Cats are also commonly allergic to milk products. Yes, the most common food allergy in cats is to animal proteins—which includes chicken. Chicken allergies commonly cause itchy skin and skin issues but can also cause an upset stomach as well. To determine what foods your cat is allergic to, a hypoallergenic elimination diet trial should be performed. Starting a veterinary diet with either a novel protein or hydrolyzed protein for a minimum of eight to 12 weeks can help determine what foods your cat might be allergic to. A diet trial and all diets changes should always be a joint decision between you and your veterinarian. Yes, a cat allergy can cause diarrhea. While it is more common for cats with a food allergy to have itching and skin issues, studies show around 18% of cats with food allergies have digestive symptoms, including diarrhea and vomiting.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_lipoma,Cat Lipomas,"Lipomas are classically known as the “fatty tumor” of the animal world, and there is much truth to this nickname. They arise from fat cells and are benign, slow-growing, noncancerous tumors. While lipomas are common in dogs , they are encountered far less frequently in cats. When they are seen in cats, the patient is typically middle-aged or older. Although only one mass may be present, cats that do develop lipomas will often develop more than one. The lesion is most likely found on a cat’s chest, abdomen, neck, back, and upper legs, though no location is off limits. They are found most often in the subcutaneous tissues beneath the skin, though they can grow on internal organs as well. To the touch, lipomas in cats are most often soft and somewhat moveable, but they can also be firmer and more adhered to the nearby tissues. They should be the same temperature as the nearby skin, and the skin above them should appear normal and without lesions. When they grow quite large, which happens less in cats than dogs, they can outgrow their blood supply and become necrotic (tissue death). We don’t fully understand why cats get lipomas, and why dogs get so many more than cats. Obese and overweight cats are more likely to develop lipomas than those with healthy body conditions. Any new or changing mass on a cat should always be evaluated by your veterinarian, and a suspected lipoma is no different. Your veterinarian will likely recommend a test called a fine-needle aspirate (FNA) and cytology. Most veterinarians will perform this test in-house, though it may be sent out to a reference laboratory. For this test, the veterinarian inserts a needle into part of the mass to obtain a sampling of cells. The cells are “smeared” onto a microscope slide, stained, and prepared for microscopic examination. Lipomas are often easily diagnosed by classic appearance under the microscope. For a confirmative diagnosis, a larger tissue simple called a biopsy is necessary. This is a slightly more invasive procedure requiring a brief surgery, though it’s still extremely safe. Most lipomas only require monitoring. There is usually no reason for treatment of cat lipomas, as they pose no threat unless they are uncomfortable due to large size or an awkward location. The growth of most lipomas is quite slow, which gives you time before making a hasty decision to have a lipoma surgically removed if you are on the fence. Lipomas that are larger, fast-growing, or invasive into surrounding tissue may be appropriate candidates for surgical removal. Invasive lipomas make surgical removal more challenging, and they are likely to recur. It is important to have an accurate diagnosis so you know that the mass is indeed a lipoma and not a malignant liposarcoma , as their treatments are radically different. Overall, the prognosis after a diagnosis of a cat lipoma is generally good and not a cause for alarm. If you make the choice for a conservative approach—with the approval of your veterinarian—closely monitor the size and growth rate of your cat’s lipoma on a regular basis. Record this information every three months. Documenting any changes in shape, firmness, or skin lesions is also important. Changes can indicate a need to reevaluate the mass with a biopsy. Lipomas in cats do not resolve or go away on their own, though they can shrink with weight loss. Lipomas themselves are benign and do not metastasize to other locations in the body as some dangerous cancers do. This makes them rarely problematic for cats, though it is of importance to realize that lipomas themselves are far less common in cats than dogs. It is dangerous to assume that a mass, even a squishy one that feels like a classic cat lipoma, is indeed a lipoma, as it may be a malignant tumor. Lipomas are growths that are typically found underneath the skin. A cat can have one mass or multiple. Lipomas are somewhat round, and the skin above them is usually normal and healthy.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_mammary_gland_tumor,Cat Mammary Gland Tumors,"Cat mammary gland tumors are formed by an abnormal mass of cells in the mammary (breast) glands. They can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Mammary gland tumors are most common in middle-aged and older female cats, but they can occur in younger female cats, as well as male cats. The most common symptom of a cat mammary gland tumor is a lump or swelling along the cat’s mammary chain, which is the line of breast tissue and nipples along your cat’s belly. The mass may be soft or firm, widespread or clearly defined. You may also see ulceration (sores) as well as discharge from the nipples. In cases of metastasis, where the tumor has spread, you may see other signs of illness, such as difficulty breathing when cancer is also in the lungs. Your vet may also see lymph node swelling. In the later stages of malignant disease, cats lose weight, and a weakened immune system can lead to systemic infections. The reason why a particular cat may get a mammary gland tumor is not entirely understood. Some cats have a genetic predisposition to develop cancer. The risk of cancer also increases with age and exposure to carcinogens, which are cancer-causing agents like pesticides. While we aren’t always able to fully control our cat’s environment and genetics, we can control the largest single factor that increases our cat’s risk of developing mammary tumors. That factor is exposure to the sex hormone estrogen. Early spaying reduces your cat’s exposure to hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. Too many of these hormones can cause the abnormal growth of mammary tumors in cats. When your veterinarian surgically removes your cat’s ovaries and uterus by spaying at an early age, it significantly decreases the risk that your cat will develop mammary cancer. However, spaying is not a treatment for cat mammary gland tumors if cancerous disease has already spread throughout your cat’s body. This makes early spaying—before your cat’s first heat cycle—so important. Your veterinarian will be suspicious of this tumor based on appearance alone, but accurate diagnosis of cat mammary gland tumors requires microscopic examination of tissue. A fine-needle aspirate (collection of fluid from the tumor) and cytology (test for abnormal cells) are noninvasive procedures performed in the vet’s office that yield quick answers. However, these are not reliable diagnosis tools for this type of tumor, so a biopsy (tissue sample) will be required regardless of the cytology results. A pathologist (doctor who studies disease) will interpret the tissue after your veterinarian submits it to a specialized laboratory. This biopsy report typically tells the veterinarian the following information: The type of the tumor – malignant or benign The origin of the tumor – what cells the tumor started from The grade of the tumor – how normal its cells appear, with a higher grade being more cancerous The stage of the tumor – its size and spread The stage of the tumor is also determined by further diagnostic testing , such as chest X -rays, abdominal ultrasound , and occasionally lymph node needle sampling . T hese tests investigate if the primary tumor has spread to other parts of the body. Almost all cat mammary gland tumors are potentially or already malignant when detected. That’s why prompt surgery to remove all affected tissue is critical in preventing the cancer from metastasizing, or spreading, to other parts of the body. On top of that, while one mass may stay benign, another may have already become cancerous, so picking and choosing which mass to remove won’t do any good. The veterinary surgeon may even recommend removing the whole mammary chain, along with the accompanying lymph nodes. After surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be recommended. If a cure is the goal, chemotherapy following complete surgical removal is likely to be the best course, but it is important to realize that this type of tumor is rarely cured once it has become malignant. Recurrence or metastasis (spread) is likely, and survival times are usually not longer than a year. Spaying before the cat’s first heat cycle is the single best way to prevent the possibility of your cat developing mammary cancer. Most cats with malignant (cancerous) mammary gland tumors will experience recurrence of the tumor, despite surgical removal. High-grade (more aggressive) tumors are associated with shorter survival time, which can range from weeks to around one year. Benign and low-grade (less aggressive) tumors can be cured. Yes, it can be, as the tumors can grow large and ulcerate (make sores). Furthermore, metastasis (spread) to the lungs can make breathing difficult. WRITTEN BY Veterinarian Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/cat-nasal-polyps-common-causes-and-how-treat-them,Cat Nasal Polyps: Common Causes and How To Treat Them,"FreshSplash/E+ via Getty Images Nasal polyps are non-cancerous growths that develop in a cat’s ears and nose. They are also called nasopharyngeal polyps because they often grow into the nasopharynx, the space in the back of your cat’s throat. Let’s look at cat nasal polyps and what to do if your cat has them. A polyp is a non-cancerous, fleshy, pink mass that grows from a stalk. Nasal polyps in cats are made up of inflammatory and skin cells. If a polyp grows to a large enough size, you may be able to see it when you look in your cat’s nostril or ear canal, but they are usually difficult to see with the naked eye. Most nasopharyngeal polyps originate in the middle ear and often extend into the Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the area of the throat behind the nose and sinus cavity. As the polyp grows, it extends into the nasopharynx and can cause problems if it puts pressure on the surrounding ear, throat, or nose tissue. Cat nasal polyps are not considered a medical emergency. Nasal polyps are classified according to where they originate: Nasopharyngeal polyp. A polyp that originates in the middle ear and extends through the Eustachian tube into the ear canal or the area behind the soft palate in the back of the throat. Polyp of the nasal turbinate. A polyp that originates in the mucous membranes inside the nose. Nasal polyps can cause issues with a cat’s nose, throat, or ears as they grow. Signs to watch for include: Nasal drainage and congestion Difficulty breathing Sneezing or reverse sneezing Noisy breathing or snoring Difficulty swallowing Head shaking Scratching at the ears Balance issues Head tilt Droopy eyelid on one side Frequent ear infections Nasopharyngeal polyps occur most frequently in young cats . While the exact cause is unknown, it’s believed that cat nasal polyps may be associated with inflammation. This inflammation can come from an underlying ear infection or a respiratory virus like calicivirus or herpesvirus . Cats that come from crowded environments, like catteries or shelters , may be at an increased risk for developing polyps due to increased exposure to viruses. Cats living in a community where many unvaccinated cats share resources are also at an increased risk of polyps. Any breed of cat can get a nasopharyngeal polyp. While they are more common in young cats, cats of all ages can be affected. Because your cat’s Eustachian tubes are located deep inside their head, nasal polyps will be difficult to see when your cat is awake, unless they are very large. If your cat has symptoms of a nasopharyngeal polyp, your vet may recommend sedating them to search for a polyp. While your cat is under anesthesia , your vet can examine the back of their throat. Your vet may use an instrument to sweep the back of your cat’s soft palate and pull the polyp forward. If this isn’t successful, a small, flexible scope may be used to look inside your cat’s throat, ears, and nasal passages. A complete workup, including blood work and X-rays , may be recommended to rule out other common causes of your cat’s symptoms. Occasionally, advanced imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ), may be recommended to better visualize the inner and middle ear. Nasal polyps in cats are treated with surgery. Most of the time, veterinarians can remove polyps by retracting the soft palate, grasping the polyp with a surgical instrument, and gently pulling and twisting. Cat polyps have a long, thin stalk, and this gentle pulling and twisting removes the polyp at its base. Unfortunately, approximately half of polyps that are removed will regrow. Giving oral steroids, such as prednisolone , on a tapering dose after surgery can dramatically reduce the risk of regrowth. Some cats may require a more extensive surgery called a ventral bulla osteotomy. During this procedure, a veterinarian surgically opens the hollow chamber below the ear (the bulla), to remove the polyp at its origin. A surgical laser is sometimes used to remove the tissue at the point of attachment to discourage regrowth. If the polyp is in a location difficult to access, such as deep in the ear or nose, a scope may be needed to help with removal. After surgery your cat may be prescribed antibiotics, such as Clavamox . They may also be prescribed ear drops, like Tresaderm . If more extensive surgery is necessary and your cat is struggling with nausea and motion sickness related to inner ear inflammation, meclizine or Cerenia may be prescribed. While nasal polyps can be treated and are potentially curable in cats, they have a high rate of recurrence. The recovery period after cat nasal polyp removal can last up to two weeks. During that time, your pet may prefer soft food if their throat is tender. If your pet underwent more extensive surgery (such as a ventral bulla osteotomy), they may need to wear a cat recovery collar for 10 to 14 days until their stitches are removed. Minimizing your cat’s exposure to viruses may reduce their risk of chronic inflammation and secondary nasal polyp formation. As the exact cause is not completely understood, polyp formation may be difficult to prevent. Quickly treating any underlying respiratory or ear infections may also reduce risk. Unfortunately, aside from ensuring complete removal of the stalk and giving a tapering course of steroids after removal, there’s no way to prevent future regrowth. Any polyps that regrow will eventually need to be surgically removed again. Young cats affected by nasal polyps can live a normal life span after the polyp is removed. Failing to remove the polyp can lead to chronic infections, worsening symptoms, and a decreased lifespan. Nasal polyps in cats are removed surgically. The cost of surgery varies, based on which technique is performed and what region of the country you live in. Removal with traction and avulsion by your vet is cheaper than a ventral bulla osteotomy performed by a veterinary surgeon. Surgery can cost anywhere from $400 to $4,000. If your cat has chronic sneezing or noisy breathing, a nasopharyngeal polyp may be the cause. Your vet will need to sedate your cat to determine whether they have a polyp.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/cat-pregnancy-and-kittens-complete-guide,"Cat Pregnancy: Signs, Stages, and Care","Prostock-Studio/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images To ensure the birth of healthy kittens , it’s important to understand how to take care of your pregnant cat. While pregnant cats are usually self-sufficient mothers and are known to have kittens through all types of adversity, there are several things a pet parent can do to make the process safer and easier for mother cats. In this article, you’ll learn everything you need to know about cat pregnancy—from diet and care to pregnancy stages and how to build a nest for your cat. The cat gestation period is around two months (averaging 63 –65 days). It can be divided into approximately three trimesters of 20 days each, although the first two trimesters can be difficult to differentiate at home. Detecting pregnancy in cats can be very challenging in the first two trimesters. As a pet parent, you may be wondering—what does a pregnant cat look like? Early signs of cat pregnancy may include nipple changes. This occurs about 16–20 days into the pregnancy, known as “pinking up.” This is where a queen’s nipples become pinker and more prominent. Cats in the first two trimesters are often very friendly and more docile than usual. In the last 20 or so days of pregnancy, a cat’s belly will appear distended, and their nipples/breast tissue will be noticeably swollen. This means that the kittens are continuing to grow, and the cat’s body is starting to prepare for birth. Queens may exhibit increased grooming of their belly and the area under their tail. They will also often search for suitable locations in which to nest or give birth. The pregnancy cycle of cats should last between 63–65 days. A cat’s pregnancy timeline is divided into three trimesters, which last approximately 20 days each. In the first trimester (day one to 21), there are little to no changes seen by most pet parents. Sometimes there is a subtle increase in appetite and the nipples can start to change. In the second trimester (day 21–42), more physical signs start to appear. This includes your cat developing a larger belly and noticeable behavioral changes, such as becoming calmer and cuddlier. In the last trimester (day 42–63), pregnancy changes are more significant. Your cat’s belly will swell and there will be increased nipples and breast changes. Their appetite can become voracious, start licking their belly and vulva often. Your cat will start nesting to prepare a spot for their kittens, often hidden away from any disruptions. Unless a cat has been intentionally bred, determining her due date can be very tricky. A veterinarian may be able to palpate (feel) fetuses about two and a half weeks into the pregnancy. Kitten heartbeats can be seen by ultrasound at three to four weeks into the pregnancy. Kittens can be seen on an X-ray once their skeletons have calcified, at about six weeks. Combining these developmental milestones—along with noting physical changes and observing your pregnant cat’s behaviors—can help you determine how far along your cat is in her pregnancy. However, keep in mind that cats have such short pregnancies. Because of this, some degree of error can occur. A veterinary visit can also help rule out a rare condition known as pseudopregnancy, or false pregnancy . Pseudopregnant cats may exhibit mammary development and even lactation without carrying kittens. Pregnant cats have a few special requirements when it comes to general health care. Making sure they have a quiet, comfortable spot in the home is essential to having a successful pregnancy and birth. This should consist of a lot of cat blankets , cat towels , and/or old sheets lining a cardboard box or a covered cat bed . The bed should be secluded but also in an area where she can be observed from afar to ensure the birth is progressing safely. Pregnant cats need a high-calorie diet to support the growth of healthy kittens. To ensure adequate nutrition, feed a commercial cat diet labeled either specifically for pregnancy and lactation or labeled for kittens (growth). A good food for pregnant cats is Royal Canin® Mother & Baby Cat dry food and wet food . Mother cats should be transitioned to this high-calorie diet by at least the end of the first month of pregnancy and should be fed the same food until weaning, when kittens are no longer nursing . Pregnant queens should receive frequent meals throughout the day. You may notice the amount they eat may decrease as the kittens develop and take up more space in the abdomen, making it important for them to have more opportunities to eat smaller meals. Ideally, cats should be vaccinated prior to pregnancy to prevent illnesses, birth defects, and the risk of pregnancy loss due to infectious diseases. Vaccinated queens can also pass on protection against these diseases to their kittens through nursing via antibodies. If your cat was not vaccinated and becomes pregnant, it’s recommended to wait to vaccinate her until after she gives birth. Live vaccines should never be given to pregnant animals, as there is significant risk to developing fetuses. But killed vaccines, such as most rabies vaccines, can be given if your veterinarian feels it’s appropriate. Parasite prevention does not need to be discontinued in pregnant cats, but it’s important to use products that are safe. For example, Frontline Plus is licensed to safeguard pregnant cats against fleas and ticks. Talk to your veterinarian about products safe for your pregnant cat. Bring a fecal sample to your vet to have it checked for worms . Some intestinal worms are easily passed from mother to kittens during pregnancy and nursing, and worms can make growth very difficult for a kitten. A variety of dewormers can be used in pregnant cats, and your vet can help choose one that will be effective against any parasites found in the fecal sample. Cats are very good at hiding when they are not feeling well, so it is important to monitor your pregnant queen for any subtle signs of illness . If your cat isn’t eating , has diarrhea , or is vomiting , take her to the vet. Vaginal discharge, especially blood, is not normal at any stage of gestation. Take your cat to an urgent veterinary visit if this occurs. As your cat enters her last trimester, provide her with a designated area to nest. Cats prefer a quiet, private area to give birth. If they are not provided with one that you can observe easily, they may choose someplace less convenient for you! The perfect birthing nest allows you to monitor the cat and kittens for issues, while still giving them plenty of space. A cardboard box lined with old pillowcases or towels is ideal. A soft blanket is OK to use as well—however, be careful there are no loose stings or fabrics as that could lead to intestinal obstruction . The location should also be free of drafts, as kittens are sensitive to temperature fluctuation and should not be at risk of getting cold . There may be changes in your pregnant cat’s behavior before birth. Most queens will stop eating the day before labor begins. They will often scratch at their chosen nesting spot and seem slightly agitated. If you are monitoring rectal temperatures, a drop below 100 F indicates that labor is set to start within the day. During this first stage of labor, contractions are beginning but are usually not visibly noticeable. In the second stage of labor, a cat will show active signs of straining. This is the stage where the kitten passes through the pelvis. It usually takes five to 30 minutes for a single kitten to be delivered. Kittens are born inside a sac of fetal membranes and normally come headfirst. The third stage of labor is more passive, as the rest of the fetal membranes and placenta for that kitten are passed. It’s normal for these membranes to appear greenish black. One placenta should be passed for every kitten. The second and third stages often alternate for each kitten, but it’s not unheard of for a second kitten to be born before this stage is completed for the previous kitten. It is normal for queens to eat these membranes. As previously noted, it is important for you to monitor your cat during labor. But unless there are signs of a complicated birth, try not to interact with your cat or interfere. Cats can pause labor in between kittens, and this break can last 24–36 hours. It’s thought that they are more likely to do so if they do not feel safe in their environment. Most cats will deliver all their kittens within six hours, unless there is an interrupted labor as described above. A longer period between kittens with no contractions may be normal; however, prolonged and intense contractions are not. If your cat is having visible contractions for more than 20 minutes without producing a kitten, or if it takes longer than 10 minutes to pass a kitten that is visible in the birth canal, call a veterinarian. Once all kittens have been born, ensure that they are dry and that their noses and mouths are clear. If it can be done without disturbing the new family, clean away any soiled linen in the nesting box to ensure the kittens stay dry and warm. Ideally, the nesting box temperature should stay between 85–90 F for the first week. Typically, healthy kittens need minimal assistance finding their first meal. Monitor your cat to make sure she is allowing normal nursing behaviors. If you are concerned that your cat is rejecting her kittens, call your your vet. Cats can get pregnant as young as four months old, although 5–6 months old is most common. To avoid unwanted pregnancy, female kittens should be kept separate from intact male cats until they’re spayed . Cats are pregnant for 63–65 days. When cats go into labor, usually the kittens are born, and the entire birthing process is over within six hours. A cat will not have many physical changes until later in her pregnancy. At that time, cats will start to have a distinctly enlarged abdomen and their nipples might become darker. Right before they are ready to give birth, pregnant cats’ nipples and breast tissue will also start to enlarge as they begin to produce milk. Yes, cats can get pregnant while nursing. Cats are seasonally polyestrous, meaning they come into heat multiple times a year . Nursing does not affect when they come into heat or their ability to get pregnant.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_motion_sickness,Cats and Motion Sickness,"PetMD Editorial Humans are not the only species to get car sick. Cats also get a queasy stomach when traveling in the car (or even by boat or air). Cats show their uneasiness in various ways. The first signs of motion sickness may be: There are several potential causes of motion sickness in cats. One possible cause of motion sickness can be emotional (behavioral), and linked to a bad travel experience in early life. Many cats feel insecure when taken out of their indoor environment infrequently. Once neurologic, behavioral and other causes of vomiting are ruled out, the diagnosis of motion sickness can be easily made by the cat's veterinarian. The history of the cat's reaction to traveling usually points to the problem. Treatment of this condition may be as simple as making your cat familiar with going for rides in the car. If time and training do not help the situation, various medications are available. Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) have a sedative action to slightly calm the pet during travel, as well as to reduce drooling. Other over-the-counter (OTC) medications that may be useful include meclizine and dimenhydrinate. These drugs don’t cause sedation, but can reduce nausea and vomiting. Ginger is a holistic treatment used for nausea. It can be found in pill form (in health food stores), or even in cookie form. Ginger snaps and pills reportedly calm a nervous stomach when given about 30 minutes to an hour before travel. Consult with your veterinarian before feeding ginger to your cat in any form, to be sure that there are no indications that the ginger would be harmful to your cat, and to make sure that you are giving your cat the appropriate amount. In severe cases, stronger sedative drugs such as acepromazine may be prescribed. A veterinarian should be consulted before any drugs are given (either OTC or prescription) just to be sure the cat is healthy, the dosage is correct, and that the medication won’t harm the cat. Providing a safe, comfortable environment for your cat may lead to a better overall attitude toward travel. Opening the windows in the car slightly may help reduce air pressure inside the vehicle and allow for better ventilation. No food should be given for a few hours prior to getting in the car. Toys may help distract and entertain a high-strung cat. Taking frequent breaks may also help on long trips. Time and acclimation may go a long way to prevent motion sickness. You may need to stock up on certain medications to help calm your cat if and when it gets nervous. Your veterinarian can suggest safe and effective drugs to ensure that travel goes smoothly each and every time. Image via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/cat-scratch-fever-cats-what-it-and-how-it-treated,Cat Scratch Fever in Cats: What Is It and How Is It Treated?,"Nungning20/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Cat scratch fever is a disease in cats caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae , which is spread through flea bites and cat scratches . Affected cats experience symptoms like swollen lymph nodes , lethargy , and a reduced appetite . It can affect cats of any age, but it is most common in kittens, adult community cats, and those with weakened immune systems. When fleas bite infected cats, they contract the bacterium and then shed it in their droppings, which are found on the cat’s fur . When cats scratch themselves, they can get these droppings underneath their claws and spread the infection to another cat through a scratch. Most cats with cat scratch fever do not have symptoms. However, if symptoms do develop, the cat should be brought to a veterinarian promptly for appropriate treatment. This is especially important since this disease is zoonotic, meaning it can be spread from cats to their human pet parents . While most cats with cat scratch fever do not actually develop any symptoms, some cats—such as young kittens and cats with weak immune systems—may experience the following: Lethargy Decreased appetite Swollen lymph nodes Fever Vomiting Reddened eyes Blister or bump on skin (where scratch occurred) Cat scratch fever can be caused by any of the following: Flea bites Scratches or bites from infected cats Blood transfusions Cats that are not up to date on flea and tick preventatives are at the highest risk of contracting this disease. Cats with weak immune systems, such as kittens and those with chronic diseases like FeLV , may also be more likely to become infected. A veterinarian will start with a physical exam to check your cat’s overall health and identify abnormalities. During this time, pet parents can discuss their cats’ concerning symptoms, whether they’re current on flea and tick preventatives, and if their cats have had any recent exposure to other cats. If the veterinarian suspects cat scratch fever, testing can be done to support a diagnosis, which may include: Blood work: A small sample of the cat’s blood is collected to check for signs of infection, such as increased white blood cells or liver enzymes. Blood can also be used for more advanced testing, such as PCR or ELISA, to see if antibodies against B. henselae are present. Bacterial culture: If blood work shows signs of infection, a blood sample can be sent to a special laboratory to identify which type of bacterium may be the culprit. Lymph node aspirate: The veterinarian uses a small needle to poke and gently collect a sample from a cat’s swollen lymph node. The sample can be placed onto a glass slide and viewed under a microscope to identify if any cells that indicate infection are present. Most cats do not require treatment. Cats with healthy immune systems are generally able to fight the infection themselves. However, in cats with weakened immune systems or severe symptoms, treatment may be necessary. Treatment consists of antibiotics for four to six weeks. Common antibiotics used include doxycycline and enrofloxacin . Although antibiotic treatment generally eliminates this bacterium, cats can become re-infected if fleas are not properly addressed as well. Cats should be treated with a topical or oral flea preventative such as Bravecto ® or Revolution ® to eliminate fleas. Because many cats do not have any symptoms, they generally recover well on their own with time. Cats who develop symptoms typically start feeling better just a few days after initiating antibiotic treatment. However, it can take one to two months for all symptoms, especially swollen lymph nodes, to fully resolve. Pet parents should always give antibiotics exactly as prescribed by their veterinarians for best treatment outcomes. During recovery and in the initial post-treatment period, it is important to prevent re-infection for cats. Pet parents should ensure they have administered flea preventative and that they do not allow any close contact with currently infected cats. Cat scratch disease is a preventable condition. To keep their cats healthy, important steps pet parents should take include: Keeping cats on year-round flea prevention Avoiding contact with infected cats Preventing cats from biting and scratching one another To determine if your cat has cat scratch fever, bring him to a veterinarian for examination. The veterinarian will likely draw some blood for testing to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. Home remedies for cat scratch fever are not recommended. If your cat is showing troublesome symptoms, he should be brought to a veterinarian for appropriate treatment.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/cat-skin-allergies-types-symptoms-and-how-vets-treat-them,"Cat Skin Allergies: Types, Symptoms, and How Vets Treat Them","Wirestock/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images An allergy happens when the immune system overreacts to an outside substance or protein (antigen), which is called a hypersensitivity reaction. Over time, further exposure to an allergen leads to an inflammatory (swelling) reaction that damages the skin barrier and leads to symptoms of itching, followed by redness, scaling, crusting, and hair loss . Cat skin allergies—which can affect any age, breed, or sex of cat—are generally categorized in four groups: Fleas : Flea saliva antigen gets into the cat’s immune system when a flea bites a cat. Flea allergy is the most common type of cat skin allergy and can happen year-round. It’s often diagnosed with direct evidence of fleas on the cat and caused by not using the right or consistent flea control . Food : A food allergy is an uncommon type of cat skin allergy usually caused by an overreaction of the immune system to food proteins, commonly either chicken or beef . Symptoms can happen year-round and at any age. Oddly, symptoms don’t always start after a recent change in diet . Environmental : Also known as atopic dermatitis, environmental allergies are often diagnosed once other types of allergies have been ruled out. Symptoms, which usually are seasonal, may appear around the face, groin, feet, armpits, and ears. They are caused by molds, pollens, dander, grasses, mites , and dust. Contact: This type of allergy is also uncommon because of a cat’s fur layer, and it primarily affects sparsely haired areas like the belly and armpits. These allergies are reactions to detergents, dyes, shampoos, insecticides, and plants. These four types of allergies can share similar symptoms, but some have unique characteristics that can help the veterinarian figure out and treat the underlying cause. The most common symptoms of cat skin allergies are itching , scratching, and excessive grooming . Secondary skin infections are common, so other symptoms may be seen, such as: Hair loss, often by the neck, base of ears, base of tail, or groin; symmetrical along the back Crusts, scabs, or irritated skin Ear infections (red, stinky, painful ears along with head shaking or scratching) Ulcers and open sores Fleas and/or flea dirt Cat skin allergies aren’t entirely understood, but there seems to be a genetic factor that makes the skin barrier become more sensitive to allergens. The immune system overreacts, resulting in an allergy and symptoms. Repetitive exposure worsens the response. Not all scratching is due to allergies. After a thorough physical examination , your veterinarian may recommend some skin tests, such as: Skin impression: Skin and hair are taken to look for evidence of bacterial and fungal (yeast) infection. This is done by either imprinting the skin lesion on a slide, or using tape to take skin, hair, cells and debris—which will be stained and looked at under a microscope. Skin scraping: Skin and hair are taken with a “scraping” technique to look for skin mites. DTM or fungal culture/PCR: Hair is taken to look for ringworm infection . Blood work may also be done to make sure your cat is otherwise healthy and that the right medications can be prescribed. If a contact allergy is suspected, your veterinarian may simply recommend simply staying away from the suspected allergen, or they may recommend a patch test, which involves keeping the substance in close contact with the skin for about two days and then checking for signs of infection, inflammation, pimples, or crusts. If a food allergy is suspected, your veterinarian may recommend doing a food trial for 12 weeks with a prescription diet only. No treats or table scraps can be given during this time. At the end of the 12 weeks, the previous food is intentionally given to see if there is a return of symptoms, which would signal a food allergy. If an environmental allergy is suspected and other types of allergies have been ruled out, then your veterinarian may recommend intradermal skin or serum testing. In this test, a veterinary dermatologist injects antigens into a cat’s skin, measured against a control, and seeks to determine which substance is causing a reaction. Treating cat skin allergies can be frustrating because there is no quick cure. Cats will need to be treated for life and can have repeated flare-ups and secondary skin infections. Collaborating with your veterinarian is important, as your cat may need frequent checkups and routine skin testing. Treatment depends on the underlying allergy type. Food allergies mean your cat needs a lifelong prescription diet and can’t be given certain foods. Flea allergies need consistent flea control and environmental management. Contact and environmental allergies mean your cat needs to avoid the allergens as often as possible. Steroids such as prednisolone and Depo-Medrol® (injectable) and immunomodulators such as Atopica ™ may be prescribed to not only control the itch, but also to lower the immune system’s response to the allergen. Antihistamines like diphenhydramine or chlorpheniramine are also commonly used to help control the itching, but some cats may get relief and others may not benefit at all. Allergen specific immunotherapy (ASIT), commonly referred to as allergy shots, is the most effective long-term therapy for cats with environmental allergies. While ASIT can be time-consuming and costly (though much medical care is also needed when treating recurrent infections), decreasing the immune system’s response to the allergen over time can substantially improve your cat’s quality of life. The results of the intradermal skin testing are used to create a vaccine, which is given in increasing doses over time and decreases the cat’s overall sensitivity. Fatty acid supplements such as omega-3/fish oils are great products that strengthen the skin barrier, which leads to less skin irritation, redness, and swelling. As a result, itching is decreased. Bacterial and yeast infections, often occurring secondary to the allergy, can cause an increase in your cat’s level of itching. Antibiotics and antifungals are usually needed. Long-term treatment with topicals such as medicated shampoos or conditioners is often needed and can often decrease the need for repeated antibiotic usage. It’s unlikely that cats can ever “outgrow” their allergies. Symptoms often reoccur. However, with the right diagnosis and therapy, your cat’s symptoms often improve within a few days. However, it can take several weeks to have all symptoms go away. Your cat may need lifelong medication and/or diet, and it’s important to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for rechecks and follow-up care and testing. Staying away from the allergen, when possible, is best, which may mean removing carpet, uprooting plants and weeds, using HEPA filters , and following a strict flea control regimen . Recovery cones , T-shirts, or other barrier methods (such as this recovery suit ) may be useful as well as more frequent bathing or leave-on shampoos and conditioners. Cat skin allergies are not entirely preventable. Keeping your cat from licking and scratching will prevent future infections. It’s also important to watch the pollen counts and have your cat examined at the first sign of itching. Apps like Allergy Plus by Pollen.com have been helpful for many pet parents. Feline dermatitis, sometimes referred to as miliary dermatitis, is seen as crusts, scabs, and hair loss, along with intense itching, usually around the neck or rear. There are no natural remedies to cure cats of skin allergies; however, since cats with allergies often have a skin barrier problem, adding fish oils to the diet could help lessen itching and scaling. Having less of the specific allergen, either through avoidance or through cool oatmeal baths, could be helpful. Because cats are sensitive to many substances, talk to your veterinarian for the best treatment possible.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/c_ct_tooth_root_abscess,Cat Tooth Abscess,"A cat tooth abscess is an inflammatory reaction to infection from a dead tooth. This infection around the root of the tooth leads to destruction of the bone. The painful bony infection and inflammation can spread to the soft tissues of the face and create a swelling of the cheek or chin. The swelling may break open, and blood-tinged liquid or pus may drain out. Here are some definitions that can help you understand what your vet has to say about cat tooth abscess: Abscess : an area of inflamed and infected tissue, usually due to a bacterial infection Pulp : the collection of nerves, blood vessels, and soft tissue that live inside a tooth Tooth root apex : the end of a tooth root that connects the pulp’s nerves and blood vessels to the rest of the body Canine tooth : the larger, sharper tooth in the front of the mouth that is used for grabbing and biting. Though the name may make you think of dogs, cats have four canine teeth. Many cats with fractured teeth have no obvious symptoms and fractured teeth are found in a routine veterinary exam. The following symptoms may occur for a cat with a tooth abscess: Facial swelling Dropping of food while eating Difficulty picking up food Preferring soft food over kibble The most common cause of a tooth abscess is a fractured tooth. When a tooth breaks and the pulp is exposed, it becomes inflamed and dies due to an invasion of bacteria from the mouth. While it is true that not all fractured teeth lead to abscesses, they all require treatment from your vet. Teeth have an enamel covering on the outside that acts as a hard shield to protect the pulp. Cat enamel is very thin, only 0.1-0.3mm thick—much thinner than humans. Any fracture of a tooth is likely to cause exposure of the tooth pulp. Canine teeth are the most commonly fractured in cats. Your vet may suspect a cat tooth abscess if there is a fractured tooth, facial swelling, or a draining sore on the gumline. To make the diagnosis, the vet will put your cat under anesthesia to perform a tooth-by-tooth exam of the whole mouth and take X-rays of each tooth above and below the gumline. Technically, sampling the tissue around the root is the only way to confirm a tooth abscess. But dental X-rays combined with the tooth exam allow your veterinarian to evaluate the mouth and make a diagnosis.4 In the end, all fractured teeth are dead and require treatment by your vet to prevent an abscess from forming and your cat from being in pain. Treatment for a cat tooth abscess with depend on the diagnosis. The most common treatment for this condition will be tooth extraction. Tooth extraction will most likely include: Pain medications to relieve your cat’s pain while waiting for tooth extraction Antibiotics to treat the infection Extraction with anesthesia and a local nerve block to numb the area, with stitches to hold the site together while the gum heals After anesthesia for extraction of the infected tooth, your cat will be on soft, canned food for about 14 days. This is to prevent hard food from disrupting the stitches during the healing period. You will need to keep toys, hard treats, and other chew objects away from your cat during this time to prevent healing complications. The best way to prevent future abscesses is to have your cat’s mouth evaluated under anesthesia with a tooth-by tooth-oral exam and full mouth dental X-rays every year or as directed by your vet.5 Since cats don’t generally let us know when their mouth hurts, this allows your veterinarian to work with you to make sure your cat isn’t hiding any potentially painful areas. Young cats with fractured canine teeth can be treated with root canal therapy to maintain the structure and use of the tooth. Other diseases that can affect cats and cause oral pain include Tooth resorption Gingivitis Periodontal disease These are all more common in older cats and are also diagnosed with dental X-rays and an oral exam under anesthesia. If your cat has a tooth abscess, you may notice a swelling suddenly developing on her cheeks or chin. These swellings can drain blood-tinged or pus-like fluids. Unfortunately, a cat tooth abscess cannot heal until the dead tooth is removed by your vet. A tooth abscess requires veterinary care and cannot be treated at home. Your vet may prescribe antibiotics and pain medication to keep your cat comfortable before the tooth is pulled, but that procedure will need to be done in the vet’s office under anesthesia. 1.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/ears/cauliflower-ear-cats,Cauliflower Ear in Cats,"Cauliflower ear in cats is a condition that affects the ear flap, or pinna. It is a wrinkled-looking scarring of the ear flap cartilage that occurs after a hematoma, which is a blood-filled swelling caused by a broken blood vessel. Since ear infections are a primary cause of hematomas, stray cats and cats that regularly spend time outdoors may be more at risk for ear hematomas and cauliflower ear. If you suspect a hematoma or cauliflower ear in your cat, watch for the following signs: Soft swelling of the ear flap that may feel like a water balloon Narrowed ear canal opening due to swelling of the ear flap Wrinkled ear flap Scratching of the ears with or without odor or discharge The causes of cauliflower ear in cats depend on the underlying issue, but they most commonly occur due to ear infections. Other causes may include: Infection, especially with ear mites Wounds to the ear caused by blunt trauma or fight wounds Persistent, intense scratching of ears by the cat Allergies that cause itchy ears Bleeding or clotting disorder Foreign body in the ear canal, causing increased scratching of the ear Diagnosis of cauliflower ear is made by looking at the ear during a physical exam. If an infection is present, any ear discharge will be examined or cultured to determine the cause. An example of the discharge may be examined by placing it in immersion oil on a slide and looking microscopically to check for the presence of ear mites. The discharge may be cultured if a bacterial infection is suspected. This is done by collecting a sample of the discharge with a special swab and sending it to a lab for testing or running a culture in the veterinary clinic. Finding the exact cause of infection ensures that the right medication is used for treatment. Blood tests that check clotting function and platelets may be done to see if there is a bleeding disorder. If allergies are suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a hypoallergenic diet or allergy testing. Treatment of cauliflower ear includes relieving the swelling caused by the hematoma by repeated draining or by doing surgery. Surgical options include making a small incision at each end of the swelling and placing a drain tube or cutting and opening the skin over the entire hematoma to allow it to drain. If the hematoma is very small or the cat is not a good surgical candidate because of anesthesia concerns, repeated draining of the hematoma is a more likely treatment. Surgery would be preferred if there is concern that the ear canal could be closed off by scarring of the ear flap. While a hematoma can resolve on its own if left untreated, the cat will be in pain as the ear heals, and the scarring and the resultant cauliflower-shaped ear may obstruct the ear canal. After the scarring has developed, it cannot be reversed. It is also very important to treat any underlying infection or other condition that led to the hematoma in the first place. This may include oral or topical antibiotics, medications to get rid of ear mites, and pain medication. It is important to prevent ear infections in your cat to decrease the chance of a hematoma forming. Preventing access to the outdoors will help avoid ear mites. There are also topical products to help prevent ear mites, such as Revolution , Revolution Plus , and Seresto . If you notice any redness, discharge, or itchiness in your cat’s ears, contact your veterinarian so they can exam your cat. Permanent scarring of the ear flap often results from ear hematomas, but the damage can be minimized with prompt treatment. Not treating an ear hematoma can result in significant discomfort for your cat and could potentially result in scarring that closes off the ear canal and seals in any infection that may be present. If you own or adopt a cat that has permanent scarring due to a previous ear hematoma, make sure to monitor them for any signs of an ear infection that may need treatment. Signs of an ear infection can include increased scratching of the ears or shaking the head, or redness, odor, or discharge coming from the ears. Make sure to get your cat examined by your veterinarian if you note any of these signs. Otherwise, cats with the scarring of cauliflower ear usually do not have any long-term health issues related to the condition. The swelling and inflammation associated with cauliflower ear can be quite painful. In addition, the underlying cause may also create discomfort and should be treated to minimize pain.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_cerebellar_hypoplasia,Cerebellar Hypoplasia in Cats,"Cerebellar hypoplasia is a condition where a kitten’s brain does not finish growing and remains in an immature state due to a viral infection in the mother cat. The infection causes a pause in the unborn kitten’s brain development, specifically to the area called the cerebellum, which is responsible for coordinated movement and balance. The severity of symptoms highly depends on how developed the kitten is at the time the mother is infected. It is not a contagious disease, so if your cat is exposed to another cat with cerebellar hypoplasia, your cat is not at risk for developing any symptoms. The condition does not worsen over time to those cats that are born with cerebellar hypoplasia. Kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia experience problems with movement and mobility. If you think your kitten may have this condition, look for neurological problems like the following: · Wobbling or swaying when walking · Uncoordinated movements · Abnormal gait (walking, trotting) · Tremors · Overstepping or “goose-walking” · Difficulty going from a sitting position to standing, or vice versa The brain damage is permanent but does not get worse with age. The virus that causes cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens is called feline panleukopenia virus . If a mother cat with no history of vaccination is exposed to the virus during pregnancy and becomes infected, she will pass it to her unborn kittens, who are then at risk for developing cerebellar hypoplasia. The diagnosis of cerebellar hypoplasia in cats is typically based on clinical signs. Your veterinarian will assess a kitten’s well-being by performing a physical exam and studying the movements when the kitten tries to walk or change position. Your vet may also rule out other diseases by running certain tests, such as blood work. Although there is no specific test to confirm cerebellar hypoplasia in cats, sometimes a brain scan or MRI can show a small cerebellum. There is no treatment for cats diagnosed with this condition because it is due to the brain failing to develop properly Most kittens with cerebellar hypoplasia will live a normal lifespan and can overcome any limitations the virus may have caused to brain development. A cat with cerebellar hypoplasia can live a normal life with a normal lifespan. Most overcome their limitations and find their own way to navigate the world. To prevent cerebellar hypoplasia in any future kittens, it is very important to make sure that your female cat is always up to date on vaccines your vet recommends. The panleukopenia virus is commonly covered by core feline vaccines and can be given to cats before breeding. It is important to bring cats to the vet prior to breeding to make sure they are protected against this avoidable disease. Since the mother is infected with the panleukopenia virus while pregnant, kittens within a litter are all at risk of developing symptoms. However, in some cases, only one kitten in a litter has cerebellar hypoplasia. Kittens infected in utero with cerebellar hypoplasia tend to have a normal lifespan. They grow up to navigate around their limitations.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_chediak-higashi_syndrome,Chediak-Higashi Syndrome in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects Persian cats with a dilute smoke-blue coat color and yellow-green irises (though it can also affect some white tiger Persians and arctic foxes), which causes the cats to bleed excessively immediately after an injury or minor surgery. Cats with this syndrome may also have an extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia). Despite the affects brought on by Chediak-Higashi syndrome, affected cats usually have a normal lifespan. A cat with Chediak-Higashi syndrome will bleed for an abnormally long period, often due to minor surgery or injuries. The cat's eyes will reflect a red eyeshine when exposed to light; excessive blinking and eye watering may also occur. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam and take a background medical history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Other diseases will need to be ruled out, but if your cat fits the genetic type, your veterinarian will do a smear test for Chediak-Higashi syndrome using a sample of the blood that was taken. Your veterinarian will give your cat vitamin C to improve blood cell and platelet function and help decrease bleeding time. If your cat is having trouble with prolonged bleeding, a transfusion of platelet-rich plasma (from healthy cat blood) will be given to your cat to temporarily normalize the bleeding time. You will need to remain aware of your cat's condition and maintain an environment that prevents accidents as much as possible so that your cat does not suffer an injury that would cause bleeding. Any scrapes or cuts could become a life-threatening issue, so it is best to try to avoid them. You will also need to keep this in mind when seeking veterinary care for your cat, making sure that the caregiver knows of your cat's disease so that precautions can be taken to prevent prolonged bleeding after having blood drawn. Because this is a genetically acquired condition, it is strongly advised that cats that have been diagnosed with Chediak-Higashi syndrome be neutered or spayed immediately to prevent it from being passed on to offspring.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_hyposthenuria,Chemical Imbalance of Urine in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hyposthenuria is a clinical condition in which the urine is chemically imbalanced. This may be due to trauma, abnormal hormone release, or excessive tension in the kidney. The normal concentration and regulation of urine normally depends on an elaborate interaction between antidiuretic hormone (ADH), the protein receptor for ADH on the renal tubule (the tube that plays a role in the filtering, reabsorption, and secretion of solutes in the bloodstream), and excessive tension of the tissue within the kidney. Abnormalities may also occur due to interference with the synthesis, release, or actions of ADH, damage to the renal tubule, and altered tension (tonicity) of the tissue within the kidney (medullary interstitium). Symptoms will depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. Some of the more common ones include: Any disorder or drug that interferes with the release or action of ADH, damages the renal tubule, causes medullary washout, or causes a primary thirst disorder. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, with emphasis on determining the urine specific gravity. The latter test reveals the functional capability of the kidney in its capacity to eliminate waste molecules without eliminating excess nutrients or water. These tests may confirm a urinary condition, with a low urine specific gravity of 1.000 to 1.006 g/ml, and excessive amounts of alkaline phosphates (ALP) in the blood serum, which would suggest hypoadrenocorticism or primary liver disease. High cholesterol is another common finding in cats with hyperadrenocorticism. In cats suffering from pyometra (a disease of the uterus) or pyelonephritis (urinary tract infection), leukocytosis, a type of white blood cell, will be raised and will be present in the urine sample, along with abnormal amounts of protein in the urine, a condition called proteinuria. Proteinuria is common in patients with pyelonephritis, pyometra, and hyperadrenocorticism. If an underlying condition of pyelonephritis is present, the urinalysis will also show inflammatory sediment or bacteria in the urine (bacteriuria). Other laboratory tests your doctor may want to conduct are adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level checks in order to determine the cause of the hyperadrenocorticism, if found. That is, your veterinarian will want to distinguish a pituitary dependent versus an adrenal tumor. Visual imaging, using X-ray, may also be included to determine if the kidneys or surrounding urinary tract organs are damaged in any way. An intravenous pyelogram is the most accurate diagnostic technique for a visual examination of the kidneys, ureter, and urinary bladder. This is a minimally invasive procedure which uses an injection of contrasting material into the bloodstream, where it then collects in the kidneys and urinary tract and illuminates them on the X-ray. An ultrasonography can be used to assess adrenal size, kidney and liver size and architecture, and uterine size (abnormal findings in the size of one or more of these organs may confirm an infection or reaction to infection). In addition, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan can be used to assess a pituitary or hypothalamic (which links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland) mass, which can be an associated cause of central diabetes insipidus or hyperadrenocorticism. Treatment for the hyposthenuria will depend on the underlying disorder. Even if your cat is urinating excessively, or is having trouble making it to the litter box in time, do not restrict your cat's water intake unless it is appropriate to the definitive diagnosis and has been recommended by your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits to monitor your cat's urine specific gravity, hydration status, kidney function, and electrolyte balance. Dehydration is a possible complication with hyposthenuria, and can quickly become a life threatening condition, so care must be taken to ensure that your cat is properly hydrated at all times.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_prolapsed_gland,Cherry Eye in Cats,"Cats have three eyelids and “cherry eye” is a term used to describe a prolapse (slipping) of the third eyelid. The two main eyelids are responsible for holding the eye in the socket and covering the cornea. The third eyelid, also known as the nictitating membrane, sits in the corner of the eye and covers the eye diagonally. This third eyelid is responsible for producing 30 percent of the tear film for the eye. The other part of the tear film is produced by the outer eyelids and the conjunctiva (the membrane on the inside of the eyelids). The third eyelid is held in place by fibers, and for some cats, if these fibers are weak, the tear gland will protrude (stick out). This is often referred to as a cherry eye. Cherry eyes can occur in any breed of cat but are more common in Persian and Burmese cats. As a pet parent, you may notice a thin film—or a small pink swelling—in the corner of your cat’s eye. In some situations, you may also notice some clear or mucus-like discharge from the eye. If this is causing your cat discomfort, it will rub the affected eye. The protrusion of the third eyelid in cats typically occurs from a weakness in the fibers that attach the third eyelid to the inside of the globe. There are other conditions including the cartilage of the eyelid rolling out, or third eyelid mass that could look similar in appearance to cherry eye. It’s important to consult with your veterinarian to confirm the specific condition. To diagnose this condition, your veterinarian will do a thorough ocular (eye) examination. They will confirm if the structure that is enlarged is the third eyelid and rule out other issues such as an ocular mass, swelling or protrusion of the conjunctiva. Common ocular tests performed include : Tonometry : This is a diagnostic test that involves checking the pressure of the eye. Your veterinarian will usually apply an eye drop to numb the surface of the eye and then a small pen is gently tapped against the surface to measure the pressure inside the eye. Schirmer’s test : This is a test that helps determine if your cat has developed dry eye secondary to the cherry eye. The test involves your veterinarian placing a small test strip of paper in the eye and measuring the tear production in each eye over the course of a minute. The treatment for cats with cherry eye is surgical correction. If a diagnosis of cherry eye is made and is found to be secondary to weakened attachment fibers, the sooner it is corrected surgically, the better chance the gland has to maintain its normal function. The longer the cherry eye is present, the more concerned your vet will be about inflammation and further trauma your cat can cause to the gland. One of the surgical techniques involves creating a pocket in the conjunctival tissues to place the tear gland inside and sew the pocket closed to keep the third eyelid in place. If dry eye is diagnosed , secondary to the presence of cherry eye, your veterinarian may prescribe eye medications to help with this or to manage any conjunctivitis (pink eye) that may also be present. Recovery time following surgery is approximately one week. There may be some mild swelling following surgery, but after a week it should disappear. The most common complication is that the third eyelid gland may become prolapsed again. It is important to let your veterinarian know right away in case a second procedure is required, or if a referral to a veterinary eye specialist is needed. Cherry eye usually does not go away if it is due to weakened attachment fibers. Once your vet has ruled out other medical conditions contributing to protrusion of a third eyelid, the solution is a surgical correction. The cost of any surgery is always variable based upon the clinic you take your cat to, but the average cost of cherry eye repair for one eye can be from $300-$500. Always consult with your veterinarian for appropriate treatment estimates. Cherry eye in cats is not contagious. If the cherry eye is left untreated there is the potential for issues with tear production in the affected eye, and a condition called KCS (dry eye) may develop. If this condition occurs, then your cat will need eye products to help lubricate the eye and medications to try to stimulate the tear gland. Paul Pion, D. V.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/chiggers-on-cats,Chiggers on Cats,"Chiggers are mites belonging to the Trombiculidae family. The larval form of this mite can affect your cat’s skin and cause itching, redness, and sores. They are also known as harvest mites, red bugs, red mites, or berry bugs. Most infestations in the United States occur in the southeast and south-central regions, mainly in the summer and fall. Only the larvae (immature animals) are parasitic; the adults live in the soil and leaf litter. Chiggers will feed on a pet for less than a week before falling off. Cats can get chiggers through contact with mites which can be present in low-lying vegetation, such as grass, weeds, low bushes and plants, and leaf litter. The larvae crawl onto the cat, pierce the skin, inject enzymes, and suck up the digested contents. The larvae fall off the skin 3-5 days later, beginning the next stage of development in the environment. The most common symptom of chiggers in cats is itching. This may be accompanied by: Skin redness Skin lesions Crusty skin Hair loss Some cats infested with chiggers may have no symptoms. When your vet closely examines your cat’s fur, chiggers will show up as small orange specks. These are the mites or clumps of mites. Microscopic examination of these specks from skin scrapings or adhesive tape will provide a definitive diagnosis. Chiggers prefer to infest the face and base of the ears, but they can appear on any part of your cat’s body. There is no specifically approved treatment for chiggers. However, most flea and tick products should be effective. Reinfestation may occur if cats have access to infested areas. Chigger infestations should resolve within a few weeks after appropriate treatment. Routine application of flea/tick products should prevent reinfestation. Once chiggers have attached to a cat, they cannot be spread to people. Featured Image: iStock.com/chendongshan WRITTEN BY Veterinarian Dr. Leigh Burkett was born and raised in Northeast Tennessee.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_chorioretinitis,Chorioretinitis in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Chorioretinitis is a medical condition which affects the eyes of cats. The term refers to inflammation of the choroid and retina, a layered membrane that lines the inner eyeball and which contains the light-sensitive rods, cones, and cells that convert images into signals and send messages to the brain to allow for vision. The choroid is located immediately under the retina and is part of the middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels. The choroid is also called the posterior uvea, which is the entire middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels. Spreading inflammation may result in separation of the back part of the eye (retina) from the underlying, vascular part of the eyeball (choroid); a condition known as retinal detachment. Chorioretinitis may be a sign of a generalized (systemic) disease. Therefore, appropriate diagnostic testing is important. Secondary glaucoma, in which the pressure within the eye is increased secondary to inflammation in the eye, can also be a complication related to inflammation, and will also require treatment. Chorioretinitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Chorioretinitis is not usually painful except when the front part of the eye, including the iris, is affected. Some of the symptoms that may point to chorioretinitis include vitreous abnormalities, which can display as tearing, bleeding, or will show evidence of the vitreous becoming liquefied (the vitreous is the clear, gel-like material that fills the back part of the eyeball between the lens and the retina). A condition sometimes seen in cats is invasion of the eye by fly larvae. Tracts from migrating larvae may be seen when the eye is examined with an ophthalmoscope. Changes in the appearance of the retina when examined with an ophthalmoscope may include change in color, darkened or lighter areas, scars, and changes in the contour/surface of the retina. A close examination may show few, or small, lesions. As you can see in the list below, the conditions that can lead to chorioretinitis are varied. Your veterinarian will need to consider biological, chemical, and genetic causes, just to name a few. There is also the possibility that a cause for the condition will not be found, in which case it will be classified as idiopathic (of unknown origin) in nature. Your veterinarian will use diagnostic tools that are both invasive and non-invasive in order to make a correct diagnosis of chorioretinitis. The non-invasive methods will include measuring your pet's blood pressure; screening a large area of the retina with indirect ophthalmoscopy (an instrument used for viewing the interior structure of the eye by use of a light reflecting mirror), or using direct ophthalmoscopy for closer examination of the affected areas of the eye. If results are not conclusive at that point, the need for invasive procedures will become a factor in pinpointing the cause for the chorioretinitis. Your veterinarian may be able to make a diagnosis by examining a fluid specimen from the eye, which will be a fairly simple procedure, or there may be a need for a deeper examination, in which case your doctor will want to take a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (also called spinal fluid, the liquid that bathes the brain and spine) to look for infection, or for an indication of central nervous system disease or optic neuritis. Cerebrospinal fluid is removed through a procedure called a spinal tap, where a needle is inserted into the vertebrae of the spine and the fluid is allowed to collect into a vial. The sample is then sent to a lab for testing. It is a fairly quick procedure, but your pet would have to be sedated and might be affected for the rest of the day afterward. Treatment will be dependent on the physical condition of the cat, but is usually outpatient. The possible long-term complications of chorioretinitis include permanent blindness, cataracts, glaucoma, and chronic eye pain. In the worst cases, death can occur secondary to a systemic disease. The expected course and prognosis for chorioretinitis is guarded to good for retaining vision, depending on the amount of retina affected and on the underlying cause. Visual deficits or blindness may be a permanent complication if large areas of the retina were destroyed. Focal and multifocal diseases do not markedly impair vision permanently, but do leave scars on the animal's eyes. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/chronic-diarrhea-cats,Chronic Diarrhea in Cats,"iStock/Nils Jacobi “My cat has runny poop all the time.” If this is a concern of yours, you’re in the right place. You’ll want to know what cat chronic diarrhea is, what causes it, what diagnostics to expect, and treatment options. In this article, you’ll learn everything a pet parent needs to know about chronic diarrhea in cats. The color, consistency, and frequency of your cat's bowel movements are indicators of their digestive health and overall well-being . Cat stool should appear brown and well formed, easily scooped but not too firm. When the food your cat eats doesn’t spend enough time in the intestines, the absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water is diminished and it results in stool that is soft, mushy, liquid, or watery. This softer stool is called diarrhea . Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea that reoccurs frequently over time. It’s stool that is consistently softer than normal and continues intermittently or continuously for three weeks or longer. Chronic diarrhea affects cats of all breeds and ages and can have many causes. Kittens , senior cats, and cats that are immunocompromised are most susceptible to serious complications of chronic diarrhea and should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Small intestinal (small bowel) diarrhea and large intestinal (large bowel) diarrhea are two terms used to indicate what portion of the intestines is affected. In small bowel diarrhea, there is a larger volume of stool than normal. If blood is present in the stool, it will look black or tarry. In large bowel diarrhea, frequency is increased and there may be a smaller volume per bowel movement. If blood is present in the stool, it will look bright red. Cats with this type of diarrhea may strain to defecate. Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Symptoms of chronic diarrhea in cats depend on the cause. If your cat has diarrhea (this may be soft-to-watery in consistency) that lasts longer than 24-48 hours, or if they are showing any of the following symptoms, they should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Abnormal stool color (dark, tarry stool) Fresh blood in the stool Straining to defecate Increased frequency of defecation Weight loss Increased or decreased appetite Decreased energy level ( lethargy ) Vomiting Dehydration Increased flatulence Visible parasites in the stool Common causes of chronic diarrhea in cats are: Disease that affects the intestines or gastrointestinal system Disease that affects another part of the body, and diarrhea occurs as a result Let's look a little deeper at these common causes. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Intestinal parasites ( Tritrichomonas foetus , giardia , worms , cryptosporidium , coccidia ) Bacterial infections ( E. coli , salmonella , Clostridium ) Viral infections ( feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus ) Food allergies Vitamin deficiencies Partial obstructions (foreign material, intussusceptions, or masses) Abnormal digestion of food ( protein losing enteropathy or pancreatic insufficiency ) Triaditis Gastrointestinal lymphoma Hyperthyroidism Kidney disease Liver disease Diabetes Cancer ( lymphoma , mast cell tumors , adenocarcinoma ) Pancreatitis Keeping a detailed history of your pet’s bathroom habits can be very helpful in diagnosing chronic diarrhea in cats. This should include the length, appearance, and frequency of the diarrhea, and anything that seems to improve or worsen it. The following tests may be used to diagnose your cat’s diarrhea: Blood work Thyroid test Fecal test Urinalysis Depending on your cat’s symptoms and results of previous testing, your veterinarian may conduct or refer your pet for additional tests, such as X-rays Ultrasound Endoscopy/colonoscopy Biopsies (collected via colonoscopy or surgically) Treatment of chronic diarrhea in cats depends on its cause. Your vet will identify any underlying causes and will recommend specific treatments for nonintestinal-related diseases such as hyperthyroidism or diabetes, as well as those that are intestinal-related. Your cat may need digestive support medications or supplements such as probiotics or vitamin B12. Depending on your cat’s condition, your vet may recommend a diet trial. If your veterinarian suspects a food allergy, they’ll recommend a diet with novel or hydrolyzed proteins. A novel protein diet is a diet containing only proteins that your pet has never eaten before. A veterinary diet may also be needed. A diet trial typically lasts three to eight weeks. Pets should only eat that diet during this time. Currently available blood tests for food allergies in cats are not as reliable as a diet trial. Depending on test results, there are two main treatment options for cats with chronic diarrhea: A low-fat/high-fiber diet . This is recommended for cats with uncomplicated pancreatitis, infections, mechanical obstructions, or thyroid disease. For thyroid disease, a thyroid-specific diet (like Hill's Prescription Diet y/d Thyroid Care Original Flavor Dry Cat Food ) may alternatively be recommended. A novel protein/hydrolyzed diet . This is recommended for cats with food allergies or other diet-responsive conditions, such as IBD. These are mostly prescription diets, so you’ll need veterinary approval. Ask your veterinarian what type of diet is best for your cat. Recovery from chronic diarrhea in cats depends on the primary cause. In some cats, general changes in diet and digestive support may improve fecal firmness. Cats with diarrhea caused by specific issues such as intestinal parasites, unregulated diabetes, or thyroid disease can have their diarrhea resolved within weeks of treatment, while others may need lifelong therapy to control their symptoms. While the diarrhea itself may resolve, some of these conditions (diabetes, medically managed hyperthyroidism) will also require lifelong management. Cats with a chronic disease, senior cats, kittens, and pregnant cats should all be examined by a vet immediately after chronic diarrhea is noted. If your cat’s diarrhea contains blood and is accompanied by vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, or lack of appetite, take them to a vet immediately. For those cats that continue to eat well, have a good weight, and have normal energy levels, a few options are available for you to try at home: Diet trial using an over the counter “sensitive stomach” food, such as Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach & Sensitive Skin Chicken & Rice Recipe Dry Cat Food Fiber supplement or canned pumpkin Feline-specific probiotics, like FortiFlora or Royal Canin Probiotics Digestive & Immune Health Powder Supplement If these options don’t help your pet's stool return to normal in a few days, or if additional symptoms arise, take your cat to your primary care veterinarian immediately. Never give your cat over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications for humans, like Pepto Bismol and Imodium, without first asking your veterinarian. These medications can have severe side effects in pets if not used properly. If you’re asking if your cat has been having diarrhea for too long, chances are that it’s been too long! There is no set time for what, and it depends on the severity and other symptoms. If your cat’s diarrhea has only lasted a day but is severe and accompanied by vomiting and loss of appetite, they need to be evaluated by a veterinarian. If it’s been occasional for a week or more or is worsening over time, they should be seen. If your cat has had loose stools occasionally or continuously for three weeks or more, their diarrhea is considered chronic.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_renal_failure_chronic,Chronic Renal Failure in Cats,"Chronic renal failure (CRF), renal insufficiency, or chronic kidney disease (CKD) are medical terms used to describe when the kidneys are unable to perform their required tasks at a normal level of efficiency. Kidneys play a vital role in filtering waste from the body. A cat has two kidneys located on each side of the abdomen. The kidneys serve to regulate the body’s balance of fluids, minerals, and electrolytes. They conserve water, protein, and play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and red blood cell production by making a hormone called erythropoietin . CRF is classified into four stages, based on the severity of clinical signs and laboratory values. These are often progressive, though the timeline may vary: Stage I: Clinical signs are usually not apparent Stage II: Some clinical signs are noted Stage III: Many clinical signs are noted, and cats often appear to feel sick Stage IV: A majority of clinical signs are noted and cats are in crisis CRF is often diagnosed later in a cat’s life, but it can develop at any time. Certain breeds—such as Persians, Abyssinians, Siamese, Ragdoll, Burmese, Russian Blue, and Maine Coon—are predisposed. CRF, if diagnosed at an earlier age, is often associated with a heritable condition. It can also occur secondary to an acute kidney injury, such as ingesting a lily plant. Clinical signs are often related to the severity of the CRF stage, meaning there are additional, more severe signs noted within stages III and IV rather than with stages I and II. Cats often exhibit symptoms including: Increased thirst and urination Intermittent vomiting Dehydration Sores in the mouth Foul breath Weight loss Decreased appetite The term chronic , as in chronic renal failure, means that the process has been ongoing and progressive, and cannot be reversed. For some cats, the disease could have occurred after a serious kidney injury or from a severe infection (including feline infectious peritonitis , feline immunodeficiency virus , and pyelonephritis). It can also occur due to ingestion of a toxic substance like antifreeze or lilies, or certain medications. For others, CRF could be inherited, as with polycystic kidney disease (a specific type of renal kidney disease) and amyloidosis (a rare organ disease), seen in breeds like Persians and Abyssinians. CRF could also be attributed to underlying immune-mediated diseases, stroke-like events, clotting disorders, and cancer like lymphoma. CRF is often diagnosed based on routine blood work and a urinalysis, looking specifically at kidney markers such as: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a by-product of protein metabolism. Higher values can often indicate kidney failure. Creatinine (CREA) measures how well kidneys are filtering waste from blood, Phosphorous in elevated levels typically indicate kidney damage. Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride) often fluctuate between high and low levels Calcium at elevated levels may be seen with kidney failure. Red blood cell count may indicate kidney failure, when low. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is an additional test to help determine if kidney disease is present. It can be used for early detection of kidney disease. Urine specific gravity is a marker of how diluted or concentrated the urine is. Usually, the higher the number, the more concentrated the urine, and the greater the ability of the kidneys to conserve water. Your veterinarian will most likely recommend additional diagnostic testing, including: A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to quantify how much protein is being lost in the urine. A urine culture for cats in chronic kidney disease (CKD) , as they are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections. A blood pressure evaluation because cats in CKD are more likely to suffer from hypertension (high blood pressure). Radiographs or an abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones or infarcts (areas of dead tissue). Kidney removal is not an option since cats need their kidneys to survive. Dialysis in cats is an extremely uncommon treatment option. However, with early intervention, including routine lab work and annual exams, treatment of chronic renal failure is possible. CRF can be managed with a combination of medications and proper diet. Your vet will be able to determine which treatment plan is most beneficial, depending on the stage of the disease. It’s important to note for all stages of kidney disease, water should always be available. Since CRF affects a cat’s hydration, if any additional disease or illness hinders the cat’s hydration, it’s important to treat it promptly with IV fluids. Chronic renal failure is not curable and often progressive (although the timeline is variable). Cats diagnosed early enough can benefit from nutritional management and more frequent veterinary attention, which may include more frequent checkups and blood work. Cats in stages I and II may be monitored for further progression of signs, and some may be given a prescription diet specifically geared to help the kidneys by limiting the amount of work they have to do. Many cats can go on to have a decent quality of life for many months to years. Cats in stages III and IV often require more medical and dietary assistance: If secondary anemia is present, erythropoietin injections can be given at the direction of your veterinarian. Dietary supplements may be prescribed to help with low potassium. Phosphorus binders may be prescribed to treat high phosphorus levels. Anti-nausea and anti-emetic (anti-vomiting) medications can be given to cats with a poor appetite, vomiting, or nausea. Fluids given either intravenously—or underneath the skin—can help with dehydration. Your veterinarian can show you how to administer these fluids at home. There is no cure for CRF. However, if CRF is caught early and managed correctly, most cats that experience kidney disease can live a relatively normal life with some changes and long-term management. Cats that have developed CRF have a much more favorable prognosis than cats suffering from acute kidney injury. Depending on the stage at diagnosis, cats in CRF can go on to live for several more years. CRF in cats is not a painful condition, but it can be quite debilitating.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/chronic-vomiting-cats,Chronic Vomiting in Cats,"As a cat parent, it doesn’t take long to realize that cleaning up vomit is a common occurrence. Occasional vomiting is normal in cats, but if it happens regularly, then it often has an underlying cause and should be investigated. Vomiting in cats usually follows drooling, excessive swallowing, retching, nausea, and a lack of appetite. Occasional vomiting or acute vomiting (lasting more than 7 days) can often be a normal reflex to hair buildup in the cat’s stomach or as a protective mechanism. Chronic vomiting (persisting more than 3 weeks) is caused by many conditions and diseases. It can often be a true medical or even surgical emergency. If you think your cat suffers from chronic vomiting, seek the advice of your veterinarian immediately. Besides vomiting, which may contain blood , cats with chronic vomiting often have other symptoms including: Dehydration Lethargy Foul breath Fever Weight loss Decreased appetite Behavioral changes Increased thirst Increased urination Unkempt hair coat Painful abdomen Palpable thickened intestines Palpable masses in abdomen Diarrhea (bright-red bloody or black tarry stools) Vomiting has many causes that may or may not be related to the gastrointestinal tract, which makes determining the specific cause frustrating for veterinarians. Your veterinarian considers your cat’s age, lifestyle, and environment to help narrow down the cause of their chronic vomiting. For example, given their inquisitive and playful nature, kittens may ingest foreign objects causing gastrointestinal obstruction and vomiting, and cats allowed outdoors may have chronic vomiting due to bacterial or parasitic infections. Medium- and long-haired cats vomit more often because they ingest hair while grooming themselves. Excessive grooming causes a buildup of hair (hairballs) in the stomach. These hairballs are often passed undigested in the cat’s feces, or they are occasionally vomited. You can minimize your cat’s excessive grooming behavior by routinely grooming and brushing them, feeding them a special diet, giving them hairball medication, and keeping them on a strict flea control medication schedule. Other more serious causes of chronic vomiting in cats include: Infections (bacterial, viral, parasitic) Endocrine disorders (diabetes, hyperthyroidism, liver or kidney disease) Pancreatitis Electrolyte disturbances Obstruction (due to ingestion of a foreign object, cancer, or intestinal obstruction Certain medications or toxins Food allergies or intolerance Gastrointestinal disorders Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Psychogenic disorders (due to chronic fear or stress) Your veterinarian usually performs a physical exam to determine the type of care your cat needs, Additional testing may include: Stool testing and urinalysis Bloodwork X-ray and ultrasound imaging Biopsy of the gastrointestinal tract or mass (through endoscopy, laparoscopy, or exploratory surgery) Test results in cats with a chronic vomiting diagnosis may show signs of: Anemia (low red blood cell count due to chronic blood loss or inflammation) Erythrocytosis (high red blood cell count due to dehydration) Low proteins (albumin, cholesterol) Electrolyte disturbances Increased liver enzymes (ALT, ALKP) Increased kidney enzymes (CREA, BUN, phosphorous) Organ size (presence of tumors or foreign bodies) Increased thickness of the intestinal walls; changes in intestinal function Further tests may include PLI/TLI/folate/cobalamin to determine absorption ability and markers of pancreatic inflammation, as well as stool cultures or PCR panels to determine the presence of infectious agents. Also, if food intolerance or allergy is a known cause, your veterinarian may recommend a food trial for diagnostic and treatment purposes. This may entail a novel protein diet (consisting of less common sources of protein, such as fish, duck, rabbit, venison, or kangaroo) or a hydrolyzed diet , where the protein is chemically broken into pieces so the immune system is less likely to react. In some cases, this may be effective as the sole therapy. The primary goal of treatment is to identify the real cause of chronic vomiting so that targeted treatment can be prescribed. For example, hyperthyroidism in cats can be treated with medications, diet, radiation, and even surgery. Surgery is often done when there is a known ingestion of a foreign object, evidence of an obstruction, or evidence of certain cancers. Supportive care measures, such as IV fluid therapy or pain and antiemetic medications, are often prescribed. Medications such as maropitant citrate, metoclopramide, and ondansetron are used to treat the vomiting, help with nausea, and increase gastrointestinal motility. Appetite stimulants such as mirtazapine or capromorelin, vitamin B12 injections, or deworming agents may also be recommended. It is important to follow your veterinarian’s instructions throughout the treatment, as a combination of medications is typically required to treat your cat’s chronic vomiting. The prognosis of cats with more significant or severe disease is often guarded until the underlying cause is determined. Specific treatment to alleviate symptoms and increase comfort can improve your cat’s quality of life. Conditions caused by infections or foreign body obstructions offer a much better prognosis and often need only short-term medications and care. Endocrinopathies, such as hyperthyroidism and diabetes , can be managed, but treatments often require lifelong supplementation and monitoring. Cancer often carries a much more serious prognosis, and while some cancers can be cured, other types can only be managed until euthanasia is suggested. Certain reasons for vomiting, such as foreign body obstructions, are preventable. So veterinarians advise pet parents to be vigilant and block their cat’s access to trash, hair ties, string, and other small objects. If your cat has thrown up excessively, if the vomit contains blood or any unusual objects, or if your cat is showing any other symptom as noted above, seek veterinary care immediately. Also, if your cat has a chronic condition such as diabetes or kidney disease, any vomiting should prompt a conversation or a visit with your veterinarian. Chronic vomiting and vomiting associated with symptoms of systemic disease, such as weight loss, fever, dehydration, or pain, should be treated as an emergency. 1. Little S.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_chylothorax,Chylothorax in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Chyle is a milky to slightly yellow fluid made up of lymph and fats from the intestines and transferred to the circulation through the thoracic duct (the main trunk of the lymphatic system, which crosses the chest near the spine and empties into the circulation system), and lymph is a watery fluid that is produced by the tissues of the body and which contains white blood cells, which are essential for protecting the body. Chylothorax is a medical condition that results from the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the pleural (chest) cavity where the heart and lungs reside, with the main culprit being chyle. Chyle is a digestive fluid that is formed in the small intestine and conveyed by the thoracic duct to the veins. En route to the veins, chyle can leak into the chest cavity, accumulating there and causing excessive pressure on the chest and its organs. Lymph travels through the lymphatic vessels, transporting lymphocytes (white cells that function specifically for cellular immunity) and fats from the small intestines to the blood stream. Commonly, when chyle has accumulated in the chest cavity, blockage or obstruction of the lymphatic vessels will occur, causing the vessels to dilate and affecting the tissue that covers the lungs and lines the inner chest cavity. This tissue becomes inflamed and scar tissue forms, narrowing the space and constricting the lungs. Severe breathing problems may result. In cats, Asian breeds such as the Siamese and Himalayan seem to have a higher number of cases than other breeds. Any age can be affected, but aging cats are more likely to develop the condition, and the condition is suspected of being associated with cancer. Symptoms can vary according to the underlying cause, how rapidly the fluid has accumulated, and the volume of fluid present. Struggling with breathing is the first sign of a problem, but if fluid has accumulated gradually, the condition may have existed before the appearance of breathing problems. There are several other attendant symptoms that can be taken into account when looking for the underlying cause of the breathing problem. Your cat may present some, or all, of these symptoms: The cause of chylothorax is usually unknown, but some of the instigators that have been found to cause it have been masses in the chest cavity (tumors), nodular lesions caused by a fungal infection, blood clots in veins, heart surgery, heart disease, and heartworm disease. There may also be a congenital element in the formation of this disease, and is suspected to be the case for some breeds. But in general, the cause is typically idiopathic (of unknown origin). Your veterinarian will need to draw some fluid from the chest. If chyle is found in the fluid, it will help your doctor to draw a firm conclusion as to the cause. Before fluid is withdrawn, your doctor may want to perform an ultrasound examination on the chest to check for masses in the internal chest cavity, and to check the heart and its structural condition to ensure that the correct diagnosis is made. X-ray imaging of the chest, before and after fluid has been removed, will present your veterinarian with a clear direction in which to progress. Further imaging may include a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan using a dye injection that will provide a visual point of reference as it travels through the system to reveal more accurately any blockages or obstructions. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause, but a pleural tap to remove fluid from the chest cavity and improve breathing will be one of the primary actions. If the fluid has accumulated rapidly as the result of a trauma, chest tubes will be used to quickly relieve the pressure from the chest organs and prevent dilation of the lymphatic vessels. If accumulation of fluid continues, your veterinarian will need to continue the use of tubes to keep the chest clear, and will probably recommend surgery. The most common and effective surgical treatment is to bind the thoracic duct, and remove a part of the membranous sac that envelopes the heart. Continued use of chest tubes after surgery is likely until your doctor is confident that the chest cavity will remain clear on its own. Also, depending on the underlying cause, your veterinarian may prescribe medications for treatment, post-treatment, or maintenance. Ongoing care and maintenance will include periodic pleural taps to remove fluid from the chest cavity. Even if your cat recovers, you will want to have it evaluated from time to time for several years. Asking your veterinarian to do this during routine exams should be sufficient, unless your are advised to do otherwise. You will need to monitor your pet carefully for breathing problems or for the recurrence of attendant symptoms (see description of symptoms above). Chylothorax will sometimes resolve spontaneously, or after surgery, but for some animals there is no effective treatment that will resolve it. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_cirrhosis_fibrosis_of_liver,Cirrhosis and Fibrosis of the Liver in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Put simply, cirrhosis of the liver is the generalized (diffuse) formation of scar tissue. It is associated with regenerative nodules, or masses, and deranged liver architecture. Fibrosis of the liver, on the other hand, involves the formation of scar tissue that replaces normal liver tissue. This condition can be inherited or acquired. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out other causes of disease are also standard examination procedures. A fine needle aspirate should be taken from the liver for a sample to be sent for cytologic analysis. A liver biopsy taken via laparoscope may also be necessary to form a definitive diagnosis. Patients with minimal signs can be treated on an outpatient basis as long as they are still eating normally. Patients with more severe signs should be hospitalized, given fluid therapy if necessary and have a feeding tube inserted if they are showing symptoms of anorexia. Electrolytes may be supplemented while administering fluids, and some patients respond well to B-complex vitamins. If there is abdominal fluid build-up, the fluid will need to be tapped and removed, and sodium restricted in the diet until the cause of the build-up has been resolved. Cats displaying signs of hepatic encephalopathy (ammonia buildup in the blood causing neurologic signs) will need to have food withheld, as should cats that are vomiting and/or suffering from inflammation of the pancreas. Such patients should have individualized protein portions suited to their level of hepatic dysfunction. Albumin levels should be maintained. If surgery is being considered, a clotting profile will need to be performed. This is due to a concern that patients with longer clotting times will have an increased chance of bleeding, even during minor surgeries. Your veterinarian will schedule regular check-ups with you for your cat. At these visits, blood work will be done, including monitoring of total serum bile acids. Your veterinarian will also observe your cat’s overall body condition and observe to see if fluid is building up in the abdomen. Contact your veterinarian if your cat appears to have a larger than normal abdomen, is behaving strangely, or seems to be losing weight. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_nail_nailbed_disorders,Claw and Nail Disorders in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Nail and nail bed disorders may refer to any abnormality or disease that affects the claws or the surrounding area. The disorders are generally known as dystrophies. One type of nail disorder, paronychia, is an infection that causes inflammation of the tissue around the nail or claw. Onychomycosis, or fungal infection, can also occur in and around the nail bed. Cats may exhibit extremely brittle nails (onychorrhexis), or have nails that separate, peel, and slough excessively (onychomadesis). Most nail or nail bed disorders have an excellent treatment prognosis and can be remedied in a relatively short amount of time. Common signs of nail or nail bed disorders can include: Some of the most common causes for nail or nail bed disorders can include: In the event that your cat is suffering from a trauma to the nail bed, you will want to check to see if it has affected only a single nail. If multiple nails are being affected, a serious underlying medical condition is the more likely cause for the disorder. A skin scraping may be taken to determine what type of a skin condition your cat is experiencing, and a bacterial or fungal culture may also be taken for further analysis. Treatment will be dependent upon the particular underlying medical condition that is causing the nail or nail bed condition. If the nail area is inflamed, surgical removal of the nail plate (the hard portion) may be necessary to encourage drainage of the underlying tissue. Antimicrobial soaks can also be effective for reducing inflammation and encouraging the healing process. If the condition is related to a bacteria or a fungus, topical treatments and/or ointments are often administered to the affected area. In most cases, application of the topical treatment or ointment will clear up any nail issues. While there are typically not many serious complications that can arise from these disorders, it is important to observe your cat's recovery and to act promptly if healing does not progress in a positive direction. One way to protect your vat from suffering a nail injury or disorder is to avoid cutting too close to the nail bed (the quick) when trimming the nails. Nicks to the skin can occur, opening your cat to infection as it goes about its normal routine (i.e., using the litter box, exploring). It is essential to look closely at your cat's nails before cutting them, so that you can determine exactly where the quick of the nail is – that is, the part of the nail bed that overlays the tissue and blood vessels. You do not want cut into that part of the nail; only the free edge that extends past the nail bed should be trimmed. Researching the proper way to cut your cat's nails, paying close attention, and promptly cleansing the area when an inadvertent injury does occur will go a long way toward protecting your cat from a painful nail disorder or trauma.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/cleft-palate-cats-treatment-and-more,Cleft Palate in Cats: Treatment and More,"FatCamera/E+ via Getty Images A cat’s palate is the roof of their mouth. If you run your tongue along the roof of your mouth, the hard surface is called the hard palate. As you move your tongue backward toward your throat, you’ll reach a softer surface, which is called the soft palate. Like us, cats have both a hard palate and a soft palate. Kittens can also be born with a defect called a cleft palate. A cleft palate in cats is a defect that occurs while a fetal kitten develops in a mother cat’s uterus. Among birth defects in kittens, cleft palates are an easy one to identify. During normal development, the two sides of the roof of the mouth come together and fuse. When a cat has a cleft palate, this fusion doesn’t occur normally, and there's essentially a split in the roof of the mouth. As a result, there is an opening between the mouth and the nasal passages. Let's take a look at everything you need to know about cleft palate in cats—from symptoms and treatment to management and prevention. A cat can have a primary palate defect or a secondary palate defect. A primary palate defect occurs when there is a split in the upper lip and the very front of the hard palate (around the incisor teeth). A secondary palate defect occurs when there is a split in the hard and soft palate or just the soft palate alone. A cleft palate in cats isn’t common. However, when it does occur, purebred cats— specifically Siamese cats —have the highest risk of developing the defect. Symptoms of a cleft palate in cats are usually noticed at birth or when the cat is still a kitten. These symptoms include: A visible split in the upper lip or roof of the mouth Nasal congestion and discharge Sneezing Difficulty nursing (milk coming out of nose) Coughing Gagging Pneumonia Poor weight gain Genetics play a role in the development of congenital cleft palates in cats. This is why the Siamese cat has a higher incidence of cleft palate and why the condition is more common in purebred animals. Cleft palate defects can also occur in the offspring of pregnant cats due to: Nutritional imbalances during pregnancy Taking certain medications while pregnant, such as steroids like prednisolone Trauma to the mother while the fetus is developing Viral infections affecting the mother during pregnancy, such as panleukopenia or calicivirus A cleft palate in cats is diagnosed by visual inspection of a kitten’s lip and the inside of their mouth. No additional tests are needed to diagnose a cleft palate in cats. However, if the cat has signs of pneumonia, chest X-rays may be performed to check for the condition. The pet parent should let the veterinarian know if they’ve noticed the kitten having difficulty nursing or milk coming out of the nose. If a cleft palate in cats is restricted to the lip area, treatment may not be necessary unless the cat develops symptoms of an infection or has difficulty nursing. In some cases, a small repair can be done for cosmetic reasons. Cleft palates that involve the soft palate or both the hard and soft palate are more serious. These kittens may need to be fed via a tube until they’re old enough for surgery, generally when they’re around 3 to 4 months of age. Feeding options could include a a milk replacer or a suitable diet like Hill’s® a/d . Your veterinarian may be able to teach you how to tube-feed. They will also discuss which diet is best for your kitten. Tube feeding prevents the kitten from inhaling milk into their lungs. Inhaled milk can cause aspiration pneumonia , which can be life-threatening. Surgery to repair a cleft palate is complicated, and not all veterinarians are comfortable performing this procedure. Several teeth may need to be extracted so that the surgeon has more soft tissue to work with. The surgeon will use some of the soft tissue in the roof of the mouth to close the opening between the nose and mouth. Recovery from cleft palate surgery in cats is long. Cats should eat soft food and not be allowed to chew on toys or treats for at least four weeks after surgery. Kittens will likely go home with several days of pain control medication , such as an anti-inflammatory like meloxicam . A recovery cone may also be placed on your kitten to keep them from pawing at their face. Your veterinarian may want to frequently recheck your kitten to make sure the surgical site is healing appropriately . Generally, sutures in the mouth will dissolve. If there are sutures in the lip, the veterinarian may want to remove them about two weeks after surgery. It’s possible for multiple procedures to be required to completely fix a defect. Without surgery, the prognosis for a secondary palate defect (soft palate or both hard and soft palate) is poor. Let's look at a few ways you can prevent cleft palate in cats. Cats with cleft palates should not be bred, to avoid passing the condition on. Veterinarians should avoid giving steroids like prednisolone, other medications like antifungal griseofulvin, or supplements with high levels of vitamin A, which can all cause congenital defects if given to a pregnant cat. Pet parents should keep their cats up to date on vaccines prior to pregnancy. It’s also best to keep a pregnant cat safely inside to avoid injury. It’s possible for adult cats to develop what is called an acquired palate defect due to trauma—like being hit by a car or falling from a high place . To avoid this sort of traumatic injury, it’s best to keep your cat safely inside. Not all cats with cleft palates will survive. Aspiration pneumonia can be deadly, and not all surgical repairs will be successful. Without surgery, most cats who have a defect that affect the main part of their hard palate and/or their soft palate will eventually develop aspiration pneumonia. Cleft palates can only be fixed surgically. This is a complicated procedure that sometimes includes removing teeth so that the tissues of the mouth can be mobilized to close the defect in the palate. If the cleft palate only affects the lip and the very front of the mouth around the incisors, prognosis is good. For other cleft palates, prognosis is guarded unless you can tube-feed the kitten until the kitten can get surgery. However, a kitten who does get fed via tube and who has a successful surgery has a good prognosis. WRITTEN BY Veterinarian Dr. Rhiannon Koehler is a veterinarian and freelance medical writer.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_coagulation_factor_deficiency,Clotting Deficiency (Inherited)) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Coagulation takes place when blood transforms from a free flowing liquid into a thickened gel like state. In this state the gelled blood is called a clot, and it is through clotting that a wound begins to seal. This process is critically important for healing to take place. When your pet is injured and continues to bleed uncontrollably, this may be symptomatic of a defect in one or more of the processes that bring about coagulation. A complex series of enzyme reactions are involved in turning blood from a fluid to a gel, and a failure in one of these processes can cause prolonged hemorrhaging after an injury, and will result ultimately in blood loss anemia. The failure of blood to coagulate can also result in internal hemorrhaging. Knowing the symptoms to watch for is crucial. Symptoms of coagulation factor deficiency can include prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma, an obvious external symptom. Some of the less obvious symptoms that can be indicative of a coagulation deficiency are related to blood loss anemia and internal bleeding. With blood loss anemia, symptoms can present as weakness, lethargy, short breath, irregular heart beat, confusion, and a condition known medically as pica -- a compulsive eating behavior that is often intended to balance a lack of minerals or vitamins in the blood; in this case, iron deficiency from loss of blood. The animal will crave and eat non-food items, such as stones, dirt, and feces, amongst other things. Internal bleeding may present as bloody vomit or stools, bleeding from the rectum or vagina, difficulty breathing, abnormal heart rhythm, swollen or hard abdomen, and excessive thirst. Several factors can determine the probability that your pet is suffering from coagulation factor deficiency. An underlying disorder, such as vitamin K deficiency, can affect the functioning of the liver, one of the primary sites for synthesizing the enzymes necessary for coagulation. Other problems with the liver can also affect the process of enzyme synthesization. The underlying cause for coagulation deficiency can also be predisposed by hereditary traits. An example of this is Hemophilia. Both the A and B forms of hemophilia are x-linked recessive traits, where males bleed excessively and the females carry the trait and pass it on. Hemophilia is characterized by an abnormally low amount of the protein needed to bind blood platelets into a clot. This protein process is one of the coagulation factors that the body utilizes for clotting external and internal wounds. Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, and is not always inherited. It can also develop when the body forms antibodies that block the coagulation factor processes. Severe deficiency of coagulating factors will usually become apparent by four to six months of age. Milder deficiency may show up after an injury or after surgery. In addition, external environmental circumstances may play a role in the incidence of coagulation factor deficiency. Ingestion of rat poison, or a snake bite, can affect the body's ability to process enzymes and proteins normally. Medically prescribed medications can affect the blood's ability to clot as well. Long term use of antibiotics can cause complications, and the use of prescription Heparin as an anti-coagulant (used for breaking up blood clots in the veins) can result in an accidental overdose. Your veterinarian may first want to rule out external factors, such as access to rodent poison, or recent contact with a snake or a lizard. A complete blood test will be ordered, and an assay of the blood's ability to coagulate will be used to determine the source of the disorder. If your pet shows signs of increased red blood cells (RBC), an indication of regenerative anemia, it will signal the possibility of internal blood loss. If blood loss is severe, your pet will be hospitalized and will receive blood and plasma transfusions. In fact, repeated transfusions may be necessary to control or prevent further hemorrhaging. Your veterinarian will probably also prescribe vitamin K, especially if your pet has ingested rodent poison or is experiencing other conditions that deplete this vitamin. Your doctor will continue to test your cat's blood on an ongoing basis to determine the effectiveness of vitamin K supplementation, if it has been prescribed. It should begin to normalize 24 to 48 hours after the beginning of therapy. The only way to test whether a hereditary deficiency has been treated successfully is by factor analysis; whether the hematomas (collections of clotted blood) have been resolved, and most importantly, whether the bleeding has stopped. Transfusion sometimes causes immune reactions when antibodies resist the new blood. If transfusion is a decided treatment, your pet will need to be monitored for symptoms of rejection. There is no particular breed that is more susceptible than another, so there is nothing that can be done to prevent it unless it is known to be in the genetic makeup of your cat's family line. If it is determined that a hereditary factor is responsible for the coagulation factor deficiency, it is best not to breed this animal. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_coagulopathy_of_liver_disease,Clotting Deficiency (Liver Related) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The liver is vital for the synthesis of anticoagulant, coagulation, and fibrinolytic proteins. In fact, only five blood clotting factors are not produced there. Therefore, liver diseases that cause clotting issues in cats can be very serious and sometimes life-threatening. The causes of coagulopathy of liver disease are abundant, including: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), and electrolyte panel. Hemostatic tests like prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), activated clotting time (ACT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin clotting time (TCT), and Proteins invoked by Vitamin K Absence (PIVKA) are useful for measuring the severity of the cat’s inability to clot normally. Tests can also be performed to detect low coagulation/anticoagulant factor (antithrombin (AT) and protein (C) activity. X-rays, meanwhile, are used to identify liver abnormalities, fluid in the abdomen, abnormal intestinal motility and thickening in affected areas. In many cases, invasive procedures are unnecessary unless there is severe hemorrhaging. Fresh whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate or platelet-rich plasma are viable options to treat hemostatic disorders. However, If the cat has fluid buildup in the abdomen, a sample should be taken to determine if it is due to a hemorrhage or ascites. This must be done with extreme care to avoid exacerbating the problem. A vitamin-rich, well-balanced diet is vital for a quick recovery. Deworming your pet of parasites can also help prevent future intestinal bleeding. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_clotting_disorders_platelets,Clotting Disorders of the Platelets in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Thrombocytopathic animals are those which typically have normal platelet counts on examination, but have spontaneous or excessive bleeding due to a failure of the platelets to bind to each other, or clot normally. Thrombocytopathies are defined as disorders of the blood platelet and abnormal functioning of the platelets. Bleeding from the mucous membranes – nose, mouth ears, anus – is the most common sign. Thrombocytopathies may first become apparent in young animals when excessive bleeding occurs with the loss of baby teeth. Thrombocytopathies can be acquired or hereditary; they affect the main functions of platelets: activation, adhesion and aggregation. That is, they lack the ability to group together and adhere to each other, an important function for sealing wounds. This can result in severe bleeding from even the smallest wound. Animals having a low blood platelet count with concurrent thrombocytopathia will bleed more excessively than expected for the existent platelet count. Any breed of cat can be affected by acquired thrombocytopathies. Acquired thrombocytopathy Hereditary thrombocytopathy Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat after taking a full medical and background history, and a description of the onset of symptoms from you. Your veterinarian will order a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The complete blood count may show a condition of anemia if bleeding has been severe. Platelet counts are often normal in cats with inherited thrombocytopathies. A von Willebrand disease assay can be performed if your cat is suspected of having this disease. Platelet function testing can also be done in select laboratories. Coagulation tests (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT]) should be ordered to eliminate coagulopathy (a disease affecting the blood's ability to clot) as a cause of the excessive bleeding. Mucosal bleeding time can be measured by making a small incision on the inside of the cheek (buccal) in the mouth. The amount of blood and length of time it takes for the incision to be sealed with a clot of blood will either confirm or rule out a clotting disorder. Patients may be given a platelet transfusion to increase the number of platelets. This is also appropriate treatment if the underlying cause is von Willebrand disease. Patients should be transfused with platelets as a preventative measure or if it is noted that they are bleeding out. If your cat is anemic, whole blood or packed red cells should be transfused. Patients with prolonged buccal mucosal times should be given special preparation before any surgery to prevent excessive bleeding during procedures. In addition, veterinarians should minimize injections to the patient and apply extended pressure after intravenous injections, intravenous catheterization, and invasive procedures. Animals with acquired thrombocytopathies should have the underlying cause of the disease treated. This means withdrawing them from certain medicines if necessary. Thrombocyopathic pets may bleed at home, but it is very rare that they will bleed to death. Restrict your cat's activity during a bleeding episode to minimize the amount lost, and try to avoid feeding hard foods to your cat, as some foods may cause friction to the gum tissue, resulting in bleeding. If a hereditary disorder is found to be underlying the clotting disorder, it is advisable to have your cat fixed so that it cannot breed. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_coccidiosis,Coccidia in Cats,"Coccidia are single-celled (protozoan) parasites that nearly all cats are exposed to in their lifetime. The parasite travels into the intestinal lining cells of the cat, where it matures over about two weeks into oocysts, rupturing the cells and causing intestinal damage. These oocysts then pass through the intestines into the stool to finish their life cycle, become infective (sporulate), and spread into the environment. It takes no more than 16 hours for a passed oocyst to sporulate into an infective state. Once in that state, they can survive for up to year in temperate environments. There are many species of coccidia that infect many different animals, but almost all these parasites are host-specific, meaning a cat cannot transmit an infection to a dog or human, they can only transmit it to other cats. An infection with coccidia does not always mean an illness is present. Many cats will eliminate the parasite on their own while others may shed oocysts in their stool without ever showing symptoms (asymptomatic). When illness (coccidiosis) does occur, it is often in young kittens or older cats with poor immune systems. As the life cycle of these parasites occurs in the intestines, signs of illness are related to the digestive system. Diarrhea is most common and may be associated with weight loss. Cats can become dehydrated (especially young kittens), and reluctant to engage in normal, playful behaviors. Only in rare cases will there be vomiting and loss of appetite. These symptoms may be aggravated by stressful environmental changes like adoption, weaning, or living in an animal shelter. Most cats, particularly those who spend time outdoors, pick up this parasite from their environment, grooming it off their fur and feet. Mice, rats, and other common prey species are known as transport hosts because they can carry certain life stages of coccidia, which then infect the cats who hunt them. Cats who share a litterbox with an infected cat risk picking up the parasite themselves, even if they do not hunt or go outside. A veterinarian will take into consideration the cat’s history, symptoms, and use a microscope to determine if oocysts are present. Coccidia is diagnosed through a stool sample. In this testing, fecal matter is mixed with a special solution that allows the oocysts to float to the surface, where they can be collected on a slide and examined under a microscope. Each species of coccidia has a unique oocyst appearance that can be identified. Coccidia is usually eliminated in cats with an oral antimicrobial medication. Sulfadimethoxine ( Albon® ) is the most commonly used product, though there are other medications that may be recommended. Depending on the severity of the cat’s illness, antimicrobial treatment is often combined with medications to help alleviate symptoms, such as probiotics, low residue diets, anti-nausea medications, and fluid therapy. Cats that are properly treated and supported typically make a full recovery from coccidiosis. Daily removal of feces from the litterbox, routine cleaning of the environment, and treating all cats in contact with the infected cat are recommended to prevent the spread of disease. Cats with outdoor access and cats who like to hunt should have fecal flotation tests completed annually to look for asymptomatic infections. Asymptomatic cats frequently eliminate coccidia infections on their own. Cats with signs of illness may recover without intervention, but they will likely be in significant discomfort. It is not recommended that infected cats recover without medication as it will prolong illness and they are likely to spread the infection to other cats. Untreated clinical coccidiosis can lead to dehydration, weight loss, lack of appetite, and even death. Certain life stages of coccidia can live for months in the environment, including carpeting. It is important to clean litterboxes daily to prevent maturation of coccidia oocysts. Mature or sporulated oocysts are more resistant to most common disinfectants. Treating infected animals and keeping the environment clean are the most important steps. Coccidia is host-specific, meaning the specific species that infects cats can only infect cats. There is no risk to other kinds of household pets. Humans are not susceptible to infection from feline coccidiosis. Coccidiosis should only be treated under the supervision of a veterinarian with FDA-approved medications.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_coccidioidomycosis,Coccidioidomycosis in Cats,"Coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever, is a disease caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis . Cats get infected with this disease after inhaling the spores from the air. It is transmitted to many species of animals, including cats and people, but dogs seem to be the most severely affected . Since this infection enters the body by inhalation, it goes directly to the cat’s lungs, causing a local infection in the respiratory system. From the lungs, it can be absorbed into the bloodstream and travel to other parts of the body, which is called a disseminated infection. Disseminated infections are much more serious, but either form of coccidioidomycosis can be fatal in cats. Approximately 50% of infected cats appear to have disseminated disease. This fungus is found in the soil predominantly in the U.S. Southwest, in a very dry region known as the Lower Sonoran life zone. It has also been reported in Northern Mexico, Central America, and South America in regions with the same arid and semi-arid climates. Recently it has been reported as far north as Washington State. Clinical signs tend to develop within a few weeks after spores are inhaled into the lungs. If the fungal spores escape the lungs and travel throughout the body, it can take several months after the initial cough for other signs to develop. Sometimes the initial cough can be mild, and infection can go undetected until the animal is very ill. Other areas of the body commonly affected in cats with disseminated coccidioidomycosis are the skin, muscles, bones, brain, spinal cord, and eyes. It’s very important to have your cat examined by their veterinarian at the first sign of any illness or abnormality, even if it does not seem significant at the time. A cough in cats should always be taken seriously, as it can be an indication of a medical emergency. Early signs: Coughing Lethargy Fever Lack of appetite Severe cases, disseminated signs: Skin issues such as non-healing, infected, draining tracts, masses, or abscesses Joint pain, presenting as lameness/limping, weakness, trouble getting up and down Back and neck pain Seizures Blindness As noted, coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever, occurs after cats inhale fungal spores. This illness can occur in a cat that has inhaled fewer than 10 microscopic fungal spores. Coccidioidomycosis is a dimorphic fungus, which means it can exist both as yeast (single cell) and mold (multicellular). This fungal organism grows deep in the soil and can survive at high temperatures and low moisture in desert regions. During the rainy season, this fungus will return to the surface of the soil and produce spores, which are spread rapidly by wind. Cats are most often infected after the soil has been disturbed, such as after rainfall, a dust storm, an earthquake, a crop harvest, or during construction. Most cats infected with valley fever are young, as these are the cats that tend to be most active outdoors. Cats that dig in the dirt or that live in areas where they are in or around dust storms may also be at greater risk for exposure. For cats living in areas where Valley Fever has been reported, keeping them indoors, especially during the rainy season or when major weather events occur, is highly recommended. Rapid spread of this fungal disease may occur when rainy periods are followed by drought, resulting in dust storms. In general, valley fever is not contagious among cats, between cats and dogs, or between cats and people. However, in one case from 2008 in which a veterinary technician was bitten by a cat, the wound was diagnosed as coccidioidomycosis. An important aspect of diagnosing a valley fever infection is to know if your cat frequents the type of place that harbors the fungal organism, so providing your veterinarian with a detailed history of your pet’s activities is critical. A complete physical examination will also be performed, and full bloodwork (chemistry panel, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel) including urine testing is usually ordered to assess body function and to rule out other conditions that might cause similar signs. Diagnosis of valley fever can be very difficult in cats and is usually made through visualization of fungal organisms under the microscope. However, coccidioidomycosis should be considered in cats with consistent clinical signs within the endemic region — a particular area where a disease outbreak is known to have occurred. A special blood test called a titer is also important in making the diagnosis for valley fever. If your cat has lesions on the skin or other organs of the body, a biopsy may be needed to collect cells or remove a piece of abnormal tissue to test for the coccidioidomycosis-causing organism. These lesions can be found during physical examination as skin abscesses, on radiographs as lung nodules, or even using advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI for advanced lung disease or when other body systems are affected. In cats that are coughing with or without lung disease evident on the initial chest x-rays, an airway wash (tracheal wash or tracheal lavage) is typically ordered. This procedure requires your cat to be heavily sedated so that lung fluid samples can be collected for analysis. It is possible that your vet can see the fungal spores in this analysis, which would confirm the diagnosis. Most cats with coccidioidomycosis are treated at home rather than in the hospital. Treatment for cats with valley fever involves an extended course of oral antifungal medication, usually fluconazole . Hospitalization is highly dependent on how severely affected your cat is. Cats that are having breathing issues or are not eating are more likely to be hospitalized. Other supportive care may be necessary to help with symptoms, including oxygen therapy for those having trouble breathing, IV fluids, anti-inflammatories, appetite stimulants, or liver protectants. Antifungal medications often have side effects on the liver and gastrointestinal system. For this reason, it is important that your vet monitor your cat’s liver enzymes and other body functions with bloodwork and urine testing done routinely during and after treatment. Aggressive antifungal therapy is usually required from several months to over a year. The decision to stop antifungal medication will be determined after your cat’s clinical signs have resolved and after two blood tests are negative for active infection. If illness is limited to the lungs and treated with appropriate medication, the prognosis is good and the recovery rate approaches 90%. Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis for cats with disseminated coccidioidomycosis is guarded, as relapse of the disease is common following initial treatment. Many cats will improve with oral antifungal medication. However, relapses are common, especially if therapy is not completed as prescribed or is shortened unnecessarily. Recovery without treatment is not typical, but it is possible for an animal to develop an immunity to the infection and recover from it. Asymptomatic infections may occur, in which cats are exposed but develop immunity without experiencing the signs of the full-blown disease. Valley fever can be fatal if left untreated; however, once the disease is diagnosed, most cats will recover in time with consistent treatment and follow-up care with their veterinarian. The fungus causing valley fever is found in the soil, predominantly in the Lower Sonoran life zone in the U.S. Southwest and in Northern Mexico, Central America, and South America in regions with the same arid and semi-arid climates. It has, however, been reported as far north as Washington State. In general, valley fever is not contagious between cats and people. There is, however, one case in which a veterinary technician was infected after being bitten by cat with disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_tracheal_collapse,Collapse of the Wind Pipe in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Tracheal collapse may affect the part of the trachea that is located in the neck (cervical trachea), or it may affect the lower part of the trachea, located in the chest (intrathoracic trachea). The trachea is the large tube that carries air from the nose and throat to the small airways (bronchi) that go to the lungs, and collapse of the trachea describes a condition in which the tracheal cavity (lumen) has narrowed during breathing, making the process of breathing difficult to accomplish. Though tracheal collapse is rare in cats, it can affect cats of any age or gender. Symptoms of tracheal abnormalities seem to be aggravated by heat, excitement, exercise or obesity. The following symptoms are commonly observed in affected animals: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your cat. The routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count may show an abnormally high number of white blood cells (WBCs), indicative of infection. Diagnostic imaging is an essential part of the diagnostic process, since the lungs and trachea will need to be examined as completely as possible. Chest X-ray remains a valuable tool, and may reveal a collapsed trachea as well as to help your veterinarian find the location of collapse. In some cases, enlargement of the right side of the heart may also be found. Fluoroscopy, another advanced diagnostic technique, but one which can provide real time, active images of the internal body, may also be used for your cat. Fluoroscopy works by using an X-ray device placed in front of a fluorescent screen, with the patient on the other side of the screen, so that the physician can see the internal structure in motion, allowing for a more refined image and a more accurate assessment and diagnosis. Your veterinarian may also take a tissue sample from the inside of the trachea for laboratory testing. This sample will be used to grow the bacteria in the tissue in order to determine if there is any harmful bacteria present in the tracheal tube, and conduct culture testing to see the types of cells that are present in the sample. In order to grade the severity of the collapse, another technique called bronchoscopy can also be used. In this procedure, the bronchoscope, a tubular instrument with a camera attached, is threaded into the trachea and the images are retrieved and relayed onto video equipment where they can be reviewed and assessed in the process of making the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is a more invasive method than the standard X-rays, but it can give a much more detailed view of the various abnormalities present in the tracheal tube, including foreign bodies, bleeding, inflammation, or tumors inside the airways. Bronchoscopy can also allow for estimating the degree of narrowing in the trachea, which may range from a grade-1 to grade-6 degree, measured on the basis of increasing severity. The bronchoscope can even be used to collect tissue and fluid samples from deeper within the tracheal canal for laboratory testing. Hospitalization will be required if your dog is having severe symptoms and is not able to breathe properly. To compensate for respiratory problems oxygen therapy is administered. It is also typical to heavily sedate cats with a collapsed trachea. This is so that they are not suffering, but also so that they are not fighting against the physical restrictions caused by the disease and against the treatments that are being used. Activity needs to be kept as minimal as possible until the cat has stabilized. There are several drugs that can be used in the treatment of tracheal collapse. Cough suppressant medication can be used to minimize the stress related to the continuous coughing that is commonly associated with tracheal collapse, and your veterinarian will also give medication to dilate the small airways to facilitate normal breathing. Other drugs for reducing inflammation in the trachea will also be started to reduce the symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be required, especially if obstruction is a problem. However, complications are common in these patients after surgery. Though complete rest is recommended for these patients during recovery, gently exercise and adherence to a healthy diet is highly advised for reducing weight on a long-term basis. Weight reduction plays an important role in relieving symptoms, and most cats respond well to a well planned weight reduction program. Talk to your veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist about a weight-loss program that is best suited to your cat's weight, age, health condition and breed. Overexcitement is discouraged in these animals, as it may precipitate a crisis for their already compromised lung function. Gentle exercise is best, so you will need keep your cat indoors as much as possible, but still provide enough space for the cat to move freely so that it is getting a sufficient amount of physical exercise. The prognosis for remission from the disease is good if proper treatment and weight loss can be achieved. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pulmonary_edema_noncardiogenic,Collection of Fluid in the Lungs (Not Due to Heart Disease) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Noncardiogenic edema is caused by an increased permeability (or the ability to pass through, as by osmosis) of the blood vessels of the lungs. This increased permeability results in the leakage of fluid into the lung, causing edema, or swelling. This increased permeability results in the leakage of fluid into the lung, causing edema, or swelling. When this becomes severe, the edema may be accompanied by an inflammatory response and an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung. There are several factors which can cause changes in the permeability of the lung’s blood vessels. Cats that have edema as a result of brain disorder, electric cord bite , or upper airway obstruction might experience a systemic release of catecholamines (neurotransmitters and hormones). This release would lead to a causative effect, with systemic constriction of blood vessels shunting blood into the lungs and overloading the blood vessels of the lung, damaging them, and leading to inflammation and swelling of the lungs. Manifestation of a generalized inflammatory response in the lungs develops in patients with a bacterial infection of the blood, or with pancreatitis , and will often worsen over the 24 hours following the initial episode. The most seriously affected patients may progress from apparently normal health to a fatal condition only hours after the incident. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are causing secondary symptoms. He or she will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Arterial blood gas measurement, and pulse oximetry will also be performed, along with coagulation testing (to determine whether the blood is clotting normally). Radiograph images of the thoracic (chest) cavity are also essential for making a definitive diagnosis. An echocardiogram may also be performed to rule out, or confirm, pulmonary (lung) edema caused by heart disease. If your cat is experiencing severe respiratory dysfunction it will be hospitalized until its breathing has stabilized. If your cat is affected with a moderate to severe form of the disease it will be given oxygen therapy and cage rest in a quiet environment to minimize stress, since anything that can bring on anxiety for the cat will cause the production of stress hormones. If your cat is having too much of a problem breathing on its own it may be put on a mechanical respirator until it is able to breath normally again. Often, cats with noncardiogenic edema will worsen before improving. Cats that have progressed to a severely form of pulmonary edema tend to have a poor prognosis. However, mild to moderately ill patients stand a good chance of full recovery, and the long-term prognosis is excellent for recovered patients. One of the ways you can prevent noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in your cat includes preventing it from chewing on electrical wires. Another way is to get immediate veterinary treatment for your cat at the first sign of seizures. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_colitis_histiocytic_ulcerative,Colonic Ulcer in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Histiocytes are large white blood cells that reside in the normal connective tissue, where they ingest infectious microorganisms and foreign particles. They are an essential component of the immune system. Histiocytic ulcerative colitis is an uncommon disease characterized by ulcers in the lining of the colon, and inflammation with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive histiocytes. The origin and pathogenic mechanism for this disorder is unknown; however, an infectious cause is assumed. Histiocytic ulcerative colitis may also have a possible genetic basis, but the cause is unknown. This is a rare condition in cats. There is no known cause or predisposing factors. Your veterinarian will need to rule out other causes for the colitis. there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Causes that will be confirmed or ruled out in this process include nonhistiocytic IBD, infectious colitis, parasitic colitis, and allergic colitis. Other diagnoses that may become apparent include cecal inversion, where the first portion of the large bowel is turned in on itself; ileocolic intussusception, where one part of the bowel passes into the next one; neoplasia, such as lymphoma or adenocarcinoma - a type of cancer that originates in a gland; a foreign body; rectocolonic polyps; and irritable bowel syndrome. Differentiation can be made by examination of fecal flotations, direct smears, bacterial culture for pathogens, abdominal imaging, and colonoscopy with biopsy. A colonoscopy of the intestines may reveal patchy red foci (pinpoint ulcerations), overt ulceration, thick mucosal folds, areas of granulation tissue, or narrowing of the intestine. Multiple biopsy specimens will need to be taken to obtain a diagnosis. Your cat's outpatient medical management will include changing its diet to include moderately fermentable fiber supplementation. Your veterinarian will advise you of the possibility of progressive disease and recurrence and may prescribe antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory drugs. Clinical signs and body weight should be monitored every week to two weeks initially. Depending on the outcome, your cat may need ongoing antibiotic therapy. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrial_septal_defect,Congenital Heart Defect (Atrial Septal Defect) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial ASD, also known as atrial septal defect, is a congenital heart anomaly that enables blood flow between the left and right atria via the interatrial septum (the separating wall). Typically, the blood will shunt into the right atrium, causing a volume overload to the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary vasculature, which can sometimes lead to pulmonary hypertension. However, if right-sided pressures are too high, shunting may occur right to left, causing generalized cyanosis. ASD is more common in cats (9 percent of congenital heart defects) than dogs (0.7 percent), though a recent study from France suggests a higher incidence, with ASD accounting for 37.7 percent of congenital cardiac defects in pooled data from dogs and cats. ASD occurs in one of three locations: lower atrial septum (ostium primum defect, which is the most common), near the fossa ovalis (ostium secundum defect), or craniodorsal to the fossa ovalis (sinus venous defect). Common signs associated with ASD include: The underlying cause of atrial septal defect is currently unknown. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel. X-rays and electrocardiograms will typically show right-sided heart and lung vessel enlargement in patients with large defects, while an echocardiogram may reveal right atrial and right ventricular dilation and the actual hole (a septal dropout). Arrhythmias and intraventricular conduction disturbances may also be visible using these diagnostic procedures. To document the blood flow through the hole and high ejection velocity through the pulmonary artery, doppler echocardiography is useful. Cats with congestive heart failure should be hospitalized until they are stable. Open heart surgery may be necessary to repair the defect, but this is often very expensive. Consult with your veterinarian the best and most affordable course of treatment for you and your pet. For some secundum-type defects, an amplatzer device may be implanted to close the hole. The prognosis in cats with ASD depends on the size of the defect and coexisting abnormalities, though it is often guarded to poor. Small, isolated defects, for example, are unlikely to progress, while primum-type defects are typically larger with a worse prognosis. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_ebstein_anomaly,Congenital Heart Defect (Ebstein’s Anomaly) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital malformation of the heart in which the opening of the tricuspid valve (on the right side of the heart, between the right atrium and the right ventricle) is displaced toward the apex of the right ventricle of the heart. It is accompanied by various degrees of tricuspid insufficiency, such as stenosis – an abnormal narrowing in a blood vessel, or rapid heart rhythms caused by an abnormal accessory pathway. A murmur can be detected with a stethoscope in young animals, though it can be much more difficult to hear irregular heart movements if there is stenosis. There is no breed or gender predilection toward this abnormality in cats. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. Your veterinarian will order an x-ray of the chest, and will look for evidence of right atrial and ventricular enlargement, as well as an enlarged kidney. Echocardiography can also be used to examine the heart and chest, by showing an ultrasound image of the size, motion and composition of the heart and surrounding structure. An electrocardiogram to measure the electrical activity and pressure within the heart will be necessary for verifying a definitive diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly. There is no cure for Ebstein's anomaly, so medical management is the only practical approach available. Surgical replacement of the tricuspid valve can be successfully performed at some institutions. Your veterinarian can counsel you on the potential benefits of such an operation, and where you can go for medical care. If right heart failure develops sodium intake will need to be reduced. There are some medications for treating this disease, you will need to work closely with your veterinarian to work out a treatment and medication plan that is appropriate for your cat. Your veterinarian will set up a schedule for monitoring your cat's progress. As part of the ongoing after care, echocardiogram images will need to be taken from time to time to measure your cat's condition and to adjust treatment methods accordingly, and activity will be encouraged for strengthening the heart. Your veterinarian can advise you on what activities will be best for your cat. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_pulmonic_stenosis,Congenital Heart Defect (Pulmonic Stenosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pulmonic stenosis is a congenital (present at birth) defect characterized by the narrowing and obstruction of blood through the heart's pulmonary valve, which connects the right ventricle (one of the heart's four chambers) to the pulmonary artery. Depending on the severity of the obstruction, it can cause anything from a murmur to an arrhythmia to congestive heart failure. However, it is rather uncommon in cats, especially as an isolated defect. There are three types of pulmonic stenosis: valvular pulmonic stenosis (occurring in the valve), subvalvular pulmonic stenosis (occurring below the valve, and supravalvular pulmonic stenosis (just inside the pulmonary artery). Valvular pulmonic stenosis is the most common form seen in cats. If the stenosis is mild, no clinical symptoms may be present, whereas severely affected patients may collapse with exertion or suffer from congestive heart failure (CHF). Other visible signs of pulmonic stenosis include: Congenital (present at birth). You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal. Some cats may also be revealed to have polycthemia, a condition which causes an abnormally high number of red blood cells. Other diagnositc procedures include thoracic X-rays (which may show heart enlargement), abdominal X-rays (which may show abnormal accumulation fluid in abdominal cavity ( ascites ), and echocardiography (which may show increase in size of right ventricle and other abnormalities related to ventricle). A more advanced version of echocardiography, Doppler Echocardiography, may be used to measure the speed of blood flow. Angiography, on the other hand, is an imaging technique used to visualize the inside of blood vessels and heart chambers, which can help identify the precise structural abnormalities before surgery. The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the severity of the valve obstruction. If the cat undergoes congestive heart failure (CHF), it will require immediate hospitalization. Balloon catheter dilation is relatively safe and common procedure that involves passing a catheter at the site of obstruction and inflating a balloon to dilate the obstruction. A more advanced surgical technique involves incising the obstructed cardiac valve to relieve the obstruction (valvuloplasty). However, the prevalence of complications and mortalities are much higher with this technique as compared to performing a balloon catheter dilation. If long-term treatment is required, you must follow all the veterinarian's instructions and administer medication at the proper dosage and time. The cat will also need to rest in a stress-free environment -- away from children, pets, and noise -- to avoid putting undue stress on the heart. Diet restrictions often involve restricting foods with high salt content. Cats with a mild form of pulmonic stenosis can life a normal lifespan, whereas patients with moderate and severe forms of the disorder have a more guarded prognosis, especially if congestive heart failure (CHF) has developed. In addition, due to the genetic nature of this disorder, your veterinarian will typically recommend against breeding cats with pulmonic stenosis. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/heart-failure-cats,Congestive Heart Failure in Cats,"ilkermetinkursova/E+ via Getty Images Is your cat struggling to breathe? They may be suffering from congestive heart failure. If your cat’s heart can’t pump blood out to the rest of the body efficiently, they may start to accumulate fluid in their lungs. This can make it difficult for them to get adequate oxygen and put them at risk for a stroke. Congestive heart failure in cats is a progressive condition in which the heart muscle is too weak to meet the body’s demands. To understand heart failure in cats, it’s important to know how the heart muscle works and what it does for your cat's body. The heart pumps blood to various parts of the body such as the lungs, brain, kidneys, and limbs. The blood provides oxygen and other nutrients to body tissues. Blood circulation also helps to release waste from tissues by removing carbon dioxide. When the heart is not functioning properly, it can affect every organ and muscle in the body. When heart failure in cats occurs, a feline’s heart has difficulty bringing enough oxygen to tissue and is slow in removing waste. This results in fluid congestion as the blood is failing to be pumped out of the heart efficiently. Fluid then backs up and accumulates in the lungs or body. When congestive heart failure is not treated, heart function declines. This results in decreased oxygen to the body that’s necessary for life. Cats can experience cardiogenic shock where their blood pressure drops; their pulse becomes weak and they experience life-threatening hypoxia (low oxygen). If left untreated, congestive heart failure in cats can be fatal. Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Heart failure in cats usually starts as a progression of heart disease , with few symptoms to even suggest your cat is sick. Cats can play, eat normally, and have normal bowel movements early in heart disease. As heart disease advances, pet parents may start to notice symptoms. The most common include: Difficulty breathing or panting Lethargy Lack of appetite Coughing If your cat is experiencing any symptoms of heart disease or failure, take them to a veterinarian immediately. If your cat appears to be healthy, a full physical exam is recommended annually with your veterinarian to detect early signs. Heart disease often has very few signs early on. It’s best if you can catch underlying heart disease before your cat goes into congestive heart failure. The best way to catch heart disease early is to have your vet listen to your cat's heart with a stethoscope every year to ensure they have developed no new murmurs (abnormal heart sound) or arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythm). Your cat can be screened early for any stretch or wear on the heart muscle with a blood test called a cardiopet proBNP. This test measures a protein that is released when the heart muscle is stressed and can be helpful in catching heart disease early. Watch your cat for any signs of exercise intolerance. If athletic things that used to be easy seem to wear your cat out, it could be a sign of early heart disease. It is also helpful to have an idea of what their resting respiratory rate runs. To get this number, count the number of times your cat’s chest rises when they’re awake and calm. This number should be under 30. If it’s creeping up, this may indicate early congestive heart failure. Signs of end-stage heart failure are usually much less subtle. Affected cats are struggling to get oxygen in their bodies. They will likely look like they’re working hard to breathe. They may breathe rapidly or even experience open-mouth breathing. Your cat's gums may look less pink and appear more blue or purple-tinged if they are in end-stage heart failure. Most affected cats have very little energy and are reluctant to move around. They may not lay down or cozy up in their beds like they used to. Lying on their side leads to pooling of fluid on one side of their lungs and makes it even harder to breathe. Occasionally, affected cats will cough. This is much more common in dogs with congestive heart failure than in cats with congested heart failure. Congestive heart disease in cats can be caused by: Birth defects, like patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or septal defects inside the heart Underlying heart disease, like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) Infections, like endocarditis Other underlying medical conditions, like untreated hyperthyroidism or hypertension Changes in the anatomy of the heart that sometimes come with aging Genetics, with some cat breeds—like Maine Coons , Persians , and Ragdolls —at a higher risk To diagnose congestive heart failure in cats, a physical exam by your veterinarian may be the only way to tell that something’s wrong. Your vet may notice that your cat's heart sounds abnormal when listening with a stethoscope. The cat may have a heart murmur , which lets the veterinarian know that there’s blood moving through the heart in an abnormal direction. Blood should flow into the heart via just one entrance and out through one exit. If blood is allowed to move back in the opposite direction, it will cause a distinctive swishing sound. During a physical exam, your veterinarian may also determine if your cat’s heart is beating too fast, too slowly, or with an irregular rhythm ( cardiac arrhythmia ). To diagnose a problem with the heart, your veterinarian will likely want to do several tests including: Blood work . This will test the function of most of the organs, including the thyroid and kidneys. Chest radiographs ( X-rays) . X-rays will let the vet check the heart size and the condition of the lungs. This is important, since the lungs and heart work closely together. Blood pressure . This is to make sure your cat does not need to be treated for hypertension. Hypertension can come from heart disease, but it can also contribute to heart disease. An ultrasound of the heart . This is called an echocardiogram, which allows the vet to see what may be causing an abnormal sound and measures how the heart is working. None of the tests are invasive or painful, although some anxious cats may be more comfortable with sedation . Some cats with severe symptoms may require supplemental oxygen during testing. Some of these tests can be easily done with your local veterinarian, while others may need a veterinary cardiologist to fully diagnose the problem. Once congestive heart failure in cats has been diagnosed, medications (like furosemide ) may be used to help the heart function better, normalize the rhythm, or reduce blood pressure. Most of these medications can increase quality and quantity of life. Diuretics, also called “water pills”, are an important part of congestive heart failure treatment. These medications work to help pull fluid off the lungs so that your cat can breathe easier. The most prescribed diuretics in cats are furosemide and spironolactone . Affected cats will often be prescribed an ace-inhibitor. This type of medication helps the vessels relax and widen so it’s easier for the heart to pump blood out to the body. Enalapril and benazepril are common examples of these medications used in cats. Cats that have heart disease are at an increased risk of having a stroke . Because of this, many cats with congestive heart failure will also be prescribed medication, like clopidogrel , to reduce their stroke risk. If your cat also has hypertension, they may be prescribed a blood pressure medication, like amlodipine . Your cat’s cardiologist may prescribe additional medications depending on what they appreciate on your cat’s EKG and echocardiogram. With regular medication, you can help your cat breathe easier and live a more comfortable life after a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Medications are used to control quality of life in cases of congestive heart failure in cats. They are usually effective with proper patient monitoring. Your veterinarian will likely want to perform blood work frequently when medications are first started to ensure your cat has the proper dose. This will also help the vet know how well your cat is tolerating the medications. Watch for any changes in behaviors or eating habits. Share any side effects that you notice at home with your vet. Watch for any decreased appetite, weight loss or poor energy. Let your vet know right away if your cat’s getting worse instead of better. Your vet may teach you how to monitor the respiratory rate at home and may ask for frequent checkups so they can listen to your cat’s heart. A veterinary diet , like Hills Multiorgan Complex Support , may be recommended so that your cat is eating what is best for this condition. Once the heart failure is under control, a cat will likely need to be on medication for the rest of their life, with annual monitoring by their vet. If your cat has other medical conditions such as kidney disease , hypertension, or pulmonary disease, it can make treating the heart failure more complicated. Many pets can recover from congestive heart failure in cats, but they must be in treatment for life. The prognosis for congestive heart failure is guarded in cats. While some cats can live several years after a diagnosis, the average life expectancy for affected cats is six to 12 months. The average cat will live six to 12 months after being diagnosed with congestive heart failure; however, some cats can live for several years beyond the average. Euthanasia is a humane option for cats that can’t breathe comfortably even with medications. A diet that is low in sodium and rich in heart healthy ingredients like omega-3 fatty acids , carnitine and taurine. Early recognition of heart disease and management is the best way to prevent your cat from going into congestive heart failure. This can be done with regular checkups with your cat’s veterinarian and heart screening with diagnostics, like X-rays, ultrasound and cardiopet proBNP testing.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_conjunctivitis,Conjunctivitis in Cats (Cat Pink Eye),"Remains/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images If your cat has swollen pink eyes with lots of drainage, they could be suffering from conjunctivitis. Conjunctivitis in cats is common, especially in young cats that were recently adopted. While cat eye infections can look nasty, with good care and time, they often respond well to treatment. Conjunctivitis in cats is inflammation of a feline’s conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is the mucous membrane that lines the upper and lower eyelids (a cat’s third eyelid), and their eyeball. Click here to download this medical illustration. Conjunctivitis in cats often occurs acutely (as a short-term condition) and is painful . It’s one of the most common cat eye diseases . Symptoms of conjunctivitis in cats can range from mild redness around the eyes to much more severe signs. You may notice the following in your cat: The conjunctival tissues are inflamed and swollen, causing excessive blinking, squinting, and the inability to fully open and close the eye. There may be clear discharge, mucous, or bloody material coming from the eye. The eyes and the skin around them may be itchy or losing hair . In addition to seeing symptoms in your cat’s eyes, it’s also common to see signs of an upper respiratory infection (URI) . These include: Sneezing Nasal discharge (clear or thick mucus) Decreased appetite Lack of energy or lethargy There are several potential causes for conjunctivitis in cats. Let’s look at some of the most common reasons why a cat may develop conjunctivitis. Most cases of conjunctivitis in cats are viral. Viral conjunctivitis may be caused by: Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) . This is the most common cause of conjunctivitis, especially chronic or recurrent cases. The virus hides in the nervous system and activates at times of stress or illness. FHV-1 is like human herpesvirus-1, but this family of viruses is species-specific, so FHV-1 cannot infect humans. However, it’s highly contagious to other cats in close contact. Calicivirus . This is another common virus. It’s primarily shed in nose, eye, and mouth secretions, though it can be found in other body fluids. It’s also spread via close contact. While many cats recover, others will become lifelong carriers. Cats with viral conjunctivitis may experience a secondary bacterial infection. However, bacteria can be the primary pathogen as well (bacterial conjunctivitis), although bacterial conjunctivitis is less common than viral. The most common pathogens are: Chlamydophila felis (C. felis) Mycoplasma Staphylococcus Streptococcus Bartonella Pseudomonas species C. felis can cross species, although this is not common, humans (particularly those with compromised immune systems) can catch it from infected cats. Outdoor cats are more prone to parasitic infections, which usually cause more systemic disease but can also cause conjunctivitis (parasitic conjunctivitis). These include: Leishmaniasis Thelaziasis Onchocerciasis Humans may be susceptible to all three of these, but direct transmission is rare. It’s important to be aware of any possible cross-species potential and talk to human-health professionals about any concerns. This uncommon cause of conjunctivitis involves a cat’s immune system attacking itself. Eosinophilic conjunctivitis is idiopathic in origin, meaning veterinarians don’t know why it occurs. However, it may have a link to FHV-1. It causes an infiltration of a certain type of white blood cell to the conjunctiva, causing the inflammation. Lipogranulomatous conjunctivitis occurs when lipids (fats) are deposited along the eyelid margin, glands, and ducts. Veterinarians are uncertain of the cause of this disease. Allergies are a cause of conjunctivitis for many cats. They can come from food or environmental factors, such as: Dust Pollen Weeds Mites Fleas Physical irritants can range from foreign bodies like grass, sticks, or eyelashes, to harder-to-diagnose irritants like dust, chemicals, smoke , and eye ointments. Ocular diseases such as ulcers , glaucoma , eye tumors , or eyelid malformations—can cause secondary conjunctivitis. Eyelid diseases such as abnormal eyelid anatomy or cancer —involve frictional irritation or exposure and may cause conjunctivitis. To diagnose conjunctivitis in cats, a vet will conduct a complete ophthalmic examination, including: A careful eye exam using special instruments and stains to look for other diseases in the eye. A Schirmer tear test is used to assess your cat’s natural tear production by determining the number of tears produced. A fluorescein stain test, which is critical to diagnose corneal ulcers. A test of intraocular pressures to look for inflammation or glaucoma. Blood tests specifically looking for two viruses: feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus . Cats with either virus are immunocompromised and therefore more susceptible to infections. Blood tests to look for signs of infection and overall organ function. Radiographs ( X-rays ) to assess lung pathology, as cats with conjunctivitis frequently have respiratory infections. Additional tests may include PCR, virus isolation, immunofluorescence antibody testing, and serology to test for other specific bacterial and viral infections. The goal of treatment for conjunctivitis in cats is eliminating the pain and the infection, as well as treating the underlying cause, if there is one. Topical eye drops or ointment may be prescribed, along with topical medications for inflammation and pain. If your cat has infectious conjunctivitis, they may be prescribed an eye medication that has an antibiotic in it, like terramycin or tobramycin . Sometimes, combination antibiotic and anti-inflammatory eye drops are prescribed, like NeoPolyDex drops. When needed, immune-suppressive drugs are prescribed for immune-mediated cases. Medications like prednisone acetate or tacrolimus may be recommended in cats affected by eosinophilic keratoconjunctivitis. Your veterinarian will go over the proper application of all eye medications, as great care is necessary to avoid further damage to your cat’s eye. If your cat is suffering from viral conjunctivitis and severe herpes, they may be prescribed an oral anti-viral medication, like famciclovir . Any other infections will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Most cases of simple conjunctivitis in cats resolve relatively smoothly with seven to 10 days of topical therapy. Longer treatment is warranted for certain infectious agents, and for immune-mediated cases. When complications arise, such as corneal ulceration or sequestration , outpatient surgery may be necessary. A common cause of conjunctivitis in cats from both rescue and breeder backgrounds is herpesvirus. Herpes infections are sporadic and often first show up during kittenhood. Many cats are infected with FHV-1 and do not show any signs of clinical illness. In most cases, herpesvirus conjunctivitis is self-limiting and will resolve within two weeks, though the conjunctivitis should still be treated. With cases of herpesvirus conjunctivitis, the signs often appear suddenly and are especially common after stressful situations such as travel, boarding, surgery, or illness. When cats do have a flare-up, they are more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, which can be concerning for young kittens. Introducing probiotics and maintaining a stress-free environment for your cat can help to prevent viral conjunctivitis flare-ups in cats. Some products your vet may recommend include: Fortiflora is a probiotic product made by Purina, which can decrease the severity of herpes conjunctivitis by utilizing “good” bacteria in the body. VetriScience Lysine Plus Lysine is an amino acid that supports the immune and respiratory system in cats. Hyaluronate-containing tear ointments or supplements , like OphtHAvet Ophthalmic Solution Eye Lubrican , can provide lubrication and support overall proper health of the eye’s tear and glands. Healthy tear films will better clear and manage infections—and the inflammatory issues associated with them. Good environmental hygiene, a low number of cats in the home, decreased stress, and early veterinary intervention are also helpful in preventing conjunctivitis in cats. For multi-cat households, Feliway is an effective tool that utilizes pheromones to decrease stress, and therefore decrease the chances of the reappearance of viral conjunctivitis. A Thundershirt can help cats with anxiety by using calming, gentle pressure, similar to swaddling a baby. Prozac and similar prescription medications may be helpful for cats who suffer from more severe anxiety. While there is no cure for most causes of conjunctivitis in cats, there are many treatments and solutions to effectively manage the condition and allow cats to live a happy, healthy life.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_corneal_dystrophies,Corneal Disease (Inherited) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Corneal dystrophy is an inherited progressive condition which affects both eyes, often in the same way. The cornea, the clear outer layer of the front of the eye, is most affected. The disease is not associated with other diseases, and only rarely occurs in cats. There are three types of corneal dystrophy, categorized by location: epithelial corneal dystrophy, where cell formation is affected; stromal corneal dystrophy, where the cornea will become cloudy; and endothelial corneal dystrophy, where the cells of the lining of the cornea are affected. Epithelial corneal dystrophy: Stromal corneal dystrophy: Endothelial corneal dystrophy: Cats breeds that are predisposed: Epithelial Stromal Endothelial Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including an ophthalmic exam. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Slit lamp microscopy will aid significantly in differentiating the type of corneal dystrophy present, and a fluorescein stain, a non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light, will be used to examine the eye for abrasions, and to define the shape of the cornea so that your veterinarian can diagnose the corneal dystrophy. Fluorescein dye enables visualization of any corneal ulcers that may be present; these types of ulcers occur with endothelial and epithelial corneal dystrophy. Fluorescein dye is inconsistent in its ability to aid in diagnosis of endothelial corneal dystrophy, and is not of much use in the diagnosis of stromal corneal dystrophy, but it can be helpful in the diagnosis of epithelial corneal dystrophy. A tonometer will be used to measure the interior pressure in your cat’s eyes so as to rule out glaucoma as a possible cause of corneal swelling. If your cat has corneal ulcers, they will treated with antibiotic eye medications. Stromal corneal dystrophy usually does not require treatment. Endothelial corneal dystrophy may be treated using contact lenses over your cat's eyes. Also, epithelial corneal tags may be removed. Another possible treatment for endothelial corneal dystrophy is flap surgery of the conjunctiva (the lining of the eyeball and the back surface of the lids). While a corneal transplant may be beneficial, results are inconsistent. Your cat will probably always have some cloudiness to its eyes after treatment. However, if you notice that your cat is in pain due to its eyes (e.g., blinking, watering of the eyes) contact your veterinarian, as ulcers may be developing on the cornea. This is prevalent with endothelial and epithelial corneal dystrophy. Your cat’s vision will most probably remain normal despite corneal dystrophy. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_corneal_ulcers,Corneal Ulcers in Cats,"The cornea is the clear outer membrane that protects the front of the eyeball. It is made up of three layers that are all transparent. When one or more of these layers is damaged structurally, such as a hole or a scratch, it’s known as a corneal ulcer. It can also be called a corneal abrasion or erosion. There are varying levels of severity with corneal ulcers in cats, classified to their depths and severity. Click here to download this medical illustration. Corneal ulcers in cats are very painful. Symptoms and signs of a cat corneal ulcer include: Rubbing the affected eye with their paw or against furniture or the floor Redness (can be difficult to notice because they will keep their eye squinted) Squinting/tightly shutting their eye Eye discharge may or may not be present Trauma in one form or another is the cause of most corneal ulcers. Trauma can look like a foreign body in the eye, or it can be something much more innocuous. Tear-production conditions and eyelid abnormalities can also be responsible for corneal ulcers in cats. After the veterinarian’s physical exam and close ophthalmic and neurological exams, the veterinarian will conduct a few tests for the eye. One test measures tear production, called a Schirmer tear test. The intraocular pressure will also be checked. Tear test breakup team (the rate which the tear film evaporates) may also be checked. The fluorescein dye application (a fluorescent dye) will be the most effective test at your vet visit when a corneal ulcer is to be blamed for your cat’s squinting eye. With this test, a special dye will be applied, taken up by certain layers of the cornea, and gently flushed out. The veterinarian will then be able to see if any dye remains as it glows neon green. They will likely be happy to show you the bright green glow, so you can see the corneal scar with your own eyes. For complex ulcers, advanced samples may be needed for examination. The goal of treatment is to stop the loss of the corneal cells and prevent the cornea from further rupturing. Eliminating pain is also a cornerstone of treatment. Other therapies are aimed at encouraging the cornea to repopulate the damaged cells while minimizing scarring. The topical application of the cat’s own serum (this will be prepared in-house just for your cat) is often helpful to encourage healing. Any concurrent infection must also be treated. The application of medications will be several times a day in all likelihood. If the ulcer is complex, surgery may be recommended to promote healing. Many of these procedures can be done by your primary care veterinarian. If the ulcer exceeds 50% or more of the depth of the cornea, or if the ulcer is nonresponsive to treatment, referral to a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist is recommended. Surgery may be necessary. Rechecks for corneal ulcers in cats are crucial; if a simple corneal ulcer is not improving in five days, it becomes classified as a complex ulcer, and treatment must ramp up accordingly. Because this is such a short time frame, your veterinarian will likely want to do the first recheck before this period is over. A recheck within two to three days is not uncommon to ensure the ulcer is improving. No. Without treatment, corneal ulcers are at risk for rapidly worsening, and they can “melt” away the affected part of the cornea. Depending upon severity, one to eight weeks after being treated by a vet. They will not heal on their own. Your cat will have a reddened, painful eye and will be squinting or rubbing at their eye.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_cryptococcosis,Cryptococcosis in Cats,"Cryptococcosis is a type of fungal infection that occurs when a cat inhales spores from a type of fungus that grows in organic material such as soil, decaying wood, or bird guano (especially droppings from pigeons). Spores also can enter the skin through an open wound. This infection is caused by either Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii . Cryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection in cats and can spread throughout the body. Once infected, spores can spread to the respiratory tract (nasal cavity), central nervous system, eyes, and skin (mostly over the face and neck). C. neoformans is found worldwide while C. gattii is native to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and Central and South America. Because cats typically inhale the spores through their nose, upper respiratory symptoms are the most common: Sneezing Hard swelling over the bridge of the nose Polyps in the nasal passages, which may cause difficulty breathing Nasal discharge that may be blood-tinged, yellow, clear, or a combination of mucus and pus Less often, the fungus may infect the lungs and cause coughing and rapid labored breathing. Skin lesions are also commonly seen on cats with this fungal disease, appearing as nodules or papules that can be fluid-filled or firm. Sometimes large ulcers that may drain fluid appear on the skin. A cat's central nervous system (CNS) may also be affected by the fungal organism, which may lead to the following symptoms: Depression Behavioral changes Walking in circles Seizures Muscular weakness Dilated pupils, even when light is directed at the eyes (which may progress to blindness) Cryptococcosis is caused by spores inhaled from Cryptococcus fungus that can grow in soil, decaying wood, and bird guano (excrement). The spores usually enter the nasal cavity and can spread to the lungs by growing into the surrounding tissues. The spores can then enter the bloodstream and invade other parts of the body, such as the skin, eyes, central nervous system, lymph nodes, urinary tract, spleen, GI tract, or pancreas. When cryptococcosis spreads throughout a cat's body, this is referred to as a systemic fungal disease. Multiple organs can be harmed and symptoms can vary based on which organ or organs are affected. There are different ways to test for cryptococcosis: Once a cat is diagnosed with cryptococcosis, a veterinarian will prescribe anti-fungal medication. The type of medication that is prescribed will depend upon the severity of the infection. AMB is a very effective anti-fungal medication for treating cryptococcosis and it also helps to stimulate a cat's immune system to also fight the infection. Cats undergoing treatment for cryptococcosis need to be rechecked by a veterinarian monthly. They also may need bloodwork and urine tests done periodically to monitor kidney or liver function, depending upon which treatment is prescribed. Recovery time varies based on the treatment prescribed. For mild to moderate infections, it can take 4 months with fluconazole or 9 months with itraconazole. For severe cases that involve the central nervous system, amphotericin B and flucytosine are prescribed, but these cases generally have a poor prognosis because the infection is widespread. The length of treatment is based on cryptococcosis titers (concentrations of antigens). When the titer reaches zero, treatment is discontinued and then titers are done every 3-6 months to check for a relapse of infection. If the titer is unchanged after 2 months of treatment a different treatment plan is prescribed. Cats generally have a good prognosis if they do not have central nervous system involvement. Between 15% and 20% of cats can have a relapse of infection and need to be treated again. The best way to reduce risk for infection is to keep cats away from pigeon roosting areas and ideally keep them strictly indoors to reduce the risk for them to breathe in spores from Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii . Yes, it can be if the infection is treated quickly, and it does not cause neurologic involvement. Some cats can relapse and need to be treated again for cryptococcosis. No, humans cannot contract cryptococcosis from cats . Potentially, yes. If a Cryptococcus species penetrates a cat's central nervous system or affects multiple organs, then cryptococcosis can be fatal. No cats cannot transmit cryptococcosis to other cats. The spores of the fungus must be inhaled from the environment. Sykes J. American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine. Epidemiology of Cryptococcus Infections . November 2010. Takeuchi A.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/cushings-disease-hyperadrenocorticism-cats,Cushing's Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism) in Cats,"Hyperadrenocorticism is commonly referred to as Cushing’s disease. It is uncommon in cats, caused by an excessive production of the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is naturally released from the adrenal glands in stressful or fearful situations, and is often referred to as the “stress hormone.” The two adrenal glands are located in the abdomen, near each kidney. Excessive cortisol concentrations can cause a variety of changes, including: Excessive drinking Excessive urination Increased appetite Recurrent urinary tract infections Enlargement of the abdomen (a “potbellied-pig” appearance) Lethargy Muscle wasting and weakness Hair loss Curling of the ear tips Thin and fragile skin that easily tears Bruising Hyperadrenocorticism is caused by high doses of cortisol-like hormones over a long period of time. Usually, these steroids (for example, prednisone) are used to control chronic conditions like allergies and asthma. Cats are less prone to developing the adverse effects of steroids, so this presentation of hyperadrenocorticism is rare. Naturally occurring excessive levels of cortisol are also uncommon in cats. This condition is diagnosed in middle-aged and older cats (5–17 years old). Female cats are affected more than males, and domestic short- and longhaired cats more than purebreds. Cats with hyperadrenocorticism may also have diabetes mellitus . The excessive cortisol from the adrenal glands interferes with the effects of insulin, causing diabetes. In fact, hyperadrenocorticism can make it difficult to regulate insulin dosages for a cat with diabetes. Since hyperadrenocorticism is uncommon in cats and does not have a single “direct” test, diagnosis requires repeat blood tests, urine tests, and diagnostic imaging, like x-rays or ultrasounds. Tests used in combination to make the diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism include: Baseline Lab Work: This blood test checks liver and kidney values for function and counts red and white blood cell numbers. This helps to rule out more common causes of the clinical signs, after which more specific tests for hyperadrenocorticism are conducted. Urine Cortisol Measurements: This screening test, performed on multiple urine samples, helps to rule out hyperadrenocorticism. High levels alone do not confirm a diagnosis, so further tests are required to support a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. ACTH-Stimulation Test: This blood test measures cortisol levels before and after an injection of ACTH, the adrenocorticotropic hormone. An injection of ACTH should cause the body to temporarily increase the production of cortisol, then decrease production once the body’s threshold has been met. Consistently high concentrations of cortisol in these samples usually confirm a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. Dexamethasone Suppression Test: This blood test measures cortisol levels before and after an injection of dexamethasone, a steroid. The injection should decrease the production of cortisol. High concentrations of cortisol (indicating a lack of suppression) in these samples usually confirm a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. Imaging: X-rays can show other changes to the liver and/or abdomen that may support a diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. An ultrasound helps to determine whether one or both adrenal glands are affected. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cat’s head may show a mass on the pituitary gland, which is responsible for the regulation of hormones from the adrenal glands. With hyperadrenocorticism, treatment involves a controlled gradual withdrawal of the steroid that is being administered. Alternative drugs will be started if still needed, based on the underlying disease the steroid was treating—for example, to manage allergies or asthma. With naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism, treatment options vary. Control of the abnormal cortisol levels is obtained by: Medications: Trilostane is best to suppress cortisol production from the adrenal glands. Tablets are given by mouth once or twice daily and are adjusted according to each cat’s response. Clinical signs may improve only minimally, even after the cortisol level is in a normal range. Surgery: An adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of an adrenal gland. If only one adrenal gland is affected, this may be a good treatment. A hypophysectomy is the surgical removal of the pituitary gland (the regulator of the adrenal glands). This is an extremely difficult surgery that carries very high risks and is provided by only a few specialists. Radiation: Radiation is best for pituitary gland tumors and cats with neurological signs such as stumbling, drooling, and seizures. Cats with hyperadrenocorticism who respond well to the removal of the offending steroid and receive alternate medications will have an improved quality of life. Naturally occurring hyperadrenocorticism does not have a cure, but it can be managed. Prognosis for cats with hyperadrenocorticism varies greatly and relies on their access and response to treatment. Most cats that can receive therapy have an improved quality of life. Cats with the successful removal of adrenal tumors, if present, have the longest survival times, although the surgery itself has a high complication rate. Although hyperadrenocorticism is a serious disease, with appropriate treatment a cat can respond well and may have many months or even years with an excellent quality of life. If the underlying cause is a tumor, the prognosis is worse. When untreated, hyperadrenocorticism can be fatal.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/cyanosis-cats,Cyanosis in Cats,"thodonal/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Cyanosis is relatively common in cats and causes discomfort. Cyanosis refers to the lack of oxygen in blood, which causes blue discoloration to the mucous membranes and skin. Hemoglobin is the part of the blood that normally carries oxygen to the tissues throughout the body. In cats with cyanosis, hemoglobin traveling through blood vessels is deprived of oxygen. Oxygenated blood is red in color and deoxygenated blood is blue, which is why cyanosis causes blue discoloration. Cyanosis is always a symptom of another underlying health issue, most commonly lung or heart disease , but a variety of health conditions can cause it. Certain congenital (present at birth) heart defects make the condition more likely, since blood can bypass the lungs where it would have received oxygen before it is sent elsewhere in the body. Toxins , blood clots, and low body temperature (hypothermia) are also possible causes of cyanosis in cats. Cyanosis in cats is a medical emergency that, if left untreated, is fatal. Cats experiencing cyanosis need immediate veterinary intervention to improve oxygenation of their blood and prevent serious damage to their organs. This condition typically has a poor prognosis, especially if the underlying cause is heart or lung disease. Symptoms of cyanosis in cats can result in several concerning symptoms, including: Blue discoloration of the skin, gums, lips, and other mucous membranes Increased respiratory rate Difficulty breathing Panting Coughing Weakness Restlessness Lethargy Exercise intolerance Collapse Any disease or condition that decreases oxygen in the blood has the potential to lead to cyanosis in cats. Some of the most common causes include: Congenital heart defect —Heart defects may not allow the body to receive enough oxygen. Examples of heart defects that may cause cyanosis in cats include patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defects, and atrial septal defects. Cyanosis due to congenital heart defects is most common in young cats. Toxin ingestion —When certain toxins are ingested, hemoglobin loses its ability to carry oxygen throughout the body, resulting in cyanosis. Acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is an example of a medication that is toxic to cats and can lead to cyanosis. Electrical shock —If a cat chews on an electrical cord , electrical shock may occur , leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and difficulty breathing. Trauma or inflammation —Anything that causes trauma or inflammation to the brain, lungs, or chest cavity can result in cyanosis due to the body’s inability to oxygenate the blood appropriately. Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome —Cats with a flat face have structural differences in their upper airways, such as a narrow trachea, which causes them to have poor oxygenation compared to other cats. Burmese , Persian , and Himalayan cats are predisposed to this condition. Saddle thrombus —When a blood clot gets trapped in a major blood vessel it can cut off circulation to the hind legs, resulting in bluish discoloration to the paw pads. Hypothermia —When a cat’s body temperature reaches dangerously low levels , blood vessels in the limbs constrict to allow more blood to reach vital organs, such as the heart and brain. As a result, the cat’s skin can turn blue in various areas, such as the lips and limbs. To diagnose cyanosis in cats, a veterinarian will conduct a physical exam, paying special attention to the color of the mucous membranes and skin, as well as assessing the heart and lungs. Pet parents should provide a detailed history, including when symptoms started, any pre-existing medical conditions, and a list of any medications the cat is taking. To measure the amount of oxygen in a cat’s blood, a veterinarian may complete the following tests: Pulse oximetry —This is a simple, noninvasive test where a special device is placed onto a cat’s ear or in between their paw pads to measure the oxygen in the blood. This number is normally at 100%. Cats with cyanosis have levels less than 90%. Arterial blood gas analysis —A sample of blood is taken from the cat’s artery and a machine identifies how much oxygen is present within the blood. Additional tests, such as imaging and bloodwork, can be done to diagnose the underlying cause of the cyanosis. Since cyanosis in cats results from another underlying condition, treatment focuses on management of the underlying condition first. Treatment varies greatly because of this. The most important treatment is oxygen therapy , which is administered at the veterinary hospital to improve oxygenation of the blood and alleviate any respiratory symptoms that may be present. Other treatments may include the following: Thoracentesis —If trauma has occurred, fluid may need to be removed from the chest cavity to allow the cat to breathe more effectively. Surgery —If the cat is diagnosed with a heart defect or a blood clot, surgery may be able to correct the problem and improve oxygenation within the blood. Toxin antidote —If toxin ingestion is suspected, specific medications can be given to counteract its effects. For example, n-acetylcysteine is used for treating acetaminophen toxicity in cats. Diuretics —Medications such as furosemide can be given to remove excess fluid from a cat’s lungs to allow for better oxygenation. Supplemental heat —Cats who have dangerously low body temperatures can be safely warmed at the veterinary hospital using warm blankets and intravenous fluids. Additional treatments may be recommended as deemed appropriate by the veterinarian. Most cats with cyanosis are hospitalized for supportive care. Recovery from cyanosis in cats depends on the underlying cause. For example, if severe heart or lung disease is present, the prognosis is poor and most cats succumb to cyanosis quickly. However, if a cat has ingested acetaminophen, early diagnosis and treatment with antidotes can provide a good prognosis in otherwise healthy cats. Cats who are sent home after being diagnosed and treated for cyanosis should be monitored closely. Pet parents should follow the veterinarian’s instructions for follow-up care and prescription medications carefully during recovery. Many causes of cyanosis in cats are not preventable. Certain conditions, such as congenital heart defects, can only be managed with medications or surgery depending on the severity. However, certain causes of cyanosis can be prevented. Keeping potential toxins safely out of reach and not allowing cats access to extension cords that can be chewed are important preventative measures. Overall, regular preventive veterinary care is most important for the health and well-being of cats. These checkups allow veterinarians to catch any health problems early on so that appropriate treatment can be started before they worsen in severity.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_cytauxzoonosis,Cytauxzoonosis in Cats,"Cytauxzoonosis is a tick-borne (transmitted by tick bites) parasitic disease caused by Cytauxzoon felis , a protozoal (single-celled) organism that infects the blood cells of cats. The parasite infects white blood cells in the immune system, causing cells to swell. The swollen cell then blocks or clogs blood vessels throughout the body, resulting in inflammation and damage to tissues and organs. A parasite can also infect red blood cells, resulting in anemia that further damages tissues and organs due to a lack of oxygen. Geographically, cytauxzoonosis has been reported in South America, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Within the United States, Cytauxzoon felis has been identified primarily in the Central, South-central, Southeastern, and mid-Atlantic regions. Cytauxzoonosis is most diagnosed from April to September, correlating with tick season. Cytauxzoonosis was first reported in the United States in 1976 and is considered an emergency disease. While it is still uncommon in domestic cats, it is reported to affect up to 79% of wild cats in endemic regions. Clinical signs of cytauxzoonosis in cats start off minor but can quickly progress to a life-threatening illness. Clinical signs typically become apparent 5 to 14 days after infection. Some common symptoms include: Fever (90 percent of cats with cytauxzoonosis will have a fever up to 106°F) Anorexia Vomiting Depression Lethargy Dehydration Weakness Paleness Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, and whites of the eyes) Abdominal pain (enlargement of liver or spleen) Enlarged lymph nodes Increased heart rate and/or respiratory rate Seizures Coma Cytauxzoon felis is spread through tick bites—most commonly the lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ) or the American dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ). It is commonly referred to as “bobcat fever” because the natural host is the bobcat ( Lynx rufus ). Most bobcats will not show any signs of illness but serve as asymptomatic carriers that infect the local tick population. The ticks go on to infect other members of the cat family, wild or domestic. Unfortunately, cytauxzoonosis can be deadly to most other types of cats. Cats cannot transmit cytauxzoonosis to each other but must be bitten by a tick for transmission to occur. Additionally, cats cannot acquire cytauxzoonosis from ingesting a tick; the tick must bite the cat. Cytauxzoonosis is limited to the cat family and cannot infect humans or dogs. Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical examination to assess for fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Providing your vet with a detailed history of travel and recent tick exposure can be useful when evaluating for cytauxzoonosis. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis may all be recommended for a baseline evaluation. Ultimately, the diagnosis will likely be made by identifying the parasitic organism under a microscope from a blood smear (a drop of blood on a slide) or fine-needle aspirate of affected organs (such as liver or spleen). Cytauxzoon felis will appear as a signet-ring-shaped body within the red blood cell. It can look similar to—and occasionally be confused with—other parasites such as Mycoplasma hemofelis or Babesia felis . Early in the course of the disease, the organism will not be visible in the blood, so repeating the test in 12 to 24 hours is recommended if cytauxzoonosis is suspected. For confirmation, polymerase chain reaction testing for the presence of the parasite Cytauxzoon felis can be performed on blood or tissue samples. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are needed for successful management of cytauxzoonosis. Without treatment, the death rate in domestic cats is nearly 100%, but this drops to around 40 percent with early, intensive therapy. Cats will need to be hospitalized for IV fluids to correct dehydration and any electrolyte abnormalities, as well as initiating supportive care treatments such as anti-nausea or pain medications, blood transfusions, and nutrition (including feeding tubes and appetite stimulants). The current treatment of choice for Cytauxzoon felis is antiprotozoal therapy with atovaquone and azithromycin, which has shown a 50-60% survival rate . Cytauxzoonosis is deadly in cats, and even with intensive care, only 60% will survive . Typically, those who succumb to the disease do so within the first 24 hours of admission to the ICU. Most cats will remain hospitalized for 7 to 10 days on IV fluids, supportive care, and the antiprotozoal protocol (Atovaquone/Azithromycin). Cats that survive will recover over the next two to three weeks and are expected to return to normal lives. Most cats that survive acute cytauxzoonosis will remain chronically infected, but clinically asymptomatic for life. They will not need to stay on medications but will never completely be clear of the Cytauxzoon felis infection. This makes them a natural reservoir source for tick transmission, similar to the natural host of the bobcat. Given the role of ticks in the transmission of cytauxzoonosis, monthly flea and tick prevention are highly recommended. If you live in an area of high prevalence of cytauxzoonosis, it is ideal to keep your cat indoors only to minimize exposure and risk. Cats with cytauxzoonosis will require hospitalization for IV fluids, supportive care, and a 10-day course of antiprotozoal protocol with Atovaquone and Azithromycin. Yes. Untreated cytauxzoonosis is typically always fatal in cats unless there is early medical intervention. Cytauxzoonosis is a parasitic disease caused by Cytauxzoon felis and spread through tick bites, most commonly the lone star tick ( Amblyomma americanum ) or the American dog tick ( Dermacentor variabilis ).

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_corneal_sequestrum,Dark Spots on the Eye in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Corneal sequestrum occurs when the cat has dead corneal tissue (or dark spots in the cornea). It usually is caused by chronic corneal ulceration, trauma, or corneal exposure. Corneal sequestrum can affect all breeds, but is more prone in Persian and Himalayan breeds. In cats, it usually begins during their middle-aged years. The dark spots in your cat's cornea may remain unchanged for long periods of time, and then suddenly get worse. Listed below are some other symptoms your cat may experience: The exact cause of the condition is unknown; however, the following is a list of potential risk factors: Treatment will depend on the lesion's depth and the degree of ocular pain for your cat. The blemish may spontaneously separate itself from the surrounding tissue (slough), so timing is important. If you decide to wait to proceed with treatment, supportive care is necessary. Your veterinarian may try to avoid surgery. If the pain persists for months, however, it could lead to corneal perforation. Therefore, some surgical options include: If the corneal sequestrum is managed with medications, your pet will need to be examined weekly. This is to watch for complications, such as the lesion separating itself from the surrounding tissue. If your cat undergoes the keratectomy procedure, its eye should be re-evaluated every seven to ten days, or until the corneal defect has healed. There is also a high probability that the condition may spread to the other eye. Cats which produce small amounts of tears, have thick lesions or those that do not have the pigmented corneal tissue removed, may also have recurring problems with this condition.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/ears/deafness-cats-causes-symptoms-and-how-help-your-cat,"Deafness in Cats: Causes, Symptoms, and How To Help Your Cat","fotolgahan/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Deafness in cats refers to a feline's inability to hear sound. When a cat can’t hear, they don’t react to noises that are present around them. Some cats may not show any symptoms if they have adapted well to hearing loss, while others may exhibit frequent meowing , hiding behaviors , and ear twitching. Hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear, preventing sound from being perceived by the brain. This can be due to various underlying health issues, including trauma or chronic ear infections . Typically, hearing loss occurs gradually over time, in which case pet parents may notice their cat responding less to their name or becoming startled more easily. In these instances, schedule a veterinary appointment promptly to determine the underlying cause. However, if the hearing loss comes on suddenly, it should be treated as a medical emergency. Affected cats should be seen by an emergency veterinarian immediately. Deafness in cats can cause the following symptoms: Not reacting to sounds Not responding to their name or commands Behavioral changes, such as hiding Ear flicking or twitching Frequent meowing Easily startled Cats who have lost hearing in only one ear may not show any obvious symptoms of hearing loss. Causes of deafness in cats can be separated into two categories—congenital (present from birth) or acquired. Congenital causes of deafness in cats include the following: Genetic abnormality: Some kittens have genetic mutations that increase their likelihood of experiencing deafness. White kittens with blue eyes are at a higher risk of deafness for this reason. Transplacental infection: If a mother cat develops a harmful infection during pregnancy, the infection can pass through the placenta to the kittens, resulting in hearing loss. Toxoplasmosis is an example of this type of infection. Acquired causes of deafness in cats include: Chronic ear infections: Longstanding ear infections can lead to excessive buildup and inflammation within the ear, affecting hearing. This is especially common in cats who overproduce sebum (an oily substance) in their ears. Chronic ear mites: As with infections, ear mites lead to thick buildup that can block the ear canal and prevent the cat from hearing in the affected ear or ears. Polyps/tumors : A cat may develop a polyp or benign (non-cancerous) tumor in their inner ear. If it grows large enough, it can block the ear canal and cause hearing loss. Medications: Certain medications are associated with toxic effects to the ear canals, which can lead to hearing loss. Aminoglycoside antibiotics, diuretics, and chemotherapy drugs are examples. Aging: As cats age, changes within their ears can lead to reduced hearing that eventually progresses to deafness. Exposure to anesthesia: Although rare, there have been cases of deafness reported following anesthetic procedures such as dental cleanings . Toxin exposure : Some household chemicals and other antiseptic solutions are toxic to the ears and may cause deafness if a cat is exposed. Chlorhexidine is an example of an antiseptic that may have these effects. Trauma: Any type of trauma that damages the inner ear can lead to deafness in cats. To diagnose deafness in cats, a veterinarian will first observe how the cat reacts to sounds and how they move around in the exam room. During this time, pet parents should discuss any concerns they have about the cat’s behavior at home and why deafness is suspected. Pet parents should also mention any known recent toxin exposure and any medications their cat is taking. Hearing loss in both ears (bilateral) is generally straightforward to diagnose since the cat will not respond to loud noises. However, hearing loss in only one ear is difficult to diagnose and may require a brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) test, which is performed at specialty veterinary hospitals. There is no specific preparation for this test, but sedation may be necessary for some patients. Hearing loss can be diagnosed in 15 minutes or less in most cases. To determine the underlying cause of deafness, additional testing may be required, which could include: Complete otoscopic exam: A veterinarian looks inside the ear canal for signs of blockage and inflammation that may be contributing to hearing loss. Neurological exam: A veterinarian checks for signs of damage to specific nerves that travel through the ear and aid in hearing. Ear swab: A veterinarian gently collects a sample of discharge from the ear, stains it or adds it to a drop of oil, and then views it underneath the microscope to identify infection or mites. Advanced imaging: To visualize the ear canal, a CT scan is used to identify concerning changes that have led to deafness. Some cases of deafness in cats are irreversible and can’t be treated, such as those involving significant nerve damage within the ear. There is also no cure for kittens who are born deaf . If hearing loss is due to a blockage within the ear canal, such as excessive ear wax or a polyp, removing this blockage usually restores hearing. Likewise, if the cat has a severe ear infection, antibiotics such as Clavamox ® can be used. In some cases, topical steroids such as triamcinolone acetonide are effective in reducing inflammation within the ear and promoting healing, which may help restore hearing. Your veterinarian will determine the best course of treatment, depending on the underlying cause of the deafness and your cat’s overall health. Cats who are born deaf and cats who have lost hearing due to aging will not regain their hearing. Cats with permanent deafness generally adapt well over time but should always be kept indoors for their safety. Cats experiencing deafness due to an ear blockage, infection, or inflammation usually fully recover once the underlying cause has been successfully treated. The timing of recovery for deafness in cats varies greatly, but it can take several weeks to regain hearing in most cases. If you're adopting a deaf cat , there are a few simple things you can do to provide a safe and comfortable home, such as keeping to a routine and using visual cues with them. Many cases of deafness in cats are not preventable, such as those due to aging or genetic abnormalities. Cats with genetic mutations linked to hearing loss should not be bred. However, there are ways to reduce the risk of hearing loss in cats. Avoiding the use of medications known to be toxic to the ears is important. Most importantly, cats should receive regular veterinary care to identify problems early, such as ear infections that can progress in severity and lead to hearing loss. Cats may show signs of hearing loss as they approach senior status, around 10 years old on average. Some cats may become deaf earlier or later, but hearing loss due to aging generally occurs gradually over time. A cat may suddenly go deaf due to exposure to a toxin or harmful medication. Hearing loss may also occur suddenly following trauma. Treatment of hearing loss in cats depends on the underlying cause. For example, ear infections may require antibiotics and sometimes anti-inflammatories for resolution. However, some cases of deafness in cats are irreversible and can’t be treated.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_septal_defect,Defect of the Ventricular Septum in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is an irregular communication in the ventricular septum, the wall that separates the ventricles (the two lower chambers of the heart) from one another. A VSD typically results in blood being diverted, or shunted, from one side of the heart to the other. The direction and volume of the shunt are determined by the size of the defect, the relationship of the pulmonary and systemic blood vessel resistances, and the presence of other anomalies. Most VSDs in small animals are subaortic (below the aortic valve) and have a right ventricular hole that is beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. In addition, most VSDs in cats are small and therefore restrictive (i.e., the difference between left and right ventricular pressures is maintained). Moderate-sized VSDs are only partially restrictive and result in various degrees of high blood pressure in the right ventricle. Large VSDs, meanwhile, have an area that is as large as or larger than the open aortic valve in the left ventricle. They are nonrestrictive, and right ventricular pressure is the same as the body’s blood pressure. Only moderate and large defects impose a pressure load upon the right ventricle. This is the most common congenital cardiac malformations in cats. Cats generally present no symptoms of the defect (asymptomatic); however symptoms commonly associated with ventricular septal defects include: The underlying cause for ventricular septic defects are unknown, though a genetic basis is suspected. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, with a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other concurrent diseases. Imaging techniques like thoracic X-rays may help to detect larger VSDs, which would cause a left (or even a generalized) enlarged heart from the increased flow of blood through the heart. High blood pressure in the lungs, chronic heart failure and right to left shunts may be visualized as well. A two-dimensional echocardiographic study, which uses sonographic imaging to view the activity of the heart, may demonstrate heart enlargement. The right heart will also be enlarged if the defect is moderate-sized or large, or if there are other heart abnormalities in addition to VSD. Most patients can be treated on an outpatient basis. Large shunts may be surgically repaired during a cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients with moderate or large shunts may also undergo pulmonary artery banding as a palliative (relieves some discomfort but does not cure the disease) procedure. If your cat is showing signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), its activity should be restricted. Your doctor may also advise you to impose a strict low sodium diet if your cat is diagnosed with CHF, to minimize pressure on the heart. Cats that are diagnosed with overt CHF are generally given 6 to 18 months to live with medical treatment. If your cat has only a small shunt it may continue to have a normal life span if there are no concurrent disease that are posing a direct threat to its health. Do not breed your cat if it has been diagnosed with ventricular septal defect, as this defect is thought to be genetically transmitted. Your veterinarian will schedule regular follow-up appointments for your cat to follow its progress, retake x-ray and ultrasound images, and adjust any medications or therapies as needed.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_cerebellar_degeneration_brain_disease_in_cats,Degeneration of the Cerebellum of the Brain in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cerebellar degeneration in cats is a brain disease that affects a specific area of the brain known as the cerebellum. In cerebellar degeneration, the cells within the cerebellum die, causing neurological symptoms. Symptoms of cerebellar degeneration in cats include: Infection with feline panleukopenia virus either in utero or as a neonate may cause cerebellar degeneration. A genetic predisposition for the condition is seen in dogs and may also be possible in cats. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may reveal a smaller than normal cerebellum. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may be normal or abnormal depending on the individual cause. Biopsy of the cerebellum is the definitive means of diagnosis. Routine blood and urine testing may be necessary to rule out other disease conditions which may appear similar. There is no curative treatment, but medications such as amantidine, buspirone, co-enzyme Q10 and acetyl-l-carnitine have shown some promise. Because of the lack of coordination associated with this condition, restrict the cat’s activity to safe areas of the household where injury cannot occur. Avoid stairs, sharp objects, swimming pools, and other dangers. Another effect of incoordination in the cat may present as trouble eating. The cat may require physical aid in eating, though it can continue to eat a normal diet. Nursing care to keep the cat free of urine and feces may also be necessary. To protect your cat and potential offspring from brain disease, avoid vaccinating pregnant queens with modified live virus vaccines, particularly the feline panleukopenia vaccine.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_corneal_degenerations_infiltrations,Degeneration of the Cornea in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The cornea is the transparent lining that covers the external front of the eyeball; that is, the iris and the pupil (respectively, the colored area that expands and contracts to allow light in, and the lens that transmits the light and image to the brain – the black center). The cornea is continuous with the white part of the eye, the sclera, which covers the rest of the eyeball. Beneath the cornea and the sclera is a layer of connective tissue that supports the eyeball from inside, called the stroma. Corneal degeneration is a one-sided or two-sided condition, secondary to other eye (ocular) or body (systemic) disorders. It is characterized by lipid (fat-soluble molecules) or calcium deposits within the corneal stroma, and/or epithelium (tissue composed of layers of cells that line the inner hollow of the eyeball, beneath the stroma). Lipid and calcium deposition can affect cats, but it is rare and typically occurs secondary to metabolic disorders. Corneal degeneration related to metabolic disorder is seen even less frequently than lipid deposits. This condition causes the cornea to appear rough, with distinct margins where the edge of the cornea meets with the sclera. Associated ocular conditions, such as corneal scars, inflammation of the cornea, or chronic uveitis (long-standing inflammatory disease of the front of the eye), can lead to degeneration of the cornea. If one or more of these conditions have been present, having the cornea checked for further damage would be wise for the prevention of severe and permanent damage. One of the main causes of corneal degeneration is lipid (fat) deposits in the supporting structure of the inner eyeball: the stroma and the epithelium. While lipids are a normal part of the body, being, as they are, a principal structure of living cells, hyper deposits of lipids in the tissues can bring about disorders to the system they are inhabiting. Systemic hyperlipoproteinemia, a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated concentrations of cholesterol and specific lipoprotein particles in the blood plasma, may increase the risk of deposits in the stroma, or may worsen already existing deposits. Hyperlipoproteinemia can be secondary to hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism (chronic production of too much cortisone), pancreatitis, nephrotic syndrome (a disorder in which the kidneys are damaged), and liver disease. Hypercalcemia, a condition that is characterized by the production of too much calcium, can increase the risk of deposits of calcium in the stroma, which can also lead to corneal degeneration. Calcium deposits in the stroma are seen less frequently than lipid deposits. Other disorders that can affect the cornea and its functionality are hypophosphatemia, an electrolyte irregularity distinguished by too little phosphorus in the blood, and hypervitaminosis D, the production of excess vitamin D. Your veterinarian will look for several indicators before settling on a diagnosis. Your cat's eyes will be coated with fluorescein stain, an orange dye that is viewed in blue light to detect damage to the cornea, or to detect the presence of foreign objects on the surface of the eye. The stain examination may show a corneal ulcer with varying degrees of edema (swelling). The edema, if present, will appear bluish to gray and can vary in size depending on severity, with indistinct margins. The stain would also show the presence of a corneal scar – which would cause some opacity, appearing gray to white depending on severity. Corneal ulceration may be associated with worsening of the disease, and vision may be affected if the disease is in an advanced state. Severe vision impairment may occur if a primary eye disease, such as uveitis, is found to be present. If the fluorescein stain does not show any abnormalities, your veterinarian will look for corneal stromal weakness (dystrophy), which affects both eyes, often affecting proportional focus. The cornea will be gray to white in appearance, with distinct margins. This disorder does not retain fluorescein stain and is not associated with inflammation of the eye. If an object has entered the eye (inflammatory cell infiltrate) it will cause the cornea to appear gray to white, with indistinct margins; microscopic examination of the corneal cells will reveal white blood cells, the cells that are responsible for defending the body against foreign materials and infection, indicating that organisms are present in the eye. If a disease of the eye is present, your veterinarian will treat the condition accordingly. Lipid and calcium deposits that impair vision or create discomfort to the eye, either from a roughened surface, or from disruption and ulceration of the corneal epithelium, may benefit from a vigorous corneal scraping, or a superficial removal of part of the cornea (keratectomy). These procedures would be followed by medical management, since deposits are likely to recur in patients following superficial keratectomy surgery. Your cat's diet will also be a consideration. If hyperlipoproteinemia is diagnosed, a low-fat diet would be beneficial for hindering further progression. Your veterinarian will advise you on this. Both methods of treatment can be useful for slowing or stopping progression of the disease. Your doctor will want to monitor your cat's serum cholesterol and triglycerides to assess the effectiveness of dietary management, if that has been recommended as a maintenance strategy. If a primary disease if present, its will be monitored for progression or regression, and treated according to the indications and comfort needs of your pet. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_iris_atrophy,Degeneration of the Iris in the Eye in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Iris atrophy refers to the degeneration of the iris, the colored part of the eye that surround the black center (or the pupil). This medical condition can affect cats of all ages and breeds, but appears to be more common in cats with blue irises. There is also a secondary type that is due to chronic inflammation or high intraocular pressure resulting from glaucoma. Vision is not usually affected by iris atrophy, but there may be some sensitivity to light. Other typical symptoms associated with this of disorder include: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ophthalmological exam on your cat. The initial goal will be to differentiate iris atrophy from congenital iris anomalies, as there are a variety of other eye issues that can be the cause of the symptoms, such as ris aplasia (failure of the iris to develop normally), iris hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of the iris), iris coloboma (a complete, full-thickness area of lack of development of all layers of the iris), and polycoria (when more than one pupil is present in a single iris within the animal's eye, each with the apparent ability to constrict). Iris atrophy is not reversible, so much of the treatment is designed to target the underlying disease that has caused it, or to halt the progression of the disease. Due to the nature of this medical condition, it is possible that it will continue to progress as your cat ages. Featured image: iStock.com/beest Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_superficial_necrolytic_dermatitis,Degenerative Skin Disorder (Necrolytic Dermatitis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is characterized by the deterioration and death of skin cells. High levels of the hormone glucagon in the blood (which stimulates production of blood sugar in response to low blood sugar levels) and deficiencies in amino acids, zinc, and essential fatty acid are believed to play a role in superficial necrolytic dermatitis, either directly or indirectly. Fortunately, this disorder is uncommon in cats. Superficial necrolytic dermatitis is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. This skin disorder will generally affect the cat's legs and torso, causing: In cats, superficial necrolytic dermatitis has been associated with pancreatic cancer, liver disease, and intestinal lymphoma (cancer of white blood cells in the intestine). Other causes include a nutritional imbalance due to a lack of amino acids or a deficiency in the cat's essential fatty acids and zinc; or metabolic abnormalities caused by high serum glucagon levels, liver dysfunction, or a combination of these conditions. The skin condition is rarely associated with a glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor, or long-term phenobarbital and phenytoin medication, which is used to treat seizures. Additionally, superficial necrolytic dermatitis is generally an outward symptom of advanced hepatic disease, or of coincident hepatic disease and diabetes mellitus. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health, onset of symptoms, and possible health conditions that might have precipitated this condition. Some blood tests may return with abnormal results, such as high levels of bile acids in the blood, high plasma glucagon levels, low amino acids, and high insulin. Sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP, excreted in the bile) levels may also increase to abnormal levels in the blood. X-ray and ultrasound imaging usually are not helpful in diagnosing glucagon. However, an ultrasound may reveal advanced liver disease. Skin biopsies (tissue samples) are crucial for making a correct diagnosis, but only early lesions are useful for an examination. Your veterinarian will treat the underlying disease process if possible, and will prescribe the appropriate medicine to treat the cat's symptoms. Most cats can be treated on an outpatient basis, but in some cases, hospitalized care will be necessary. Outright liver failure should be treated with supportive care. Cats with glucagon-secreting tumors can be cured with surgery, but the tumors will typically spread quickly, before surgical intervention can reverse their progress. Most of these cases are associated with chronic, irreversible liver disease. Unfortunately, most cats with this disease will also have a severe internal disease with a poor prognosis. A specially-formulated prescription shampoo can help to remove the crusts and may make your cat feel more comfortable. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/dementia-cats,Dementia in Cats,"Dementia, also known as cognitive dysfunction, is a condition seen in some senior cats that affects their memory, critical thinking, behavior, and reason. This condition is like Alzheimer’s disease in people. Dementia is commonly referred to as “becoming senile” and can result in some sudden changes in your cat's behavior. More than a quarter of cats aged 11 to 14 show at least one sign of dementia. It’s even more common as they age, with half of cats over the age of 15 showing signs of cognitive dysfunction. Dementia is the result of age-related degeneration of the brain and subsequent death of neurons, or the powerhouse cells inside of the brain. These neurons are needed for memory, learning, attention, normal sleep cycles, and spatial awareness, among other things. There are many other conditions that are common in senior cats that can result in behavior changes that can look like dementia. If you notice any changes in your senior cat’s behavior, visit their veterinarian to rule out common medical conditions affecting older cats. Many of these conditions are manageable with early intervention. Dementia is not considered a medical emergency. However, if your cat has other signs in addition to behavior changes—such as vomiting , lethargy , or lack of appetite —contact your veterinarian. Symptoms of dementia in cats include: Acting disoriented or lost Vocalizing , often at night Staring off into space while looking at a wall or corner Forgetting to eat or drink unless food bowls are put in front of them Going to the bathroom outside the litterbox Changes in sleep cycle , being awake and active in the middle of the night Unusual interactions with other pets or family members (becoming more needy, more reactive , or more aloof ) Forgetting that they have just been fed and asking to eat again Poor grooming habits Sleeping more than usual Cognitive dysfunction occurs when age-related decline causes a buildup of a protein called beta amyloid. As this protein builds up, damage occurs to the brain, and blood flow to the brain is slowed. This results in the death of a cat’s brain neurons. Neurons are responsible for receiving information and for sending out commands based on that input. When neurons start to break down, it affects the cat's thought process and behavior. Memory is often affected. Cats may forget when feeding time is or where their litter box is located. They may even find themselves lost in a room, or even in a corner. Because circadian rhythms are controlled by the brain, sleep patterns are often disrupted by dementia. Your cat may often be awake at night, vocal and confused why everyone is sleeping. They may sleep more during the day to make up for restless nights. Senior cats of any breed can develop dementia. Dementia can be tricky to diagnose, so veterinarians rely on ruling out other conditions first. Behavior changes can have other underlying causes beside cognitive dysfunction. Hyperthyroidism and hypertension can make a senior cat act grumpy toward family members and become more vocal at night. Chronic kidney disease is common in senior cats and can contribute to urinating outside of their litter box. Arthritis can make cats slow down, sleep more, or struggle to maintain normal grooming habits. Because there are many other common diseases that could be causing your cat's behavior changes, it’s important for your veterinarian to rule out other conditions before diagnosing dementia. Your vet will perform a physical exam, looking for any changes in your cat’s overall health. They will also do blood work and may recommend a urinalysis. X-rays or pain medication trials may also be done to see if arthritis or other pain could be contributing to your cat's changes in behavior. Pay attention to any patterns tied to your cat’s abnormal behavior. It may be helpful to video these episodes to share with your vet. Treatment for dementia in cats is often focused on a combination of environmental enrichment or changes, supplements , and medication. With enrichment, new elements are added to a cat's environment to help with disorientation. A treat ball can be given to cats that feel like they’re hungry after eating. These toys are made to stimulate the mind while rewarding your cat with treats when they succeed. Like crossword puzzles for older people, they may help to keep the mind stimulated to combat rapid decline of brain function. You may also want to provide your cat with an automatic feeding bowl . These can provide small meals in the middle of the night for senior cats who find themselves hungry at odd hours. A night light or a radio playing soft music may help your cat with anxiety caused by disrupted sleep patterns and a quiet home. Your veterinarian may also recommend melatonin in cats experiencing an irregular sleep cycle. Environmental changes may mean altering your home to minimize your cat’s stress and help them have easier access to their needs. This may include purchasing a litter box with a low entry point. Creating better access for your cat can help prevent house soiling. Your cat may benefit from being in a smaller space with access to food, water, and a litter box to minimize their chances of getting disoriented and lost, especially at night. The use of supplements may have some benefit in cats with dementia. SAMe, an antioxidant, may be helpful. CoQ10, omega fatty acids, and Vitamin E may also be recommended. Supplements containing some of these ingredients like Nordic Naturals® Omega-3 Cat ™ and Fera® Fish Oil + Vitamin E are readily available. Some senior diets, like Hill’s® Feline j/d prescription food , contain antioxidants, fatty acids, and joint protectors. Your vet will be able to determine if a supplement addition makes sense based on your cat’s diagnosis. Veterinary diets fortified with calming milk protein—like Royal Canin® Calm Cat Food —may be prescribed. This protein can also be found in the calming supplements Vetoquinol® Zylkene and Solliquin ®. Calming pheromones can also be placed in the home to reduce stress. When these changes and supplements aren’t enough, prescription medications may be recommended. Gabapentin may be prescribed for anxiety or pain . If your cat has mobility issues in addition to cognitive issues, they may benefit from monthly Solensia ™ injections. Selegiline and propentophylline (Vivitonin®) are also commonly prescribed for patients with cognitive dysfunction. Occasionally, anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are also prescribed. Speak with your vet to see what the best treatment is for your cat. While there’s no cure for dementia in cats, you can do several things to manage dementia and minimize stress in your cat’s life. Make sure your senior cat has easy access to all their basic needs (food, water, litterbox) When enriching your cat’s environment, try to avoid making any big changes that could be stressful to them. Cats with dementia may be stuck in their ways and may perceive any change as anxiety-inducing. If you’re introducing something new to help improve their access, consider keeping their old litter box or food bowls where they were. Add newer, easier elements to the space. Medications or supplements may be helpful for your cat to navigate this time in their lives. While there is no clear way to prevent the development of dementia in cats, keeping your senior cat sharp can delay symptoms. Playing regularly with your cat can be helpful for keeping your cat stimulated. Consider the use of treat puzzles , treat balls, and other interactive games. Establish a routine for exercise. This will benefit your cat’s mind, joints, and overall wellness. Open the blinds during the day so that your cat can look outside to see what’s happening beyond your home. Cats can have normal lifespans with dementia if quality of life can be maintained. Featured Image: knape/E+ via GettyImages Cognitive Dysfunction , Cornell Feline Health Center . 2018. Gunn-Moore, D.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_Demodicosis,Demodectic Mange in Cats (Demodex Mites),"Demodicosis, or demodectic mange, is an inflammatory skin disease in cats that can cause itching, excessive ear debris, headshaking, sores, and hair loss. It is caused by various types of microscopic Demodex mites that can infect your cat’s skin. There are three types of Demodex mites that affect cats: Demodex gatoi , Demodex cati , and a rare species of Demodex that is not named. Demodex mites can also affect other animals in your house, but the mites are species specific. This means that Demodex mites that affect your dog can’t transfer to cats and vice versa. Demodectic mange is caused by these three types of Demodex mites: Demodex gatoi . This type is usually seen in healthy cats. They live in the top layer of skin and are contagious to other cats. Demodex cati . These mites usually occur in cats that have a suppressed immune system because of an underlying disease or condition. They can be found in hair follicles and sometimes in the ear canals of affected cats. A rare and unnamed species of Demodex . This type of Demodex is very rare, but it has been associated with underlying disease. These mites can also be found in hair follicles. Symptoms that are seen depend upon the species of the mite on your cat. The most common symptom of Demodex gatoi is itching/overgrooming, which may lead to hair loss and skin scaling. You may also see crusts and sores on your cat as a result of too much licking and scratching. Skin issues from Demodex cati can be confined to one area, or they may be spread all over your cat’s body. Common skin issues include redness, scaling, crusting, and hair loss. The itching may be mild to severe. In some cats, excessive ear debris and ear irritation/headshaking may be the only symptoms. The diagnosis of demodectic mange involves testing for mites and other steps depending on the findings and the type of mite. Demodex gatoi can be diagnosed by using skin scrapings or tape to collect skin and debris that can be examined under a microscope. Fecal testing to look for mites or eggs may also be useful. However, Demodex gatoi can be extremely hard to find. If your vet suspects an infection, but can’t locate the actual mites, they may recommend going ahead with treatment. A positive response to treatment would confirm the diagnosis. Demodex cati is generally easy to find on deep skin scrapings, which are examined using a microscope. The mites may also be found on ear swabs that are examined under a microscope. Cats with Demodex cati often have underlying diseases that suppress the immune system. This can include feline viral diseases ( FeLV , FIV ), cancer, diabetes, or toxoplasmosis. In these cases, your vet should run further diagnostics to determine an underlying cause. All species of Demodex mites should respond to the same treatments. Products that are generally effective for the treatment of Demodex in cats include 2% lime sulfur dips weekly for several weeks or at least two applications of Bravecto® or Revolution Plus® . No product is specifically licensed for the treatment of Demodex in cats, but the flea medications are effective. Because Demodex gatoi is contagious to other cats, all cats that have been exposed to an affected cat should be treated. Treatments are generally successful at eliminating Demodex gatoi mites, but the itching may persist for several weeks after the mites are dead. Your cat’s response to treatment for Demodex cati depends upon identifying and treating any underlying disease that is suppressing your cat’s immune system. Demodex mites cannot survive in the environment, so environmental treatment is not necessary. These mites are not contagious to humans or dogs.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/dental-issues-cats,Dental Issues in Cats,"Dental issues in cats are very common and can have serious consequences. According to the Cornell University Feline Health Center, 50-90% of cats older than 4 years of age suffer from some form of dental disease. For cats, tooth infections are one of the top reasons to see your veterinarian each year. Fortunately, the most common forms of these diseases are preventable or treatable with appropriate dental care and monitoring. Common dental issues in cats include gingivitis, periodontal disease, and tooth resorption. It’s important for your cat to have a yearly physical examination with a veterinarian, since most cats do not show obvious symptoms of dental disease. It’s equally important for your cat to have routine dental cleanings and oral examinations, done under general anesthesia or heavy sedation. These procedures include dental x-rays, which allow your veterinarian to detect hidden dental disease early in your cat’s life. Excessive drooling Blood-tinged saliva Halitosis (bad breath) Yellow/brown tartar on the teeth Pawing at the face, mouth, and head Shaking head Jaw- or teeth-chattering Dropping food from mouth Difficulty swallowing Decreased or lack of appetite Refusal of dry food or swallowing dry food whole Preferring only wet or moist food Weight loss Loose teeth or tooth loss Dental disease in cats often starts with a buildup of plaque that hardens and becomes tartar. If the tartar is not removed, it will lead to gingivitis , a painful condition where the gums get inflamed. Gingivitis eventually leads to periodontal disease if left untreated. Cats may lose teeth and be prone to infections that affect other organs in the body. In many cases, dental disease causes a cat to stop eating, which leads to a variety of health problems. Plaque is a thin film that develops on the teeth and is home to thousands of bacteria. Some plaque is removed naturally when cats eat or through actions by the cat’s rough tongue, but without daily tooth-brushing, mineralization occurs. When plaque hardens by absorbing minerals from both the saliva and the gingiva itself, it is called calculus or tartar. Calculus provides a rough surface that disease-causing bacteria can attach to. Tartar has a rough surface that creates a perfect environment for more plaque to stick to, making dental disease worse. Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums caused by an accumulation of plaque. Your cat’s mouth will become red, swollen, and painful. This inflammatory process starts when a thin layer of plaque, which contains bacteria, builds up on the teeth. If this plaque is not removed, the bacteria migrate deeper toward the gumline. The cat’s immune system will respond to these bacteria, leading to inflammation. Gingivitis has also been linked to a number of infectious or systemic diseases, including FeLV , FIV , severe kidney disease , and diabetes . Luckily for cats that develop gingivitis, the condition is usually reversible. The treatment recommended will depend on how severely your cat is affected, but generally involves: Brushing your cat’s teeth at home Antibiotics either as a pill or an oral rinse: Clindamycin or Clavamox are common oral medications Vetoquinol Dental Rinse Having the teeth scaled during a dental cleaning, which requires general anesthesia In severe cases, removing the teeth is the only way to remove the source of inflammation. Periodontitis, or periodontal disease, results from the progression of untreated plaque, tartar, and gingivitis. Unlike gingivitis, periodontitis cannot be reversed once it progresses. With periodontitis, the tissue damage is much more severe and affects the gums, the ligaments that attach the tooth to the gums, and the underlying bone. In some cats, periodontal disease can develop as young as 1 year of age. This irreversible damage results in loss of tooth support and, in turn, loss of the tooth as well. Periodontitis is treated with a thorough cleaning by your veterinarian, both above and below the gumline, while your cat is under anesthesia. It’s important that your vet takes x-rays during the cleaning to determine the extent of bone loss and help decide if any teeth need to be extracted. Some cats can develop a severe oral inflammation called stomatitis, or feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS) . Stomatitis is a complex condition, and the underlying cause is unknown. One theory is that stomatitis develops from cats having an adverse reaction to their own bacteria and plaque in the mouth. This condition can be painful and cause a substantial decrease in a cat’s quality of life. Stomatitis is treated with a dental procedure under anesthesia and a variety of medications—such as antibiotics, pain medication, and anti-inflammatories—in addition to oral care at home with daily toothbrushing and an oral rinse. Often with severe stomatitis, partial (all premolars and molars) or full-mouth extractions are performed. Unlike humans, cats do not develop cavities; they develop resorptive lesions, which are the most frequently seen dental issues in cats. Tooth resorption (also called cervical line lesions or feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions) is a process in which the structure of a tooth breaks down, beginning on the inside and progressing outward to other parts of the tooth. Often the crown of the tooth may be lost, and the tooth root might be covered by the gums. The cause of tooth resorption is not known, but it is suspected that it is stimulated by inflammation cause by periodontitis and endodontic disease. In most cases of resorption in cats, the affected teeth need to be extracted surgically by a veterinarian. If you suspect your cat has dental disease or is exhibiting signs of mouth pain or discomfort, have them examined by their veterinarian as soon as possible. Depending on the degree of dental disease present, treatment options are highly variable and may include: Toothbrushing at home Oral medications Dental cleaning X-rays Dental surgery The best way to prevent gingivitis in cats is to regularly remove plaque buildup by toothbrushing . It is important to use only tooth gel or toothpaste designed specifically for cats , as human products can be toxic to them. Plaque that remains on the teeth for more than three days turns into a hard material, calculus, that cannot be removed by a toothbrush. If your cat does not allow toothbrushing, try at least to wipe the teeth with a gauze pad every two or three days. Some treats, oral rinses , and dry foods can also help to remove plaque; ask your veterinarian for recommendations. Adding a supplement to your cat’s water helps to freshen breath, kills germs, and can remove plaque. Your veterinarian might also apply a barrier sealant or recommend a plaque prevention gel. If your cat has been treated for periodontitis, you will need to continue oral hygiene care at home. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions, which might include: Daily toothbrushing Dietary changes Plaque prevention gel Oral rinses Frequent (every 6 months to 1 year) preventive teeth cleanings will help to prevent a recurrence of periodontitis and further bone loss. Your veterinarian will help you assess what frequency is right for your cat.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hypopituitarism,Destruction of the Pituitary Gland in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hypopituitarism is a condition associated with low production of hormones that are produced by the pituitary gland, a small endocrine gland located near the hypothalamus at the base of the brain. Several hormones are produced by the pituitary gland, any one or more of which may be lacking. Of these hormones, some of the more clinically significant ones are the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), the adrenocorticotropin hormone (produced by the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates the adrenal cortex), the luteinizing hormone (stimulates secretion of sex steroids), the follicle stimulating hormone (secreted by the gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary gland), and the growth hormone (GH). Hypopituitarism can also result from the destruction of the pituitary gland by a cancerous, degenerative, or anomalous process. The symptoms of hypopituitarism can vary depending on which hormones are lacking, and which body function is being affected by the deficit. For example, lack of luteinizing hormones can result in sexual abnormalities such as abnormally small genitals, and GH deficiency can result in lack of appropriate growth or dwarfism (typically developed within the first two to three months). If the gland is being affected by cancer or tumor, the cat may be experiencing pain in its head (with consequential head-pressing), or visual problems. Other common symptoms include: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, growth, behavioral development, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as trauma to the head. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood tests are the most reliable method for diagnosis of this condition. Standard blood test results may show increased levels of eosinophilia (white blood cells), lymphocytosis (disease of the lymph glands), hypophosphatemia (phosphorus deficiency), or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Other laboratory tests will test the levels of hormones in the bloodstream. Your veterinarian will want to have your cat brought in for a morning blood draw in order to measure basal levels of TSH and prolactin. Another blood test, called a dynamic test, measures hormone levels after injection of a hormone stimulating substance. This can be used to check levels of ACTH and GH. The results of these tests generally are the best indicators for hypopituitarism. Visual imaging techniques, primarily using X-ray, can be used to check for the presence of a tumor or cyst in the vicinity of the pituitary gland. Management of hypopituitarism is usually conducted on an outpatient basis. Growth hormone supplements will be administered three times weekly for 4–6 weeks, and repeated if necessary. Tumors of the pituitary gland can be surgically removed in some cases, but the prognosis is generally not favorable. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up visits in order to monitor your cat's blood and urinary glucose concentration. Growth hormone supplementation will be suspended if glucosuria (an abnormal condition of osmotic diuresis due to excretion of glucose by the kidneys) develops, or if the blood glucose is more than 150 mg/dL. Your cat's skin and haircoat should improve within 6–8 weeks of initiating growth hormone and thyroid supplementation. Generally, in the case of low GH levels, there is no increase in stature because the growth plates have usually closed by the time a diagnosis has been made. Unfortunately, because many of the hormones that are affected by pituitary disorders are essential for the overall health, the long term prognosis for hypopituitarism is poor.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_diabetes_mellitus,"Diabetes in Cats: Signs, Treatment, and Prognosis","matucha/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Diabetes mellitus (commonly referred to as diabetes) is a disease of the endocrine system in which the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't use the insulin it does produce. You may be surprised to find out that cats can have diabetes, too. Diabetes in cats is a very common condition. In fact, it’s estimated that one in 100 cats will develop diabetes in their lifetime. Diabetes is also much more prevalent in cats that weigh more than 9 pounds, which directly links this condition to overweight cats . Let’s look at everything a pet parent should know about diabetes in cats, from signs of diabetes in cats to cat diabetes treatment. Like people, there are different types of diabetes in cats. These include: Type I —Type I diabetes mellitus is also called insulin-deficient diabetes. This type of diabetes, where the pancreas is unable to produce the level of insulin that the body needs, is rarely seen in cats. Type II —Type II diabetes mellitus is also called insulin-resistant or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes mellitus in cats. Type II diabetes is characterized by a relative insulin deficiency. This means that even though the cat’s pancreas may produce adequate levels of insulin, the tissues are unable to use it for glucose metabolism. It’s important for pet parents to understand the symptoms of diabetes in cats, and to contact your veterinarian immediately if you believe that your cat may be experiencing any of them. Common signs of diabetes in cats include: Increased thirst (polydipsia, PD) Increase in frequency and volume of urination (polyuria, PU) PU/PD is often the first sign pet parents notice in a cat with diabetes. Filling up the water bowl more often and having to clean urine out of the litterbox more frequently are common indications that your cat might have diabetes. Urinating outside the litter box Along with PU/PD, cats often have urinary accidents outside of the box with untreated or unregulated diabetes. They have an urgency to go due to the increased thirst and high blood sugar levels, which often leads them to go outside instead of inside the litter box. Increased appetite initially, then decreased appetite : Up to 50% of cats with diabetes have a decreased appetite at the time of diagnosis. Weight loss (despite a nutritious diet and healthy appetite) Vomiting Muscle wasting Lethargy or weakness Poor coat quality ( oily coat , dandruff ) Behavioral changes: Cats with undiagnosed or unregulated diabetes are often irritable or even uncharacteristically aggressive . This is often the result of them not feeling like themselves as their blood sugar fluctuates. A once-energetic and playful cat will become lethargic and disinterested over a short period of time when they are dealing with undiagnosed diabetes. Plantigrade stance: In cases of uncontrolled diabetes in cats, pets may develop damage to the nerves in their hind limbs. Instead of walking on their paw pads, they will walk with their whole foot almost or completely touching the ground (called a dropped hock). Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)—DKA is a dangerous medical emergency that occurs when a cat goes a prolonged period with high blood sugar. As a result, they start to develop ketoacids in the bloodstream. This can happen because of undiagnosed diabetes for a significant amount of time, concurrent disease such as pancreatitis, or when a cat's insulin treatment is no longer sufficient and a dose change is needed. If not treated swiftly, DKA is fatal. Several of the symptoms of diabetes in cats are not specific to diabetes alone. Take your cat to your veterinarian to rule out other diseases (such as kidney disease , hyperthyroidism , or pancreatitis ). It’s estimated that between 0.5-1% of the general feline population suffers from diabetes, but an increasing number of cats are being diagnosed each year. Any cat has the potential to develop diabetes throughout their lifetime, but certain breeds—such as the Burmese cat breed —have been reported to carry a higher lifetime risk. Most commonly, diabetes is seen in middle-aged male cats that are obese. The most important risk factors for diabetes mellitus in cats are: Obesity Lack of physical activity Increasing age Sex (males are diagnosed more frequently than females) Being neutered Glucocorticoid (steroid) therapy Certain medical conditions may also predispose a cat to developing diabetes. These conditions include: Hyperthyroidism Pancreatitis Asthma (due to steroid medication use) Diabetes in cats is diagnosed by a combination of typical clinical signs reported by pet parents in addition to elevated glucose levels in cat's blood and the urine. This can be diagnosed by performing full blood work and a urinalysis . Your veterinarian may also use the blood sample to perform a serum fructosamine. This allows your vet to see if your cat’s blood glucose has been elevated over time, and not just at the time it was measured in the hospital. Unfortunately, there is no cure for diabetes in cats. Treatment of diabetes in cats is a lifelong commitment and necessitates dedication from all family members. It also requires consistent, open communication with your veterinarian. At the time of diagnosis, your cat may need to be hospitalized for several days until their glucose level is controlled and they are feeling well enough to go home with you. If your cat is in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis at the time of diagnosis, they will likely require extended hospital stays and intensive care. The primary goals of treatment of feline diabetes are centered on: Restoring normal blood glucose levels Reducing or eliminating the clinical signs of excess thirst and urination Normalizing weight and appetite Avoiding inducing inappropriately low glucose levels Your veterinarian will develop a plan that is tailored to your cat’s specific needs. If your cat has concurrent diseases, your veterinarian will recommend treatment for those as well. Once your vet makes a diagnosis of diabetes, there are a few medical and lifestyle changes that you and your cat will need to make. The first step is starting insulin . Insulin is given by injection and will help your cat maintain normal blood sugar levels. Your vet will also start your cat on a diabetic-friendly diet to help prevent blood sugar changes. Being on a prescription diet for feline diabetes can help to decrease the amount of insulin your cat needs. Wet food diets are preferred as these diets are lower in carbohydrates (sugar) and higher in protein. However, your vet may say it’s OK to give a mixture of wet and dry food , depending on your cat’s preference. Diabetes is also treated by ensuring your cat remains at a lean body weight . Portion control with feeding and increased exercise can also be helpful. The cost of treatment for diabetes in cats varies depending on a few factors. The initial cost to get your cat on the right insulin dose and diet is much more than the maintenance. Vet visits to check insulin levels are needed routinely and when a cat isn't feeling well. The cost of treatment involves vet visits, lab work, insulin, syringes, and a special diet. Insulin vials cost anywhere from $25–$100 depending on the amount and the brand/formulation. Each vial is usually good for one month. A vet visit can cost $30–$120 depending on location. Blood and urine testing is likely another $50–$100. Prescription diabetic cat food can cost upwards of $60 for a case of canned food. A small bag of dry food typically starts around $25. Cats with diabetes can live long, healthy lives if treated promptly and properly. Cats that develop DKA or those that have their kidney enzymes affected usually have a worse prognosis. In some cases, diabetic cats may even go into remission. If your cat was diagnosed with other illnesses, this might complicate the regulation of your cat’s diabetes and/or affect your cat’s long-term prognosis. Cats with diabetes that do not undergo treatment will succumb to the disease. Dangerously high blood sugar for sustained periods of time will cause suffering and are ultimately fatal. When caring for your diabetic cat, you will need to consistently perform few tasks to help manage your pet’s condition. At-home monitoring of your cat’s blood glucose levels is important for monitoring your cat’s glycemic control long-term. This typically involves pricking the inside of your cat’s ear and using a glucometer ( AlphaTRAK ®). Glucose levels can also be monitored in a less invasive manner—by measuring glucose levels in the urine —although this method is not as accurate as blood measurements. Not all cats are amenable to blood glucose monitoring at home. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine the method of monitoring that works best for you and your cat. One of the most serious risks and potential complication of managing a diabetic cat at home is the risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This can happen to any pet being managed for diabetes at home, even if you give them the appropriate dose (or less than the appropriate dose) prescribed by the veterinarian. For this reason, it’s important that you strictly follow your veterinarian’s instructions and schedule for feeding and giving insulin, and that you never administer a full dose of insulin to your pet if they are not eating. Nutrition is an important part of managing diabetes in cats. Your veterinarian may recommend a diet change to help regulate your cat’s glucose levels and promote weight loss, as obesity complicates diabetes management. Once you have identified a nutritional plan that works for your cat, it’s critical that you maintain a strict feeding schedule. Don’t change your cat’s diet without consulting your veterinarian first. Keeping your cat physically active is another important component of helping your cat achieve a healthy weight. Keep a daily log of your cat's: Diet Glucose test results Daily insulin dose Weekly body weight You can see trends and recognize when your cat deviates from their regular pattern. Any change in patterns should be brought to your vet’s attention. WRITTEN BY Veterinarian Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_diabetes_insipidus,Diabetes Insipidus in Cats,"Diabetes insipidus is an extremely rare condition in cats. The most obvious symptoms of diabetes insipidus in cats are excessive urination and excessive thirst, due to an irregular production or response to ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone). ADH is normally produced in the hypothalamus of the brain and stored in the pituitary gland. Without normal ADH production and response, the kidneys are prevented from reabsorbing water from the bloodstream, forcing the cat to urinate excessively and drink much more water to compensate. Diabetes insipidus should not be confused with the much more common diabetes mellitus in cats. Both diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus share the symptoms of excessive thirst and excessive urinating, however the causes of these conditions — including treatment options — vary. There are two forms of Diabetes Insipidus : Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI): the hypothalamus does not produce any or enough ADH. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI): the kidneys do not respond appropriately to ADH. Your veterinarian will want to rule out any other conditions before treating diabetes insipidus. Fortunately, some types of diabetes insipidus are treatable, and many cats can lead normal, healthy lives. The most common symptoms of diabetes insipidus in cats may include: Excessive thirst Excessive urination Incontinence due to increased and frequent urination Dehydration Decreased appetite Weight loss Lethargy Possible neurological abnormalities (seizures, disorientation, and incoordination) There are two main causes for diabetes insipidus in cats which may be treatable, depending on the cause. Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) : A condition that occurs when the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, does not secrete enough ADH, or the pituitary gland is unable to store it properly. Cats with CDI tend to be middle-aged and senior pets. Central diabetes insipidus in cats can be caused by a congenital defect, head trauma (such as a car accident or injury), cancer within a specific part of the brain or for reasons unknown. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) : A condition that occurs when the kidneys cannot respond appropriately to the ADH secreted by the brain. Acquired NDI in cats has many causes, and there is no known breed, age, or gender predisposition to secondary NDI. Causes of acquired NDI include: Medications Diseases such as Addison’s disease, Cushing’s disease or pyometra Kidney damage, such as infection, inflammation, urethral blockage or chronic kidney disease Liver disease High calcium Electrolyte abnormalities Leptospirosis infection Hyperthyroidism Idiopathic (unknown) If a cat is diagnosed with NDI a veterinarian will want to treat the underlying condition, if possible, to reverse the condition. When diagnosing diabetes insipidus in cats, your veterinarian will start with a physical exam and an extensive history. They will want to run the same lab work and testing that is also ordered to determine the common (but vague) symptoms of excessive urination and excessive thirst in cats. This lab work may include: Blood chemistry Complete blood count Urinalysis with culture ACTH stimulation test Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test Serum bile acids Thyroid function tests This level of lab work in cats will help to rule out a more common condition such as kidney disease, hyperthyroidism or diabetes in cats. It’s important to note at one time veterinarians ran a water deprivation test to diagnose diabetes insipidus in cats. However, this test led to cats becoming extremely ill—especially those with other serious diseases. Due to the risks shown in previous cases, this test is largely out of favor for diagnosing diabetes insipidus in cats. Treatment will depend on whether the cat is diagnosed with the CDI or NDI form of diabetes insipidus. For cats diagnosed with CDI, they can continue to take the Desmopressin for the duration of its life to reduce symptoms. It is important they are allowed 24/7 access to water, and can urinate freely. A veterinarian may recommend additional supportive therapy options. Pet parents should monitor cats treated with Desmopressin for signs of overhydration, which includes symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, difficulty breathing or changes in mentation. For cats diagnosed with NDI, it can be cured if the veterinarian is able to treat the primary underlying disease. Keep in mind, there is no cure for NDI of unknown causes, it can only be reversed if the primary disease is identified and treated. If the underlying condition is chronic, it may also trigger NDI relapses. Veterinarians will run a trial test with a drug called Desmopressin. This drug is a synthetic version of ADH that acts a replacement for the hormone. Before the drug is given, urine osmolality, or how many particles are dissolved in the urine and concentration will be measured before the drug is introduced. After the drug is administered and in the cat’s system, a pet parent will be asked to measure the urine output and water intake from the cat for a few days and continue to monitor its water and urination. Once urine samples are collected by the pet parent, your veterinarian will re-run the urine tests. A significant decrease in water intake and an increase in urine concentration of more than 50 percent are consistent with a diagnosis of CDI. Cats with NDI will not improve (which is how the NDI form will be suspected) and more testing may be necessary. Advanced imaging, such as MRI and CT scans, may also be used to help the vet evaluate the brain for cancer, lesions or trauma. The prognosis for diabetes insipidus is generally good, depending on the underlying disorder. NDI can be cured, while CDI is usually not curable unless the cause is due to trauma or is only temporary. Cats can live relatively normal lives with some forms of diabetes insipidus if the side effects of thirst and urination are manageable for the pet parent. Cats with diabetes insipidus, especially those untreated, must always have access to water. If not, severe dehydration, stupor, coma, and death may occur. For pets on Desmopressin or other medications, they will most likely require lab work on a regular basis to evaluate kidney function, urine concentration and electrolytes. Diabetes in cats is caused by the body’s lack of response—or lack of secretion of ADH, an antidiuretic hormone. Diabetes insipidus is extremely rare in cats. Some felines can be cured, but not all forms of diabetes insipidus can be reversed.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_diabetes_with_ketoacidosis,Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) in Cats,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency caused by severe complications of diabetes mellitus . Diabetes mellitus is caused by a decrease of insulin resulting in the inability of glucose in the bloodstream to move into the cells and tissues of the body. Without glucose, the cells and tissues essentially starve since they have no energy or food source. Although there is a large amount of glucose circulating in the bloodstream, it cannot be utilized without insulin. This is why diabetic patients will show high blood-sugar levels on a glucometer (a measure of high glucose circulating in the bloodstream) because glucose cannot enter the cells where it is needed. DKA occurs when a diabetic patient develops a secondary medical condition that places additional stress on the cells and the body. The most common secondary medical conditions include: Pancreatitis Any infection (most commonly urinary tract infection) Fatty liver (hepatic lipidosis) Kidney disease Cancer These conditions increase the body’s energy needs, which causes a spike in glucose demand. At this point, the body becomes desperate for energy and will start breaking down fat to acquire an energy source. This process leads to the conversion of fat to ketone bodies, which the cells and tissues can use as an alternative energy source. However, they create pH and electrolyte imbalances that result in acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and dehydration. Unless the normal fuel process is quickly restored (insulin providing glucose to the cells instead of ketones), the body will spiral into a metabolic turmoil that can quickly become life threatening. Because diabetes often goes undiagnosed in cats, the symptoms of DKA are often the first indication of this underlying condition. A pet can be diabetic (diagnosed or undiagnosed) and not show any symptoms of DKA until a secondary stressor or additional illness develops. If a known diabetic cat is sick with acute vomiting and/or anorexia, the pet parent should have the cat evaluated by their veterinarian. Clinical signs of diabetic ketoacidosis in cats may include: Anorexia Nausea/vomiting Lethargy/depression/weakness Increased drinking/increased urinating Increased respiratory rate which can progress to slow, deep breathing (from acidosis) Weight loss Dehydration Unkempt coat/lack of grooming Sweet smell to the cat’s breath DKA occurs when a diabetic patient develops a secondary medical condition that places additional stress on the cells and body. This increases the energy needs of the cell and tissues, which results in the body turning to ketones as an energy source. Some of the common causes include: Unregulated diabetes mellitus (not getting enough insulin) Pancreatitis Any infection (most commonly urinary tract infection ) Fatty liver (hepatic lipidosis) Kidney disease Neoplasia/Cancer Any other secondary medical condition that increases metabolic needs or stresses the body Diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis will begin with a physical examination by your veterinarian. If the pet is a known diabetic, the veterinarian may already be suspicious of DKA. The ketones may also cause a sweet smell to the pet’s breath. The veterinarian will want to run bloodwork, including a serum chemistry and complete blood count to assess blood sugar and electrolytes. Urinalysis will be useful to determine if there are signs of glucose and ketones in the urine and to rule out urinary tract infection. Ketones may also be found in the blood serum. Once the pet is determined to be diabetic and their blood shows the presence of ketones, the focus moves to determining what disease could be occurring in addition to the diabetes that led to the DKA. At this point, the pet will likely be transferred to a 24-hour specialty/emergency hospital for advanced diagnostics and possible hospitalization. The veterinary staff will likely perform an abdominal ultrasound to assess the pancreas for signs of inflammation (pancreatitis), assess the liver, kidneys and other organ systems of signs of disease or tumors. Chest X-rays may also be considered to rule out any evidence of pneumonia (source of infection) or metastasis (evidence of cancer). Finally, a blood-gas analysis may be performed to determine the severity of the acidosis. There are three main goals in treatment of DKA: Restore hydration through fluids Restore glucose as the main energy source through insulin therapy Stop ketone production, and correct electrolyte abnormalities To accomplish these goals, most cats will require hospitalization for at least a few days but might be hospitalized longer. An IV catheter will be used to provide IV fluid therapy for rehydration as well as electrolyte replacement. Initially, the patient will receive short-acting insulin and transitioned back to their normal long-acting insulin for discharge and at-home management. Blood sugar and electrolyte levels will be checked frequently during your cat’s hospital stay. Other medications for nausea, vomiting, pain or infection (antibiotics) may also be administered. One important aspect of DKA management is nutrition. For a diabetic pet to be successful at home they need to eat without vomiting to receive insulin and prevent DKA from recurring. In the hospital, blood-sugar levels will be closely monitored and insulin can be adjusted frequently. But at home, cats will need to eat twice per day and receive long-acting insulin. Since cats often refuse to eat during a hospital stay, it is important a cat eats when transitioning back home to ensure they get their insulin. In some cases, cats with DKA will need a temporary feeding tube to provide nutritional support to help with the transition. Your veterinarian will help you in understanding the type of feeding tube needed, and how to successfully use at home, should your cat need one. If your cat has previously been free fed, you will want to work with your veterinarian to transition them to meal feedings. If your cat does not eat, please contact your veterinarian immediately to discuss how to proceed with their insulin administration. Giving insulin, if a pet has not eaten without instructions from your veterinarian, can result in low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) and seizures. Early diagnosis and treatment of DKA are important for best possible outcome and minimal complications; however, most cats will need to remain hospitalized anywhere from two to seven days and placed on IV fluids, anti-nausea medications, electrolyte supplements, IV insulin therapy and other supportive care. Cats are typically discharged once they are eating on their own with no vomiting and can receive long-acting insulin at home. Once the immediate concerns and risks associated with DKA have been corrected (including stopping dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and eliminating ketones) the focus shifts to regulating and managing the diabetes mellitus and any concurrent illness. There is no cure for feline diabetes mellitus, but the prognosis is positive for quality of life. For most cats, this will mean twice daily long-acting insulin administration for life. This is much more likely for cats that do not go into diabetic remission (meaning they are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels without insulin injections). Long-term diabetes management is individualized for each cat by the veterinarian but it will likely include periodic glucose curves or fructosamine blood tests to ensure that the diabetes is properly regulated. Avoiding future DKA involves careful monitoring of your cat at home. If a known diabetic cat is sick with acute vomiting and/or anorexia, take it to a veterinarian immediately. Warning signs will include consistent vomiting, refusal to eat, increased drinking, consistent urination, weight loss and lethargy. Yes. Medication will be used to help with dehydration, nausea and electrolyte imbalances. Insulin will be a crucial part of the acute management of DKA and chronic management of diabetes mellitus. A cat can recover from DKA and go back to successful diabetic management.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_clostridial_enterotoxicosis,Diarrhea Due to Clostridium perfringens in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Clostridium perfringens bacterium is a normal bacteria found in the environment, commonly inhabiting decaying vegetation and marine sediment, as well as raw or improperly cooked meats and poultry. However, when abnormally high levels of this bacteria is found in the intestine, it can lead to Clostridial enterotoxicosis. Generally, the implications of the intestinal syndrome are limited to infections of the intestinal tract and do not progress to systemic disease conditions. Symptoms typically last a week in acute cases and include diarrhea , abdominal pain, and nausea. Long-term (chronic) cases of clostridial enterotoxicosis, meanwhile, involve recurrences of diarrhea, which may repeat every two to four weeks, and may continue for months to years. When compared to its incidence in dogs , this is an uncommon condition in cats. Most animals have antibodies that will effectively fight the bacteria and clear it from the body. Clostridial enterotoxicosis is caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria Clostridium perfringens in the intestine. Often, the bacteria is acquired from the environment (e.g., flora) or as the result of eating raw, undercooked, or old meat. Other risk factors include: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition, such as time spent outdoors, rummaging through garbage or getting hold of old or uncooked meat, or being boarded at a kennel. Your veterinarian will conduct a thorough physical exam on your cat as well as standard blood work, including a complete blood count, chemical blood profile, and urinalysis. Most of these tests will return normal. Because this infection has obvious intestinal symptoms, a fecal sample will need to be taken for microscopic analysis. This intestinal disease is sometimes difficult to identify because there is no one good test for it. Often, false positive results will return as the result of interfering substances in the feces. Your veterinarian may also want to use an endoscope to visualize the interior of your cat's intestines, and possibly take a tissue sample. Treatment is generally simple, with outpatient care provided until your cat has recovered from the infection. In some cases, when diarrhea and/or vomiting has been severe and the animal has become dehydrated and low in electrolytes, fluid therapy will need to be administered in a hospital setting. Your veterinarian may prescribe a week’s worth of oral antibiotics if the Clostridium perfringens toxin is found. Cats that need to be treated for long-term cases of diarrhea may need to be given antibiotics for a longer period of time. Dietary management is also helpful in the treatment of this condition. High-fiber diets and diets formulated with prebiotic and probiotic ingredients (like lactobacillus) can help to balance and maintain the intestinal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. This disease is treated and managed in long-term cases by switching your pet to a high in fiber diet, which reduces Clostridium perfringens and enterotoxin production in the intestinal tract. Your veterinarian might also recommend that you supplement your cat's diet with psyllium, a soluble source of fiber. Prebiotic and probiotic diets might also be recommended by your veterinarian in order to try to maintain the normal balance of good bacteria in your cat's intestine. Fortunately, cats with good immune response will generally fight off the infection easily. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_food_reactions_gastrointestinal,Dietary Reactions in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Gastrointestinal symptoms due to food reactions involve abnormal symptoms to a particular diet. A cat that is experiencing a food reaction is unable to digest, absorb, or utilize a particular ingredient in the food. It is important to note that these reactions are not due to food allergies, which involve an immune reaction to a particular component of a diet. However, both food reactions and food allergy share common symptoms, causes, diagnostics, and even treatments, making it a challenge for the attending veterinarian to differentiate between the two. Reactions to a particular diet are often due to unknown causes, but they may be linked to a particular dietary ingredient, additive, or dietary compound. Also possible are reactions to the toxic effects of particular food contaminants (e.g., Salmonella) or to spoiled foodstuffs (e.g., mold/fungus). Cat of any age, breed or gender can be affected. Lactose intolerance is commonly diagnosed in adult cats. Siamese and Siamese cross cats are found to be at higher risk of food sensitivities. Symptoms may appear after adding a new foodstuff or source to your cat's diet. The clinical symptoms may subside in the fasted state (medically supervised) or within days of a new dietary change. Common symptoms of a dietary reaction include: In most cases of adverse dietary reactions, there is a history of sudden diet change. The cat may also be reacting to food additives, coloring, spices, or propylene glycol, etc. Other underlying factors include an inability to utilize certain component(s) in a food and toxicity due to contaminated and/or spoiled foods. Your veterinarian will take a detailed and comprehensive history from you, especially regarding the cat's diet. Diagnosis of food reactions can be a daunting task, as there are a number of other health problems that may produce a similar spectrum of symptoms. Moreover, there are other disorders that may occur with dietary intolerances, further complicating the diagnosis. Laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. However, the results of these tests are often found normal if no other underlying disease is present. Further testing may be required to exclude other diseases that may cause similar symptoms in cats. The most widely practiced diagnostic procedure involves dietary manipulation. In this procedure efforts are made to find out the specific culprit in the diet by minimizing the ingredients and additives. This can be done by feeding the affected cat home-cooked diets or special diet plans. Typically, within a few days of the new diet clinical symptoms will start improving in these patients. This can make it easier to determine the problematic dietary component in the individual cat. After an improvement in clinical symptoms has been confirmed, your veterinarian will try to find the particular offending ingredient by slowly adding various ingredients back into the diet. Your veterinarian may also use endoscopy, a method in which a small camera that is attached to a flexible tube is inserted into the actual space to be examined. In this way the internal structure of the intestines can be closely examined, and will allow your doctor to take a tissue sample from the intestine for laboratory testing. Abdominal X-rays can also be useful in excluding other diseases that may cause similar clinical symptoms. Cats with severe vomiting, diarrhea or other clinical symptoms may require hospitalization for intravenous fluid administration, antibiotics, and supportive care. In most cases, the cat does not need hospitalization. The cornerstone of a successful treatment plan is in identifying the offending dietary component and excluding it from the diet. If the problematic dietary component cannot be identified, your veterinarian will suggest and help you plan a nutritionally complete exclusion diet. A trial and error method can be employed if a confirmatory diagnosis cannot be achieved. Your veterinarian will devise a plan to include or exclude a particular dietary component and monitor the response. The prognosis of most patients is very good, especially if the offending dietary component has been identified. The major goal of therapy is to avoid the causative dietary component. If your cat has been diagnosed with food sensitivities, you will need to avoid feeding your cat food scraps or adding new foodstuffs without first consulting with your veterinarian. If your veterinarian has prescribed a specific diet, adherence to the prescribed diet is of utmost importance. Poor treatment response is commonly due to reduced owner compliance, such as when the cat's owner reverts to giving “treats.” Do not allow children or visitors to feed the cat without prior permission. Good owner compliance will ensure long-term improvement of the clinical symptoms. Image: Sergey Peterman via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_nasal_dermatoses,Diseases of the Skin on the Nose of the Cat,"PetMD Editorial Many diseases affect the skin on the noses of cats. This can include bacterial or fungal infections of the skin, or mites. These diseases may affect the bridge of the nose where there is hair, or the smooth part of the nose, where there is no hair. Often, it is the portion of the nose that has hair that is affected. In the case of systemic diseases like lupus or other autoimmune ailments, the whole muzzle is involved. Some systemic diseases cause the part of the nose where there is no hair to lose its pigment or develop ulcers. A rare condition caused by the sun, called solar dermatitis, also affects the areas of the nose not covered by hair. That area may become inflamed and even ulcerated. Most of these conditions are more likely to occur in kittens under a year of age, but skin cancers are more likely to occur in older cats. There are many different symptoms that may be seen in cats affected by nasal dermatoses, among them: Some factors or diseases that may cause nasal dermatoses include: Your veterinarian will take samples of skin from your cat’s nose to culture for bacteria and fungi. Biopsies and immune system tests will also be conducted. The underlying cause of the symptoms will determine the appropriate course of treatment.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_lens_luxation,Dislocated Eye Lens in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Lens luxation is the total dislocation of the lens from its normal location. It occurs when the lens capsule separates 360° from the zonules (the fiber-like processes that extend from the ciliary body to the capsule of the lens of the eye) that hold the lens in place. If it occurs at the front of the eye, it comes forward through the pupil into the front chamber. If it goes to the back (posterior), it goes into the posterior segment/vitreous chamber. Secondary luxation, the most common type of lens luxation diagnosed in cats, may result from long term inflammation within the eye, neoplasia (tissue growth) within the eye, or stretching of the eye globe. This secondary form of the condition can occur in any age or breed of cat. There are four main types of lens luxation: The following signs and symptoms may be observed if your pet is suffering from lens luxation: There may be a variety of factors that lead to lens luxation in cats. For example, a tumor in the eye may physically move the lens out of position or cause chronic inflammation, leading to zonular degeneration. The inheritence pattern of primary luxation is uncertain, but it may occur concurrently with primary glaucoma in some breeds. Trauma rarely causes a normal lens to luxate, though it can occur when there are signs of severe uveitis, especially chronic lens-induced uveitis, or hyphema . Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ophthalmological exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Uveitis, glaucoma, and nodular granulomatous episclerokeratitis (inflammatory masses) can also cause painful, red eyes with corneal swelling and may be concurrent with lens luxation. Buphthalmia, enlargement of the eyeball caused by excess fluid within the eyeball, may cause lens luxation; it is usually differentiated from primary lens luxation by history. Corneal endothelial dystrophy or degeneration (opacity of the cornea) may also cause corneal swelling, making it difficult to see the intraocular structures. Diagnosis is made by careful ophthalmic examination and a history of the symptoms. Visual diagnostic techniques may be used to diagnose the cause of the luxation. Thoracic X-rays and abdominal ultrasound may be indicated if the luxation is secondary to an intraocular (within the eye) tumor, and ocular ultrasonography is useful if corneal edema (swelling) or cloudy ocular media prevent a useful examination. If your cat still has the potential for at least partial vision, the eyes may be best treated by removing the lens using a procedure called intraocular lens prosthesis. Occasionally, topical miotic ( constriction of the pupil of the eye) therapy can keep a posteriorly luxated lens behind the pupil and the need for surgery can be prolonged. Irreversibly blind eyes can be treated by evisceration ( removal of the internal material from the eye ), or by enucleation with intrascleral prosthesis — removal and subsequent replacement of the eye with an artificial eye. If the condition is secondary to cancer, enucleation is the best choice for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. After treatment, your cat should be re-examined immediately after the first 24 hours and every three months thereafter. Your doctor may want to refer you to an opthalmological veterinarian for evaluation, as intracapsular lens extraction — removal of the entire lens and its capsule — is also indicated for posterior luxations in order to decrease the chance for retinal detachment and chronic uveitis. A specialist can also examine for secondary glaucoma and retinal detachment. Unfortunately, there is a possibility that the lens luxation may affect both eyes if it hasn't already.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_keratoconjunctivitis_sicca,Dry Eye Syndrome in Cats,"Dry eye is the common name for Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), a medical condition caused by poor tear production that leads to inflammation of the outer layer of the eye, the cornea, and the surrounding tissues. Tears are necessary to keep the cornea moist and to remove debris from the eye. A cat’s lacrimal gland (located at the top outer edge of the eye) and third eyelid gland produce a film of tears that is a mixture of mucous, water, and oils/fats. KCS reduces the ability of these glands to produce enough tears, resulting in chronic dry eyes. Excessive blinking Squinting due to pain and discomfort Discharge from the eyes—usually cloudy white, yellow, or green Redness of the outer layer of the eye due to inflammation of the blood vessels Swelling of the conjunctiva, the tissue that lines the surface of the eye and the inner eyelids Elevation of the third eyelid Scarring or cloudiness of the cornea Dull appearance to the eyes Impaired vision or blindness (in severe cases where scarring is extensive) The cause of chronic dry eye in cats can depend on different underlying conditions or traumatic events that may have impacted the cat’s eye. The most common causes of dry eye syndrome in cats include: Viral infections, such as the feline herpes virus Immune diseases that damage the tear-producing glands Bacterial infections, such as chlamydia Anesthesia, which may temporarily reduce tear function Medications A disorder of the central nervous system caused by head trauma, brain tumor, or inner ear disease (rare in cats) Surgeries where the third eyelid is removed or damaged A direct radiation beam hitting the eye during radiographs or radiation therapy The vet will perform a physical examination of your cat, including a thorough eye exam. During the appointment, it’s important to share any history of symptoms as well as incidents that might have led to dry eye. In its early stages, dry eye syndrome in cats can be hard to diagnose from a physical examination alone. It may resemble other problems, like conjunctivitis or inflammation of the tissues of the eye. In early stages of a diagnosis it’s very common for the condition to be treated with these conditions in mind. However, if symptoms persist and decreased nasal secretions are also noted, the vet will measure tear production with a procedure called the Schirmer Tear Test (STT). This test involves putting a strip of special paper inside the cat’s lower eyelid and then noting how much fluid the paper absorbs. A culture of the tear film may be performed to investigate any bacterial overgrowth on the outer layer of the eye, as secondary infections are common in severe cases of dry eye. Fluorescein stain, or corneal staining, is often performed to identify any ulceration of the cornea. It’s performed with a special ophthalmic instrument and blue light in a dark room. Additional diagnostic tests or procedures that may be performed include: Intraocular pressure test to determine whether glaucoma is present Tear duct examination Flushing to ensure normal tear drainage through the nostrils The goal of treatment for dry eye syndrome in cats is to stimulate tear production and replace the tear film that protects the cornea from damage. There are 3 commonly used medications to assist with treatment: Cyclosporine (brand name Optimmune® ), a drug used to prevent organ-transplant rejections in humans, is also used to treat certain immune diseases in cats. When applied as an eye drop or ointment, it suppresses immune destruction, and tear production is improved. This medication is considered the primary therapy for dry eye syndrome in cats. Tacrolimus is another immune-system-related medication. It’s often tried in medical cases that don’t respond to or respond poorly to cyclosporine. Pilocarpine , a drug that works on the nervous system, can be useful in treating cases of nervous-system-related dry eye in cats. Other remedies your vet may suggest include: Artificial tear solutions : These are often used in combination with a tear-production stimulant, such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus, to replace the tear film. Drops may be administered every 2-6 hours, depending on the severity of the condition. Artificial tear solutions can be purchased over-the-counter at most pharmacies. Topical antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications : These will be used to treat underlying infection and inflammation, if noted during physical examination and diagnostic testing. Gently cleaning the eyes several times a day with a warm, wet washcloth : This can help soothe your cat and may help stimulate tear-film production. Parotid duct transpositioning : This surgery, often by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist or a veterinarian who is skilled with this delicate procedure, reroutes ducts from the saliva-producing glands in such a way that saliva is delivered to the eyes in place of tears. There is a significant risk of complication, so the surgery should only be pursued when all other options have failed. Saliva can be irritating to the cornea, and some cats are uncomfortable after surgery and require ongoing medical therapy. Depending on your cat’s diagnosis your veterinarian will be able to determine the best treatment option. You may be asked to return to the vet every 3-4 weeks after the onset of tear production therapy. Once tear production is improving, visits are recommended every 2-4 months until clinical signs stabilize, and about every 6 months thereafter. Increased tear production can occur immediately after starting tear-production medications, although in some cats, it may take several weeks. Diseases of the immune system usually require lifelong treatment. Other types may be transient and require treatment only until tear production returns. The prognosis is good for most cats with dry eye syndrome. Most cats can enjoy a happy, comfortable life with appropriate monitoring and diligent therapy. However, if the condition is diagnosed late in the course of the disease and scarring of the cornea has developed, cats may not respond well to therapy or regain their sight. Once corneal scarring has developed, there is little that can be done to reverse it. It’s critical to follow your vet’s treatment plan to increase the likelihood of a successful outcome for your cat. There is no breed of cat that has been proven to be more susceptible to dry eye syndrome. However, Burmese cats are more prone to prolapsed third eyelids (cherry eye), and if inappropriate surgical correction is performed, dry eye syndrome can develop. It’s not curable in most cases, but the condition is treatable. Lifelong therapy may be required. Cats do not seem to need as much tear film as dogs do to be comfortable during blinking. However, with more chronic and severe cases, this condition can be very painful. This becomes obvious when cats are squinting, blinking excessively, or rubbing their eyes. Over-the-counter artificial tear solutions are a good option to keep your cat’s eyes lubricated, but these will not stimulate tear production. It’s important to discuss any over-the-counter medications with your veterinarian first before administering to your cat.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/ears/c_ct_ceruminous_gland_adenocarcinoma,Ear Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma is the primary malignant tumor of the sweat glands found in the external auditory canal. Though rare, it is one of the most common malignant tumor of the ear canal in older cats. And while it may be locally invasive, it has a low rate of distant metastasis (spreading of the cancer). In addition, there is no known gender predisposition for this type of tumor, but it is more common in cats than dogs . Similar to otitis externa , cats with ceruminous gland adenocarcinoma exhibit vestibular signs such as dizziness, tilting of the head , uncoordination, and frequent stumbling or falling. Local lymph node enlargement may also be seen. Other symptoms depend on the stage of the cancer. Early stages of nodular masses: Later stages: Experts are still uncertain of the exact cause for this type of adenocarcinoma, but chronic inflammation may play a role in tumor development. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. Your doctor will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC), and an electrolyte panel. Radiographic and CT (computed tomography) imaging are essential to confirming the diagnosis. Skull X-rays, for example, can help to determine if the tympanic bullae (the bony extension of the temporal bone in the skull) are involved in the mass. And thoracic X-rays and CT scans help identify if the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other organs. A tissue sample for biopsy will be essential for determining the exact nature of the growth. Ear canal ablation (complete removal of the ear and ear canal) and lateral bulla osteotomy (removing the bony part of the ear canal) are preferred over lateral ear resection (removal of the majority of the ear). This is because these methods may extend your pet's survival time by three to four times when compared with lateral ear resection, which is typically only ten months. On large masses or those found to difficult to remove, radiotherapy should be performed. Unfortunately, there is a poor prognosis associated with extensive tumor involvement and neurologic signs (dizziness, falling, head tilt, etc.). Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your pet 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, and 24 months after treatment for a routine physical exam and chest X-rays.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_squamous_cell_carcinoma_ear,Ear Cancer in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cats can be afflicted with several types of skin tumors, even on their ears. One type of tumor that can affect the ears is a squamous cell carcinoma. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be described as a malignant and particularly invasive tumor that takes hold in the scale like cells of the epithelium – the tissue that covers the body or lines the cavities of the body. These scale-like tissue cells are called the squamous. Carcinoma is, by definition, an especially malignant and persistent form of cancer, often returning after is has been excised from the body and metastasizing to other organs and locations on the body. An auricular (relating to the ear) squamous cell carcinoma may be caused by excess sun exposure. It is more common in white cats and in cats that have white ears. This type of tumor starts out as red, crusty looking areas on the tips of the ears. The sores, or ulcers, may seem to come and go and will slowly get bigger with time. There may be ulcers on the face as well. This type of cancer can be treated successfully if it is caught early. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Be sure to describe any sores that have been apparent on other parts of the body, even if you suspect they were caused by injuries resulting from outdoor activity, or from scratching at the skin. During the examination, your veterinarian will look carefully for other sores or tumors on your cat's body. The lymph nodes will be carefully felt to determine if they are enlarged, an indication that the body is reacting to an infection or invasion. A sample of lymph fluid may be taken to test for cancerous cells. Your veterinarian will order complete blood count and biochemistry profile to make sure your cat's other organs are working normally and to determine whether the white blood cell count is higher than normal; again, an indication that the body is fighting an invasive disease or infection. A biopsy will be taken of the ulcerated tissue on your cat's ear so that your doctor can diagnose the specific type of growth it is, whether carcinoma or a benign mass of tissue. This is necessary for differentiating the ulcers from any other condition that could be causing the same symptoms. X-rays images of your cat's chest and skull will allow your veterinarian to visually inspect the lungs for signs of any abnormalities, especially tumors, and to make sure that the carcinoma has not spread into the bones. Treatment will depend on how many ulcers your cat has on its ears and how large the ulcers are. If there is only one small ulcer, it may be removed by cryosurgery, a freezing technique. If the ulcer is larger, or if there are several ulcers, it/they will be treated with surgery. During surgery, most or all of the upright part (pinna) of your cat's ear will be removed. In some cases, the ear canal may also need to be removed. Most cats recover well from this surgery, even if the ear canal needs to be removed. If surgery is not a practical option, chemotherapy may be used to kill the cancerous cells. However, chemotherapy is not usually as effective as surgery. In some cases, your veterinarian may recommend a veterinary cancer specialist so that you can determine if there are other viable treatment options. Once your cat has recovered from surgery, it should be able to lead a normal life. Your cat may look different, but it will adjust to its changed body. You will need to monitor your cat closely to make sure it does not develop new sores on its face or head. Try to limit the amount of time your cat spends out in the sun. If you must let your cat out during the daytime, you will need to apply sunscreen to areas of the body that have a thin hair coat. If your cat tends to spend a lot of time on the window sill, you might place a shade or reflector over the glass to block ultraviolet (UV) rays from reaching your cat. As with any cancer, it is recommended that you take your cat for regular progress check with your veterinarian. Limit the amount of time your cat spends in the sun, especially if it is white cat, or if it has a lighter hair coat. When your cat does go out in the sun, apply sunscreen to its ears and nose.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/c_ct_premature_labor,Early Contractions and Labor in Cats,"PetMD Editorial There are many conditions that can cause a pregnant cat, or queen, to experience premature contractions leading to preterm delivery of kittens. Bacterial infections, viral infections, death of one or more fetuses, ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalances, injury, malnutrition, a change in environment/moving, and basically any kind of stress that can send a cat into mental and physical distress can lead to early labor. In some cases, a cat may be genetically predisposed to preterm labor. Preterm delivery in cats is defined by a birth that occurs before the ideal 63 days of gestation. Generally, kittens born at 61 days of gestation, or later, have a high chance for survival. Stressful events: If you find that your cat is experiencing early labor you will want to consult with your veterinarian. You will need to begin by giving your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health before and during pregnancy, her onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have brought this condition on. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, while being careful not to bring on any further undue stress. Standard laboratory tests may include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to make sure that there are no underlying diseases that are causing the premature labor symptoms. The blood tests will show whether your cat's progesterone levels are abnormally low. Ultrasound imaging will be performed to diagnose fetal death or abnormal position of fetuses, which may cause a difficult delivery. However, an ultrasound can also give your veterinarian a visual on the fetal heartbeats along with more fetal detail. If the kittens are stillborn, or if they die shortly after birth, they should be necropsied by your veterinarian to determine the cause of death. If your cat is going into labor early, immediately contact your veterinarian or call the nearest emergency veterinarian for guidance. Your cat will most probably require medical treatment, either for an illness or to remove stillborn fetuses. If your cat is pregnant you should not expose your cat to other animals in the three weeks before delivery and in the three weeks after giving birth. Even animals that have been living in your own house in close proximity with your cat should be segregated from your cat during this vulnerable time. As much as possible, keep your cat isolated in a warm, quiet room, where she can create a nesting area for herself and her kittens. Some cats feel the need to hide in a closet or secluded spot, while others have no problems giving birth out in the open. If you can, provide both options to your cat. Do not give your cat any medications during pregnancy without first consulting with your veterinarian. This includes flea medications and vaccinations. If your veterinarian is treating your cat for anything, make sure to tell the doctor that your cat is pregnant. For example, you may allow your veterinarian to deworm your cat while it is pregnant, as long as you inform your veterinarian about the pregnancy. Do not board your cat or otherwise move it during pregnancy unless you have no other option. If your cat has bloody vaginal discharge while still preterm, call your veterinarian for advice immediately. You may want to consider taking your cat to the veterinarian for a pregnancy check-up at 30 days of pregnancy to confirm the pregnancy is progressing as it should. Most of the same precautions regarding medicines and vaccination hold true for the time following birth, while your cat is nursing her kittens. Always consult with your veterinarian before giving your cat anything that might make its way into her bloodstream and milk. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/ear-mites-cats,Ear Mites in Cats,"Lubo Ivanko/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Ear mites, scientifically known as Otodectes cynotis, are common among cats of all ages. They are especially prevalent in kittens and outdoor cats. These mites are highly contagious and can spread frequently among cats and dogs during close contact. Ear mites burrow into the ear canals, causing extreme irritation and inflammation. Pets who are infested usually experience itching , head shaking, and abnormal ear discharge . Although ear mites in cats can cause extreme discomfort, they are not typically life-threatening. However, if left untreated, they can cause secondary bacterial infections , pain , and severe inflammation in the ear canals. In severe cases, this can progress to rupture of the ear drum and hearing loss . If you notice thick ear debris and your cat is scratching their ears more than normal, promptly bring them to a veterinarian to determine the underlying cause. Symptoms of ear mites in cats can include: Thick, dark ear debris Ear pain Head shaking Frequent scratching of ears Tilting of the head Strong odor of the ear Hair loss around the ears and eyes Lethargy Decreased appetite Cats get ear mites from coming into close contact with another animal who has them. Ear mites are highly contagious and spread quickly among housemates, including other cats and dogs. Kittens commonly contract ear mites from their mother. Cats who are not kept up-to-date on monthly preventatives are especially at risk for getting ear mites if they are exposed. While indoor cats can be affected, ear mites tend to be more common in cats who are allowed outside, due to their increased risk of exposure to other infested animals and the environment. Cats with symptoms of ear mites should be seen by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis. Pet parents will be asked if their cat is on any monthly preventatives, if there are any other pets in the household, and if their cat spends any time outdoors. A veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam, paying close attention to the cat’s ears using a special instrument called an otoscope. Typically, if the veterinarian finds debris in the cat’s ears that look like coffee grounds, ear mites are highly likely. However, ear cytology (the microscopic examination of cells) can be used to support a diagnosis and is done for two reasons: To check for mites : A veterinarian uses a cotton swab to gently remove material from the ear, adds it to a small amount of oil, and views it under the microscope. Ear mites and their eggs are easily viewed this way. To check for a bacterial infection : Material from the ear is rolled onto a slide via a cotton swab. The slide is then stained and examined under a microscopic to check for bacteria. Secondary bacterial infections in the ear canal are common among cats with ear mites. Cats require treatment to get rid of ear mites. An ear cleanser, such as Epi-Otic® Advanced , should be used daily to remove excess debris during this treatment period. There are two main options for treating ear mites in cats: Topical drops : These can be administered directly into the ear canal to kill mites. Examples of effective medications are milbemycin and ivermectin. Flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives : These medications are applied to the cat’s skin in between the shoulder blades and are effective in killing ear mites after a single dose. Examples include those from Revolution ® and Advantage Multi ™. If a bacterial infection is also present in the ear canal, a topical antibiotic ointment will be used alongside mite treatment. In cats with severe ear inflammation, topical or oral steroids—such as prednisolone—may be prescribed. Because ear mites are quickly spread during close contact, all pets in the household should be treated by a veterinarian. Cats typically recover from ear mites after a single course of topical treatment, as long as pet parents closely follow their veterinarian’s instructions on how to clean the ears and apply the medication. Elimination of mites takes about a month, but cats generally start to feel better just a couple of days after beginning treatment. It’s also important that pet parents bring their cat back to the veterinarian for a recheck appointment after completing treatment. This is to confirm that all ear mites have been eliminated and no additional treatment is necessary. An important way to prevent ear mites in cats is to apply topical flea, tick, and heartworm preventatives each month year-round. Additionally, keeping a cat’s ears clean through once-weekly ear cleansing prevents buildup that can create a favorable environment for ear mites. Since ear mites are highly contagious, healthy pets should be kept separate from infested ones until the mites have been eliminated. Keeping cats indoors can also reduce your cat’s risk of exposure to mites. Ear mites do not typically spread from cat to human. However, in rare instances, people living in a house with a cat who has ear mites can develop a rash if the mites jump onto their skin and bite it. Indoor cats can get ear mites, especially if they have been in close contact with an infested animal. There are no products that kill ear mites instantly. Several topical medication options kill mites after a single use, but full elimination of mites takes about one month.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/ehrlichiosis-cats,Ehrlichiosis in Cats,"Ehrlichiosis is a rare, poorly understood tick-borne disease that affects the blood cells of cats. Ehrlichia, the bacteria that causes ehrlichiosis, is a Rickettsial disea se. These are typified by bacteria that only live inside other cells, causing disease in dogs, cats, and humans. The disease in cats is called feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis . It is unclear which tick s transmit Ehrlichia to cats, but most likely they are similar to the brown dog tick that transmits a similar condition in dogs. These ticks become infected by feeding on diseased hosts. Ticks require multiple hosts throughout their life cycle, including rodents, white-tailed deer, dogs, and cats. Ehrlichia can be transmitted to cats as quickly as three hours after a tick becomes attached. Bacteria enter the cat through the bite wound and saliva. Once in the bloodstream, the Ehrlichia bacteria infects and reproduces in the cat’s white blood cells, spreading through tissues. This can create problems with white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, and cause disease in organs throughout the body. While dogs with ehrlichiosis experience three stages of the disease, this does not appear to occur in cats. They may have co-infections with other viruses and tick-borne diseases, which will lead to worsening clinical signs. Symptoms of feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis vary greatly. Common symptoms include: Fever Lethargy Decreased appetite Pale mucous membranes (gums) Bruising and bleeding Vomiting Diarrhea Joint pain Uveitis (inflammation in the eye) Enlarged lymph nodes Weight loss Difficulty breathing Enlarged spleen, which may make the abdomen appear enlarged Nervous system issues (meningitis, brain bleeds) A tick acquires ehrlichiosis after feeding on an infected host. Most ticks that cause tick-borne disease require three hosts throughout their life to reproduce and complete their life cycle. These hosts include rodents, rabbits, deer, foxes, dogs, and cats. Once a tick is infected, it transmits the disease to cats through a bite as it feeds on the cat’s blood. The bacteria appear in the bloodstream and white blood cells a few weeks after the tick feeds. Veterinarians may suspect a tick-borne disease, such as ehrlichiosis, based on clinical history and symptoms. However, because ehrlichiosis is extremely rare, other causes for clinical signs should be thoroughly evaluated. Blood work plays a major role in diagnosing ehrlichiosis, as well as side effects and complications. Diagnostic tests include: Blood chemistry Complete blood count : Cats with ehrlichiosis commonly have low platelets, anemia, and increased monocytes (a certain white blood cell). Blood smear : Ehrlichia organisms may be visualized in white blood cells, but it is rare to find them in the peripheral blood. Serology and PCR assays : For Ehrlichia, these tests can be used for definitive diagnosis but may cross-react with other rickettsial species, causing the possibility for false positives and negatives. X-ray s : These may be taken to rule out fractures or other causes of joint pain. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for cats with confirmed or suspected feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis. Most cats respond rapidly, within days. Cats are treated for suspected ehrlichiosis for at least 28 days. Owners should use caution when using doxycycline in cats. In tablet form, it can cause esophageal strictures— narrowing scar-like formations in the esophagus—if it gets stuck. Many veterinarians use liquid doxycycline or follow the tablet with a good amount of water. If your cat does not respond appropriately, other diagnoses should be considered, or different antibiotics like tetracycline or imidocarb may be prescribed. During acute illness, depending on the severity of clinical signs, cats may require supportive care, including: Intravenous fluid therapy Nutritional support Pain management Blood transfusions Overall, the prognosis for cats with feline mononuclear ehrlichiosis is good. Cats should show signs of initial improvement over three days, but complete recovery may take longer based on the severity of the disease. Antibiotics are usually administered for a full month, sometimes longer. While most cats respond favorably, some do not recover and die or are euthanized due to the disease. Common long-term complications include chronic arthritis , ocular issues, anemia , and side effects from blood transfusions. Veterinarians may recommend rechecking bloodwork to ensure complete removal of the organism 1-2 months after treatment. If the results are still positive and the cat is still symptomatic, a second round of antibiotics may be required. There is no vaccine to prevent ehrlichiosis in dogs or cats. Tick avoidance and prevention is critical to ensure the safety of pets. There are a variety of tick preventives on the market , and your veterinarian can help you make the best choice for your pet. Be sure to check your pet for ticks and remove any you find. Ehrlichia is zoonotic, which means it can infect humans. It’s important to note that cats cannot transmit Ehrlichia directly to their owners; an infected tick would need to bite a human. But dogs and cats can bring unattached ticks in from outside. Ensure that your cat is up to date on tick prevention, and check your cat for ticks whenever they come in from outside. Ticks are small ectoparasites, some only a few millimeters in size. When feeding, they become engorged and swell to several times their original size. They are in the arachnid family and therefore have eight legs in their adult form. Veterinary staff can remove the tick for you. At home you can use a tool called the Tick Tornado to fully remove these pests. Do not use a match or a flame, as you could injure yourself or your cat. A cat may bring an unattached tick into the home that could bite a human and transmit ehrlichiosis. However, your cat cannot directly transmit the disease to you. Côté E, Ettinger S, Feldman E.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/traumatic/electrocution-cats,Electrocution in Cats,"Electrocution in cats is almost always accidental and fortunately not that common. But when it occurs, the effects can be quite devastating, even fatal. Electrocution is considered a medical emergency and often occurs when cats chew on an electrical cord or wire . The electrical energy from the cord passes through the body, which leads to tremors, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) , breathing difficulties, shock , and changes in the nervous system. After an injury to the nervous system, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) can often happen due to changes in pressure and the release of certain chemicals and chemical agents in the cat’s body. It is important to note that pulmonary edema can occur hours after the initial injury, which is why it is critical to seek veterinary treatment immediately , even if your cat seems fine. The severity of injuries can vary based on the type of electrical current, its strength, time of exposure, and resistance to it. The most common cause of electrocution in cats occurs from biting or chewing wires. Cats can also experience electrical injuries from contact with exposed wires, faulty circuits, or being struck by lightning. Even though all cats can suffer from electrical injuries, kittens and younger cats, often due to their inquisitive nature and teething behavior, will more commonly experience electrocution from chewing wires. If you witness the electrocution, you will probably see your cat collapse, convulse, or develop muscle tremors. Her whiskers or facial hair may be singed, and there will most likely be burns on her lips, tongue, palate, and teeth. If not witnessed, symptoms of electrocution can appear as the following: Apnea (lack of breathing) Bluish gums and mucous membranes (lips, nose) Coughing Decreased appetite or trouble swallowing Fractures to the teeth Increased heart rate Lethargy Oronasal fistulae (holes that develop between the mouth and nasal cavity) Respiratory distress—faster respiratory rate than normal; breathing with the whole body; or open-mouth breathing (panting) Seizures or tremors Sudden collapse and death Thankfully, electrical cord injuries are uncommon, but when they occur, the effects are often serious. The first thing to do if you notice the electrocution or find your cat near an exposed wire is to turn off the electrical power or circuit breaker. Do not touch your cat until you are sure there is no active electrical current. Second, evaluate your cat, looking for signs of consciousness, breathing, and a heartbeat. Your cat requires prompt medical evaluation even if she appears fine, because life-threatening complications can develop later. Treatment of electrical injuries in cats is often individual, based upon the severity of symptoms and degree of injuries, though supportive care measures are mainly used, including: Oxygen therapy and pain management while minimizing stress are the most important and necessary steps for initial management. IV fluid therapy, careful use of diuretics, anti-arrhythmic drugs, muscle relaxers, and bronchodilators may be given, and some cats may require mechanical ventilation if respiratory problems are severe. Burns are often treated with basic wound care—cleaning and bandaging, then antibiotics and pain management. Oral antiseptic mouth rinses along with sucralfate , a medication often prescribed to treat stomach ulcers, may be used to aid in coating lesions in the mouth and esophagus associated from secondary thermal burns. Soft food or a gruel-type mixture may often be fed while the burns heal, and if the wounds are severe enough, a feeding tube may be warranted. Cats that receive prompt medical attention often have a good prognosis for recovery. Your cat will most likely need to be hospitalized and monitored for several days, as pulmonary edema often resolves in that timeframe, assuming no underlying permanent damage has occurred. Fortunately, most cats recover without any significant long-term damage. Some cats with extensive burns may require additional procedures aimed at wound healing, which may include surgery. The most effective way to prevent electrical injuries to your cat is to prevent access to wires. “Cat proofing” your home is always a best practice prior to adoption. Keep doors closed or use baby gates if cats have access to rooms with exposed wires. You should also consider products such as anti-chew wire covers to keep cats protected from exposed wires. Inspect cords for signs of wear and damage, then promptly get rid of exposed wires and unplug devices and cords when not in use. Additional steps to prevent injuries include anchoring cords to the wall with connectors or using a specially designed wire cover. Especially during holiday months when more lights, cords, and fans may be used, it is critical to keep cats away from all plugs and cords. Yes. Electrical injuries from lightning strikes or chewing on cords and wires can cause significant injury, including death. Yes. Chewing on cords is by far the most common cause of electrocution in cats. Ingestion of the wires or their plastic coating can also cause an intestinal obstruction. Most cats that receive prompt medical attention and show mild to moderate symptoms of electric shock can recover within a few days. The first 24–48 hours are the most critical, and cats that suffer extensive injury, have more prolonged contact with wires or cords, or receive higher currents often have poor outcomes.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hypophosphatemia,Electrolyte Disturbance in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A low concentration of phosphorus in the blood serum can be caused by shifts of phosphorus from the extracellular fluid (the fluid outside of the cells) into the body cells, reduced intestinal absorption of phosphorus, or reduced renal (kidney) phosphorus reabsorption. In patients that are being treated with insulin for diabetic ketoacidosis (a condition in which the body burns fatty acids and produces acidic ketone bodies in response to insulin shortage, or are undergoing refeeding with glycolysis (synthesized glucose) for treatment of starvation, a resulting rapid production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP, a nucleotide that transports chemical energy within cells) can lead to relocation of phosphorus into cells. If not diagnosed, it can further lead to acute extracellular hypophosphatemia (an electrolyte disturbance). Because phosphorus is an important component of ATP, low serum phosphorus concentration can cause ATP depletion and affect cells with high ATP-energy demands, such as red blood cells, skeletal muscle cells, cardiac muscle cells, and brain cells. A state of hypophosphatemia can also lead to a reduction in erythrocyte 2,3-DPG, resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. Symptoms are generally consistent with the primary disease that is responsible for the hypophosphatemia, rather than any that would be related to the phosphate concentration itself. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you have provided, and possible conditions that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis to determine the priority for treatment. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. If your cat is suffering from severe hypophosphatemia, your veterinarian will need to hospitalize the cat for immediate treatment. If the condition is caused by insulin therapy or intravenous nutrients and vitamins, these treatments will be suspended until supplemental phosphate has been administered for a few hours. If a condition of anemia is present, fresh whole blood transfusions may be required. Conversely, if your cat is only suffering a moderate case of hypophosphatemia, it may be treated on an outpatient basis as long as the cat's condition is stable. Your veterinarian will need to measure your cat's phosphorus levels every 6–12 hours until the concentration of phosphorous remains stable within the normal range. If hyperphosphatemia recurs, all supplementation will be stopped and your cat will be provided with intravenous fluid until the phosphorus levels return to normal. Follow-up care will include monitoring your cat's condition for acute (sudden and severe) renal failure, a condition that some hyperphosphatemic patients become more prone to, and monitoring potassium concentrations daily until they, too, are remaining stable.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/encephalitis-cats,Encephalitis in Cats,"Encephalitis occurs when the brain becomes inflamed; it is a life-threatening condition that must be treated as quickly as possible. In cats, encephalitis is often caused by an infection either directly to the brain or elsewhere in the body, reaching the brain via the bloodstream or nervous system. As a result, the brain swells, causing pain that often extends to the neck and other parts of the body. Confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness can occur as damage to the brain worsens. Encephalitis may occur by itself or with other parts of the nervous system, such as the spinal cord (encephalomyelitis) or the meninges (meningoencephalitis), which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Encephalitis in cats is not very common. It is seen more often in older cats, and there are no specific breeds predisposed to this condition. Your cat may experience vague symptoms that might not be noticeable right away, such as fever, lethargy, or a decreased appetite. Cats with encephalitis often experience symptoms related to dysfunction of the nervous system, such as: Generalized weakness and trouble walking Neck pain Behavioral changes (e.g., aggression, reclusiveness, depression) Seizures Visual deficits such as blindness Head tilting and circling Coma Death Most cases of encephalitis in cats result from these types of infections: Viral, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) or rabies Bacterial, such as Staphylococcus and Bacteroides spp . Tick-borne, such as Lyme Disease Parasitic, such as toxoplasmosis , heartworm disease , or roundworm infection Fungal, such as cryptococcosis Encephalitis in cats may also simply be caused by an infection spread from another part of the body, such as the ears or sinuses. Bite wounds or other traumatic injuries, foreign bodies, or immune-mediated cases where the body’s immune system attacks itself are other common causes of encephalitis. Your veterinarian usually conducts a physical exam and orders basic bloodwork such as a complete blood cell count (CBC), internal organ function screening, and urinalysis. The results from these tests are not sufficient to diagnose encephalitis, but they can suggest a neurologic condition resulting from an infection or inflammation. Additional tests may include chest x-rays and an abdominal ultrasound to look for other organ involvement and prognostic factors. Be sure to tell your veterinarian of any recent travel you have been on, as certain diseases are more common in certain parts of the U.S. than others, and it can help narrow down the causes of your cat’s disease. Your vet may also want to know your cat’s vaccination status to make sure she is protected from possible exposure to wild animals and other diseases. Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary neurologist for an MRI and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap, which are done under anesthesia. The MRI takes an image of your cat’s brain, and the CSF tap collects some of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord to be analyzed for signs of infection and inflammation. The sample may also be cultured to look for infectious organisms. In rare cases, a biopsy of the brain or a postmortem examination may be the only way to determine the nature of the disease. These cases may also be called “idiopathic” or “immune-mediated” when the cause of the disease is unknown. The first step in treating encephalitis in cats is to admit them to the hospital and give them pain medication, antibiotics, IV fluids, nutrition, and anticonvulsants. Once the test results return, treatment is tailored toward the cause: Antifungal medication such as Itrafungol for fungal infections Antibiotics such as clindamycin for certain protozoal and bacterial infections Immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisolone , cyclosporine , or lomustine for immune- mediated encephalitis Treatment often takes weeks to months, and in some cases, years. The prognosis of a cat suffering from encephalitis depends on the cause. Cats with immune-mediated encephalitis have a better prognosis despite needing lifelong treatment, whereas encephalitis caused by rabies will more likely result in death. For some cats, relapses can occur if treatment is weaned or discontinued. Discuss the risks and benefits of future vaccinations with your veterinarian, as relapses can occur after vaccinations. Cats with encephalitis may also require physical therapy or environmental modifications if permanent damage occurs. Unfortunately, some cats may die or are humanely euthanized despite treatment. There is no guarantee that your cat will not develop encephalitis in their lifetime. However, there are some steps you can take to minimize the risk —keep your cat indoors, vaccinate them, and promptly treat them for any infection, bite, or wound.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_gingival_hyperplasia,Enlarged Gums in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Gingival hyperplasia is a medical condition by which a cat's gingival tissue becomes inflamed and enlarged. Enlargement is typically caused by dental plaque or other bacterial growth along the gum line. This condition is relatively rare in cats, and in many cases can be prevented with good oral hygiene habits. Common symptoms of gum enlargement include: The most common cause of gingival hyperplasia is bacteria and plaque along the gum line. This disease will also affect the bones and the structures supporting the teeth. If left untreated, this condition can lead to periodontal disease. Gingival hyperplasia is often diagnosed during a veterinary mouth inspection. If there is a gingival mass present, a biopsy will be performed, with tissue taken from the mass for examination, so that cancer (neoplasia) can be either confirmed or ruled out. X-ray images will also be taken to rule out potentially serious underlying medical conditions. In some more serious cases, surgical repair and/or deep cleaning and re-contouring of your cat's gums may be performed to help return the gum line to its original shape and to return any formed pockets to normal. Pain medication will be given as needed to reduce discomfort for your cat. Overall, an in depth dental cleaning, along with oral antibiotics (antimicrobials) will be used to clean and repair your cat's gums, and to reduce the swelling and enlargement. It is important that you take your cat for routine dental cleanings, along with maintaining good oral hygiene, in order to prevent the formation or recurrence of enlarged gums. Animals with gingival hyperplasia generally will have a good outcome with treatment, although relapse is common. There are some potential complications with gum enlargement, including deeper pocket formation in the gums, which can encourage additional bacterial growth within the pockets.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/enlarged-heart-cats,Enlarged Heart in Cats,"YanaVasileva/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images An enlarged heart in cats is typically caused by dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Although DCM occurs infrequently in cats, it causes a devastating outcome in most cases. DCM causes the muscular part of the heart (myocardium) to become weak and unable to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body. Blood builds up in the heart, causing the walls of the heart to become thinner and the heart chambers to become enlarged. Over time, congestive heart failure develops. DCM most commonly affects the left side of the heart, causing fluid to build up in the lungs. As a result, affected cats typically show signs of respiratory distress, such as panting , increased respiratory rate , and coughing . In rare cases, right-sided heart enlargement may occur, which can lead to ascites , which is fluid in the abdomen. DCM can cause significant discomfort for cats , especially as the disease worsens. Cats in respiratory distress are considered to be experiencing a medical emergency and should be seen by a veterinarian immediately for treatment. Symptoms of an enlarged heart in cats include: Decreased appetite Increased respiratory rate Difficulty breathing Coughing Heart murmur Abnormal heart rhythm Weak pulse Decreased body temperature (hypothermia) Pale gums Distended abdomen Weakness Collapse Historically, an enlarged heart in cats was caused by a taurine deficiency . Taurine is an amino acid that is necessary for proper heart function in cats. Today, commercial pet food companies supplement their diets with taurine. Because of this, taurine-responsive DCM is rare, except in cats fed homemade diets without the appropriate amount of taurine. Rare cases of DCM have occurred in cats fed grain-free diets . Research to determine whether there is a correlation between the two is ongoing. Most current cases of DCM in cats are idiopathic, which means they result from an unknown cause. DCM is most common in middle-aged and older cats. The condition can affect all breeds, but Burmese , Abyssinian , and Siamese cats are diagnosed more frequently, most likely due to genetics. Male and female cats are equally likely to be affected. Diagnosis of an enlarged heart in cats begins with a though physical exam. Your veterinarian will listen carefully to your cat’s heart and lungs with a stethoscope to identify a heart murmur, abnormal heart rhythm, or unusual lung sounds. Heart and respiratory rates will be noted. Additional diagnostic tests that can be done include: Taurine levels —In cats fed a homemade or limited-ingredient diet, measuring taurine levels in the blood can help determine whether this nutritional deficiency is present. Electrocardiogram (EKG)—Electrodes are placed on a cat’s chest to track their heart rate and rhythm, which can be abnormal in cats with an enlarged heart. Chest X-rays —Images of your cat’s chest may be taken to identify heart enlargement or fluid in the lungs. Echocardiogram —An ultrasound of the heart allows a veterinarian to visualize the heart in real time as it pumps. An echocardiogram is the preferred test to diagnose DCM and is performed by a veterinary cardiologist. An enlarged heart in cats is not curable, and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms of heart failure. When cats are first diagnosed with this condition, they often need to be stabilized, which may involve the following treatments: Oxygen therapy —Supplemental oxygen can be administered to help cats breathe more easily. Thoracentesis —If your veterinarian suspects that fluid has built up in the chest, they may use a needle to drain the fluid. Diuretics —These medications can be given orally or by injection to remove excess fluid from the lungs and abdomen that has accumulated due to heart failure. Furosemide is the most common diuretic used for this purpose. Pimobendan — This medication is given orally to improve the heart’s pumping ability, so more blood is sent to the rest of the body. ACE inhibitors —These medications decrease blood pressure and help the heart pump blood more effectively. Examples include enalapril and benazepril. Taurine —Although heart enlargement due to taurine deficiency is rare, some cats may benefit from taurine supplementation. Anticoagulants —Cats in heart failure have an increased risk for developing blood clots. Giving an anti-clotting mediation, such as clopidogrel , can reduce this risk. An enlarged heart in cats is a terminal disease if it’s caused by a condition other than taurine deficiency. On average, cats diagnosed with non-taurine-responsive DCM live only 11 days after diagnosis. This is likely because DCM is a progressive disease and most affected cats are already in heart failure by the time they are seen by a veterinarian. Cats with an enlarged heart due to a taurine deficiency have a similarly poor prognosis during the initial treatment period. However, once taurine supplementation raises the concentration in the blood, most cats recover fully. It can take several months for a cat’s heart to return to normal in these cases. Because the cause of an enlarged heart in cats is typically unknown, it is difficult to prevent most cases. However, since taurine deficiency has been shown to contribute to this condition in the past, pet parents should feed their cats a commercial cat food rather than a homemade diet.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hepatomegaly,Enlarged Liver in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Due to certain diseases and conditions that can either directly or indirectly affect the liver's ability to function, the organ may increase in size, which is referred to as hepatomegaly. Kittens normally have larger livers in regard to their actual body mass, as compared to adult cats. However, hepatomegaly is most commonly diagnosed in older cats. Depending on the underlying cause, the enlargement may involve the whole liver or only part of the liver. For example, infections and/or inflammation may lead to a generalized symmetrical enlargement of the liver, whereas tumors, hemorrhages, cysts, or rotation of the liver lobe may lead to asymmetrical or focal enlargement. That is, only a part of the liver may be enlarged. Symptoms can vary depending on the cause. Enlargement of the abdomen is the most commonly observed symptom. On examination your veterinarian will find an enlarged liver or a palpable mass in the abdominal area. The mass is usually observed behind the rib cage and may even be visible with naked eye. However, in obese animals it is difficult to detect an enlarged liver on physical examination. You will need to give a detailed history of your cat’s health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems, and a complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of the routine laboratory tests are highly variable depending on the underlying cause of the liver enlargement. The complete blood count may reveal anemia, abnormal spherical red blood cells (spherocytes), disrupted red blood cells (schistocytes), red blood cells with spots due to hemoglobin accumulation (Heinz bodies), presence of parasites with red blood cells, immature white blood cells (blast cells) in the blood, red blood cells with nucleus, and abnormally low or high number of platelets (tiny cells used in blood clotting). The biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of liver enzymes, and a high cholesterol level. Further testing may include blood clotting profile as blood clotting abnormalities are common in patients with liver involvement. Your cat may also be tested for presence of heartworm disease. The abdominal X-rays may show an enlarged liver with rounded margins, or a displaced stomach and kidneys. The chest X-rays may help in determining any metastasis of a tumor to the chest cavity, and will also show diseases involving the heart and lungs. Abdominal ultrasonography can be used to view further details in the abdominal cavity, revealing changes in liver size and surface contour, as well as the presence of concurrent diseases. Abdominal ultrasound will also help in discriminating diffuse or localized types of liver enlargement. More advanced diagnostic tests, like electrocardiography and echocardiography, can be used to evaluate the structure and functions of heart. If tumors are seen or suspected, your veterinarian will want to take a sample of liver tissue in order to confirm either its benign or malignant nature, but even without a tumor present, a tissue sample can be helpful for determining the cause, severity and stage of the liver disease. The samples will be sent to laboratory for microbial cultures, and in case of infection, the culturing of the sample will help in determining the type of microorganism that is involved so that suitable drugs can be prescribed. Treatment is highly variable and will depend on the underlying cause. In case of heart involvement or advanced liver disease, your cat may need to be hospitalized for intensive treatment and supportive care. The aim of treatment is eliminate the inciting cause and prevent further complications. Broad spectrum antibiotics are given to the patients with infections. Dehydration is common in these patients and intravenous fluids are required for normalizing the fluid levels. Multivitamins are also given to maintain the healthy levels of vitamins. Some patients may also require surgical interventions to remove a tumor, abscess, or cyst. Patients with heart failure or excessive fluid in the abdomen require changes in feed and fluid intake. These patients need special care and often complete cage rest is recommended. Special diet considerations, like addition of high levels of proteins, restriction of salt, and adequate vitamin supplementation will be put in place for your cat. The prognosis is variable and depends on the underlying cause and duration of the disease. Some causes are less serious, while others are life-threatening in nature. As the liver is the central organ in the metabolism of drugs, you must not give any drug or change the dosage amount of any prescribed drugs without prior consultation with your veterinarian. In order to prevent negative energy balance, you will need to feed small and frequent meals to your cat. Your cat will need to be evaluated frequently during therapy. Your veterinarian will conduct laboratory testing and radiography as necessary to monitor your cat's progress. Image: Rommel Canlas via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/enlarged-spleen-cats,Enlarged Spleen in Cats,"AnnaStills/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images The medical term for an enlarged spleen in cats is feline splenomegaly. If your cat’s spleen is very large, their belly may have a bloated appearance. Otherwise, you commonly can’t tell from looking at your cat that they have an enlarged spleen in their abdomen. This can happen due to masses or nodules in the spleen, inflammation of the spleen, or a backup of blood into the spleen (congestion). Some, but not all, causes of splenic enlargement may cause pain or discomfort . A significant increase in size can put pressure on surrounding organs. While mild cases of splenic enlargement might occur relatively frequently, splenomegaly is not a very common medical problem in cats. If your cat is pale, collapsing , repeatedly vomiting , or yowling when their abdomen is touched, seek emergency care. Splenic enlargement is one of many possible causes of these emergency symptoms. The symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats aren’t specific to the condition. This means they could indicate a whole host of different things, and splenomegaly based on these symptoms alone is not enough for a diagnosis. Symptoms of an enlarged spleen in cats include: Poor appetite Lethargy Bloated abdomen Abdominal pain Vomiting or diarrhea Splenomegaly often occurs secondary to another condition, such as an infection. In these cases, your cat may have other symptoms that depend on the underlying cause. For example, a cat with an infectious cause might also have a fever , and a cat with an autoimmune cause like immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) might also have pale or jaundiced gums. Causes of enlarged spleen in cats can include: Cancers such as mast cell tumors or leukemia (which occur secondary to feline leukemia virus ) Infections such as cytauxzoonosis , feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) , histoplasmosis, or hemotropic mycoplasmosis Congestion (blood backing up into the spleen) due to sedatives or right-sided congestive heart failure (CHF) Nodular hypoplasia (sometimes occurs as a normal aging change) Extramedullary hematopoiesis (bone marrow isn’t working well so the spleen makes red blood cells) Splenic hematomas (solid swelling of clotted blood) A veterinarian might be able to feel an enlarged spleen in cats when they palpate (examine by touch) the abdomen. X-rays of the abdomen can also show an enlarged spleen. Ultrasonography of the abdomen allows for more detailed examination and can identify things like splenic masses, changes to the spleen’s architecture, or fluid in the abdomen that might be related to splenomegaly. Your veterinarian may recommend a procedure called a fine needle aspirate (FNA), which is the collection of a sample of cells acquired by putting a needle into the spleen and suctioning cells into the syringe. The cells are placed on a lab and examined under a microscope, often at a specialty lab. If your veterinarian recommends a splenic FNA, your cat will need to be sedated to prevent accidental laceration of the spleen, which could result in significant internal bleeding. Treatment of enlarged spleen in cats varies depending on the cause of splenomegaly. Some cases do not require treatment, such as splenic enlargement that occurs after administering sedatives. In some cases, such as a bleeding splenic hematoma, removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is an effective and curative treatment. If significant blood loss was associated with the splenic hematoma, the cat may also require a blood transfusion. Some infectious causes may be treated with antifungals or antibiotics. Other infectious causes of an enlarged spleen have a very poor prognosis, although some have a better outlook with early and aggressive treatment. With cancerous causes , treatment options include removal of the spleen (if the tumor is only in the spleen) and chemotherapy. Most malignancies affecting the spleen do not have a favorable long-term prognosis, but treatment can provide relief and prolong life. If your cat’s splenomegaly is secondary to cancer, they may be referred to a veterinary oncologist for specialized care. Recovery for an enlarged spleen in cats depends on why your cat’s spleen was enlarged. Some cases don’t affect their health and they can recover on their own. If your cat has an infectious cause, they may be hospitalized for several days. A lot of the infectious causes of enlarged spleen require prolonged administration of medications. For example, treatment for histoplasmosis involves administering antifungal medications for several months. You will have more frequent check-ins with the veterinarian to monitor progress. If your cat had surgery, you’ll want to keep them from licking their incision. Recovery cones, e-collars, or recovery suits may be a good option. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions for post-operative activity restrictions. Some causes of enlarged spleen in cats aren’t preventable. However, you can reduce the risk of infectious diseases that cause splenic enlargement by vaccinating your cat against feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and staying up to date on flea, tick, and heartworm preventives . Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations regarding frequency of wellness exams . Your veterinarian may be able to detect conditions before they develop symptoms.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_entropion,Entropion in Cats: What It Is and How to Treat,"iStock Entropion is a painful eye condition where the eyelids “flip” or roll inward. As a result, hairs rub on the clear surface of the eye (the cornea), which is very painful and can lead to wounds on the eye, severe scarring, and if left untreated, loss of vision. Eye issues in cats are considered urgent . If your cat has excessive tearing, squinting, discomfort, or eye irritation, seek veterinary care for your cat as soon as possible. Entropion is an abnormal inward rolling of the upper or lower eyelids, causing abnormal, painful friction with the surface of the eye. Entropion is especially irritating to the cornea, the clear outer covering of the eye. The abnormal rolling of the eyelid introduces hair directly onto the cornea and the conjunctiva (pink inner lining of the eye), causing scratches, ulcers, inflammation, discharge, and pain. Any cat can have entropion; however short-nosed breeds with bulging eyes, such as Himalayan and Persian cats, have an increased risk due to crowded facial features. Entropion signs vary depending on severity. Most commonly, cats display: Squinting Eye discharge Rubbing of the eye Nasal discharge Swollen eyelids Red eyes Eyelid spasms Raised third eyelid Conjunctivitis Cloudy cornea and ulceration There are three main causes of entropion in cats: Congenital means “present at birth,” and is usually noticed around two weeks of age, when the eyes open for the first time. This is an uncommon form of entropion in cats. Anatomical, or developmental, entropion occurs in brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds and purebred Himalayan or Persians. In these breeds, the eyes bulge due to a shallow eye socket, causing crowding in the face and subsequent inversion of the eyelid. There are three types of acquired, or secondary entropion in cats. Pain-related: Spastic entropion is the most common type of entropion in cats. This type develops secondary to chronic squinting from painful eye diseases, such as viral or bacterial eye infections, corneal ulcers , or dry eye , that cause involuntary ocular muscle spasms and subsequent inward rolling of the eyelid. The eye’s anatomy is initially normal, but chronic irritation, especially from feline herpesvirus-1 , causes damage that is sometimes permanent. Spastic entropion often involves only one eye, but can involve both. Injury-related: Cicatricial entropion is uncommon in cats and happens when the eyelid is damaged or scarred because of a previous injury. Age-related: Involutional entropion occurs most often in senior cats and involves the age-related loss of the fat pad behind the eye, causing the eye to “sink in” slightly and allowing the eyelids to abnormally roll. Click here to download this medical illustration. Diagnosing entropion in cats is typically straightforward when eyelid hairs are rubbing the surface of the eye. However, some cases can be more challenging. Many cats, especially those who are in pain , may close or squint their eyes. This leads to intermittent or difficult-to-see entropion. Veterinarians may use a variety of tests to identify entropion and secondary eye issues, including: Numbing drops (topical anesthetic) : If your cat has spastic entropion, numbing the surface of the eye often provides enough relief to allow the eyelid to relax and roll back to a normal position. Numbing eye drops are only used for diagnosis and cannot be used as an ongoing pain-relieving medication. The underlying condition must be identified to resolve the issue. Fluorescein stain test : Veterinarians may place a drop of sterile eye called a fluorescein stain test to screen for a scratch (ulcer) on the cornea. A corneal ulcer glows bright green under a blacklight with this test. Intraocular pressure test : The vet may also use an intraocular pressure test to look for inflammation or glaucoma, either as a reason for the entropion or as a secondary complication. Schirmer tear test : Veterinarians may perform a Schirmer tear test to quantify your cat’s normal tear production. Low tear production could be the reason for pain, inflammation, and irritation, leading to entropion. Treating entropion in cats depends on the cause for the condition. Treatment for entropion in cats generally involves eyelid surgery and medications. Treatment for entropion in cats is highly individual, depending on the underlying cause of the entropion and the severity of your cat’s eye condition. Your vet may prescribe one or more medications: Antibiotic eye drops or ointment (erythromycin or ofloxacin) Pain-relieving medication ( Onsior ) Antiviral medication ( cidofovir eye drops or famciclovir oral suspension) Cats with entropion often require surgical correction under general anesthesia and typically have an excellent success rate. Entropion correction surgery is a delicate procedure, requiring special equipment and the experience of a veterinary ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist removes a small elliptical wedge of eyelid skin for correction. By removing the ideal required amount of eyelid skin, tailored to each individual cat, this creates an eyelid that fits well into the eyeball and no longer rolls onto the eye. Occasionally, cats with entropion may benefit from a temporary procedure called tacking of the eyelids, which uses sutures to keep the eyelid from rolling onto the eye during the healing process. This procedure may allow a kitten to “outgrow” the entropion as the anatomy of their head matures. Entropion surgery may cost anywhere between $1,000 to $3,000. Cost may vary depending on the veterinarian’s location and experience level, and if the entropion involves one or both eyes. Some veterinary ophthalmologists may use hyaluronic acid (HA) injections as an alternative to surgery, especially in a senior cat who is a poor candidate for anesthesia. HA is a filler-type material that can “puff out” the eyelids, allowing the eyelid to be successfully turned outward. This is typically a safe and lower-cost method in mild cases of entropion. However, the success rate is less predictable than surgical correction and may require additional follow-ups and procedures. Cats generally recover well from entropion. Following surgery, recheck appointments are necessary, usually within 10–14 days after surgery. Extremely fine suture material is used, dissolving on its own, although sometimes sutures need to be removed. During the healing process, the incision area may be red and inflamed with minimal discharge. Cats need to wear a recovery cone or collar to prevent them from injuring the eye or incision. Cats may recover with topical eye medications, as well as oral medications to treat pain and inflammation and to prevent infection. Contact a veterinarian if your cat shows the following signs after surgery : Pus-like discharge from the incision or eye New or worsening redness or swelling around the incision and eye New or worsening squinting New or worsening cloudiness to the surface of the eye Decreased or no appetite Some cats will have permanent corneal scarring and conjunctivitis even after correction of the entropion, and they may require lifelong medications to maintain eye comfort and health. Optixcare (eye lube plus) is a great general eye-lubricating gel that helps soothe and keep the eye moist. Brachycephalic breeds may benefit from continued lubrication that may help decrease occurrences of entropion in the future. Because most cases of entropion are spastic, it is important to monitor your cat’s eyes closely and seek veterinary treatment quickly. Early intervention offers the best chance of success and can return the eye to normal function. Surgery costs can range from approximately $1,000 to $3,000. More involved cases are in the $5,000 range. Entropion in cats can be managed with medications, and surgery can result in a cure. Entropion in cats is a very painful and irritating condition. Yes. Entropion is an emergency for your cat, due to the pain and damage caused by the hairs and eyelashes rubbing on the cornea, resulting in corneal ulcers, wounds, and scarring. If your cat has excessive tearing or squinting, seek veterinary care as soon as possible.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_eosinophilic_granuloma_complex,Eosinophilic Granuloma Complex in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Eosinophilic granuloma complex in cats often is a confusing term for three distinct syndromes that cause inflammation of the skin: The three syndromes are grouped together as eosinophilic granuloma complex, primarily according to their clinical similarities, their frequent simultaneous development, and their positive response to the same treatment with steroids. Eosinophilic refers to eosinophils, a type of white-blood cell usually involved in allergic responses. Granuloma is a large inflammatory nodule or solid mass. And a complex is a group of signs or diseases that have an identifiable characteristic that makes them similar in some fashion. The genetics are unknown, although several reports of related affected individuals and a study of disease development in a colony of cats indicate that in at least some individuals, genetic susceptibility (perhaps resulting in an inheritable dysfunction of eosinophils) is a significant component of the disease. Specifically, eosinophilic granuloma complex is restricted to cats. While eosinophilic granulomas do occur in dogs and other species, they are not considered part of the eosinophilic granuloma complex. Breed does not appear to play a role in cats. Eosinophilic plaque is circumscribed, raised, round-to-oval lesions that frequently are ulcerated and usually appear on the abdomen or thighs. The lesions contain a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil and usually affect cats in the two to six year age range. Genetically initiated eosinophilic granuloma is generally seen in cats that are younger than two years of age. Allergic disorders usually develop after a cat has reached the age of two. In cats, females may be more likely to develop one or more of the syndromes of eosinophilic granuloma complex than are males. Lesions of more than one syndrome may occur simultaneously. Lesions of all three syndromes may develop spontaneously and suddenly. Eosinophilic plaques: Eosinophilic granulomas: Indolent ulcer: Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as an allergic reaction or flea infestation. Any information you have about your cat's genetic background may also be helpful in diagnosing this disorder. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis as part of the diagnostic process. The physical exam should include a dermatologic exam, during which skin biopsies for a histopathology study will be taken. Skin scrapings will also be examined microscopically and cultured for the presence of bacteria, mycobacteria and fungi. Impression smears of the lesions should also be taken. Most cats may be treated on an outpatient basis unless the condition is severe and is causing your cat severe discomfort. A food-elimination trial should be started for all cases in case it is a simple allergy. A diet which the cat has never been exposed to should be put in place using high protein meats, like lamb, pork, venison, or rabbit, exclusively for 8–10 weeks. After this time, reinstitute the previous diet and observe your cat for development of new lesions. An environmental allergy (atopy) may be identified by intradermal skin testing in some cases. Your veterinarian will inject small amounts of dilute allergens intradermally (between layers of skin). A positive reaction (allergy) is indicated by the development of a hive or wheal at the injection site. Your veterinarian will recommend and prescribe anti-inflammatory medications for immediate relief from the swelling and inflammation. Hyposensitization injections, which use minute amounts of the allergen to lessen sensitivity to the allergen in question, works for most cats and is preferable to long-term steroid administration. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you in order to determine your cat's response to the food-elimination trial, and to monitor your cat's bloodwork. The results from the bloodwork is especially important if your cat has been prescribed immunosuppressive medication - as this will lower your cat's immune responsiveness to viruses and infections. As much as possible, follow your veterinarian's recommendations regarding the dietary guidelines for your cat. The treatment plan will be adjusted at each follow-up appointment according to your cat's progress. If your veterinarian is able to determine an environmental cause of the allergy you will need to prevent your cat from being exposed to these allergens. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/eosinophilic-keratitis-cats-symptoms-causes-and-treatment,"Eosinophilic Keratitis in Cats: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","Koichi Yoshii/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Eosinophilic keratitis in cats typically only affects one eye, but in rare cases it can affect both. Any age or breed of cat can be affected, but it is most common in cats who are around 5 years old. This condition is not considered a medical emergency, but if left untreated, it can result in significant discomfort, corneal ulcers , and in rare cases, blindness. Eosinophilic keratitis in cats is a condition that results in inflammation within the cornea, the front part of a feline’s eye. Keratitis is inflammation of the cornea while conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva , the pink parts of the eye. Keratitis occurs when inflamed cells spread across the cornea and conjunctiva, but the cause is unknown. Cats may experience troubling symptoms such as squinting , eye discharge, and eye pain . If you notice an unusual appearance to your cat’s eyes or concerning symptoms, contact your veterinarian. Symptoms of eosinophilic keratitis in cats include: Reddened eyes Raised lumps on the cornea/conjunctiva Eye pain Squinting Pawing at eyes Watery or mucoid eye discharge Blood vessels across cornea The cause of eosinophilic keratitis in cats is not known, but it’s thought there may be a connection between this condition and feline herpesvirus . There may also be an immune-mediated or allergic component to the disease. Any breed, age, or gender is equally likely to be affected by this condition. To diagnose eosinophilic keratitis in cats, a veterinarian will start with a complete physical exam . The vet will pay close attention to the cat’s eyes and note anything unusual or any concerning symptoms. During this time, the pet parent should discuss when symptoms started, if their cat has any underlying medical conditions, and if there has been any trauma to the eyes recently. To rule out other causes of eye inflammation in cats, the veterinarian may perform the following tests first: Fluorescein stain —A drop of bright green fluorescein stain is applied to the eye. A blue light is used to detect scratches or ulcers within the cornea that glow green. Schirmer tear test —A small strip of paper is applied to the inside of the bottom eyelid to collect tears. If a certain number of tears is not present in a specific time frame, it may indicate underlying dry eye . Tonometry —A special device called a tonometer is used to measure eye pressure, which could indicate glaucoma if pressures are high. If your veterinarian notes concern with your cat’s cornea and conjunctiva, they will likely perform a cytology to confirm a diagnosis of eosinophilic keratitis. During this test, a drop of topical anesthetic is applied to the affected eye or eyes. A sample of cells from the cat’s cornea is collected, using a special type of brush or a dull scalpel blade. The sample is added to a glass slide, stained, and viewed under a microscope to identify signs of inflammation. Treatment for eosinophilic keratitis in cats consists of immunosuppressive medications to reduce pain and inflammation. These may include the following: Topical immunosuppressants, such as dexamethasone sodium phosphate 0.1% Oral immunosuppressants, such as megestrol acetate If a corneal ulcer is present, it must be healed prior to starting any topical steroids. A topical antibiotic, such as Terramycin , may be prescribed to help with healing and treat any secondary bacterial infections. If your cat has been diagnosed with feline herpesvirus, an antiviral medication such as famciclovir may be needed for treatment. Unfortunately, eosinophilic keratitis is typically not cured and must be managed long-term, especially if your cat has other underlying health issues. Eosinophilic keratitis in cats commonly recurs following treatment and typically requires long-term management to keep the eye inflammation under control. Ensuring you give your cat the medications as prescribed by your veterinarian will help control symptoms and keep him comfortable. Since the underlying cause of eosinophilic keratitis in cats is unknown, it’s difficult to prevent this condition. However, pet parents should ensure their cats receive regular veterinary care to identify any health concerns early, so that necessary treatment can be discussed. The exact cause is unknown, but it may be related to underlying immune-mediated or allergic diseases, or feline herpesvirus. Any autoimmune disease in cats can trigger keratitis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Keratitis is inflammation of the cornea (the front layer of the eye), while conjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva (the pink parts of the eye).

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/epilepsy-cats,Epilepsy in Cats,"Epilepsy is a neurologic medical condition that is defined by a cat having two or more unprovoked seizures. If your cat has only had one seizure, it is considered an isolated incident and they are not considered to have epilepsy. Seizures in cats come from an abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Idiopathic epilepsy is a hereditary disorder of the brain that occurs for an unknown reason. Idiopathic, or primary, epilepsy is the diagnosis made in cats when there is no structural cause for the seizures but there is abnormal electrical activity. Symptomatic epilepsy involves seizures where structural changes to the brain are seen on advanced imaging, such as an MRI. Idiopathic epilepsy is common in dogs and is rare in cats, but is certainly a possible diagnosis if your cat develops seizures. While still rare, cats are more likely to have structural changes, therefore most epilepsy in cats is classified as symptomatic. Depending on the underlying cause of epilepsy in cats, seizures can start at anytime in life, young or old. No matter if your cat has had one or many seizures, contact your veterinarian for guidance, as your cat will likely need an examination. Seizures in cats are caused by a sudden surge in electrical activity of the brain that causes symptoms such as tremors and convulsing. Epilepsy is the term used to describe a neurologic medical condition in which a cat has repeated seizures—two or more. Epilepsy can be characterized by having one seizure at a time or multiple clusters, and they can occur regularly or unexpectedly. It is often a symptom of a disease process within the brain, but in cats, seizures are often from an unknown cause. Epilepsy is associated with three stages when a cat is having a seizure. The symptoms of each stage can be very different. Pre-ictal phase —aura; characterized by a behavior change before seizure occurs: Hiding Attention-seeking Licking lips Head turning unusually Ictal phase —active seizure activity Generalized seizure also called gran mal seizure (similar to a human’s gran mal seizure) and often lasts one to two minutes. It affects the entire body and usually causes cats to be unaware of their surroundings or even lose consciousness: Partial or complete collapse Jerky movements Convulsing Stiff limbs with joints locked Paddling or running movements of the legs and arms Urination and/or defecation Excessive salivation or foaming at the mouth Disorientation Often, but not always, the head is tilted backward Status epilepticus in particular is a type of generalized seizure that lasts more than 5–10 minutes. This is a true medical emergency and requires emergency treatment Partial or focal seizure­ —Abnormal movement localized in one area of the body; cat is often fully awake and aware of its surroundings: Strange, uncharacteristic behavior Unusual vocalization Drooling Twitching Abnormal body posture Chewing movements Post-ictal —change in behavior after seizure occurs; period of time before cat acts “normal” again: Disorientation Pacing Lethargic Not wanting to eat Epilepsy is more common in cats younger than 8 years old , but it can happen at any age. Any disease that involves the brain directly or affects other body systems, such as the liver or kidneys, can cause seizures. Intracranial causes of seizures come from within the brain itself, while extracranial causes are outside of the brain. Seizures in cats can occur at any time, but they often occur when there are changes to brain activity such as falling asleep, waking up, excitement, feeding time, or another change in activity. Idiopathic or primary epilepsy Intracranial epilepsy Brain tumors Inflammation of the brain (meningitis) Head trauma such as traffic accidents, skull fractures, cat bites Brain parasites such as toxoplasmosis Brain infection such as encephalitis Brain anomalies such as hydrocephalus Extracranial epilepsy Inner or middle ear infections Toxin exposure (may cause epilepsy but often only causes one seizure) Exposure to flea and tick medications formulated for dogs Ingestion of human medications, ethylene glycol (antifreeze) , or rat poison FIP and FeLV Metabolic anomalies such as portosystemic shunt (PSS), low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), low blood sodium (hyponatremia), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), or thiamine deficiency Diabetes Liver or kidney disease High blood pressure A diagnosis of epilepsy is made when your cat has two or more seizure episodes. While the actual act of having a seizure can be diagnosed visibly, the underlying cause requires diagnostics testing. If you suspect your cat is having a seizure, one of the most helpful tools for your veterinarian is taking a video of the behavior. Full bloodwork and urine testing is needed to evaluate your cat’s blood sugar, along with bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. Specialized blood tests for infectious diseases such as FIV, FeLV and toxoplasmosis are often done as well. X-rays are taken to look at the structure of the skull and other internal organs, but the most common tests done on cats with a suspected epilepsy diagnosis are CT scans or MRIs. These imaging techniques are usually done with a veterinary internal medicine specialist or a veterinary neurologist. which your primary veterinarian can refer you to after epilepsy is diagnosed. While your cat is under anesthesia for a CT scan or MRI, your veterinarian will often take samples of spinal fluid for infectious disease testing and look for signs of inflammation. Intracranial causes of epilepsy do require a CT or MRI to be confirmed. The goal of the diagnostic testing is to find the underlying condition, so that a specific treatment plan can be made for your cat to help reduce or eliminate further seizures from occurring. Depending on the severity of your cat’s epilepsy, your veterinarian will determine how aggressively they will need to search for a definitive diagnosis. While a single seizure episode may be curable, epilepsy is often about managing the disease, unless the cause of the seizure is found and eliminated. Treating epilepsy can often be very complicated, involving multiple medications or only one, as each cat responds differently to treatment. Diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, and cancer must be treated to try to avoid additional seizures. Anti-convulsant medications are the foundation of epilepsy treatment in cats. Common anti-convulsant medications for cats include phenobarbital , potassium bromide, levetiracetam (Keppra) , and zonisamide . Most medications, especially if they work well to control the seizures, are lifelong. Cats with severe illness associated with their epilepsy will often have to be hospitalized on IV fluids and started on injectable anti-convulsant medications. Depending upon your cat’s diagnosis, a special diet may be required, although cats can typically remain on their normal diet. Cats with epilepsy and on anti-convulsant medications are monitored closely with consistent, routine blood testing to check for therapeutic blood levels. Some of the medications, especially phenobarbital, can have toxic effects on your cat at certain levels, so frequent monitoring of the blood levels is very important. Monitoring also lets your vet know if the levels are too low and your cat is having more frequent seizures, so the dose of the medication can be increased. It also indicates if an additional medication is needed to help control the seizures. Always give all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian. Even if you think a medication is not helping your cat, do not stop giving it without your veterinarian’s approval, as this can be just as dangerous as the seizures itself. Without medication, sudden withdrawal can lead to uncontrollable seizures. It is also very important to stick to the dosing schedule for seizure medications. In cats with epilepsy, the goal is to maintain a good quality of life. The seizures will not completely go away, but will hopefully be reduced in frequency and severity. Even if your cat still has occasional seizures, they can live a long, healthy life, depending on the underlying cause of the epilepsy.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/c_ct_ovarian_remnant_syndrome,Estrus Symptoms after Spaying in Cats,"PetMD Editorial An ovariohysterectomy is a surgical procedure in which the uterus and ovaries are removed from a female cat. Such a removal results in the cessation of subsequent estrus (heat) symptoms in the female. However, some female cats continue to exhibit the behavioral and/or physical signs pertaining to estrus even after such a surgery, and are found to have some ovarian tissue that had not been removed during surgery and was left behind. If such tissue remains functional and continues to secrete hormones, estrus behavior will continue. Such symptoms are typically seen within few days after surgery. You will need to give a thorough medical history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and of course, whether and when your cat had the ovariohysterectomy. The history will usually include behavioral changes and signs of estrus that have taken place even after a successful surgical removal of the ovaries and uterus. After taking a complete history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination. Standard laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. It is not unusual for the results of these tests to return within normal ranges. More specific tests for measuring your cat's hormones may show estrogen and progesterone levels that are higher than should be expected in a post-surgery cat. A cytological examination of samples taken from the vagina will also help in determining the status of estrus in your cat. In addition, ultrasound can be used to determine whether any ovarian tissue residues are present. However, in some cases abdominal surgery may be required to confirm the presence of ovarian tissue. If this is found to be the case, removal of these residual tissues can take place at that time. After reaching a confirmatory diagnosis, your veterinarian will consult with you about a second round of surgery to remove any left-over functioning ovarian tissue. Prognosis is very good after the removal of ovarian tissue residues has been performed. All abnormal symptoms should resolve soon after surgery. Patients undergoing an ovariohysterectomy or follow-up surgery to remove remaining tissue will need painkillers for a few days after surgery. Preventive antibiotics are also used for some patients to prevent infection. Give medications as prescribed and follow the guidelines for proper nutrition and medication. Do not give any additional medications or supplements to your cat without first consulting your veterinarian. Image: Nikolai Tsvetkov via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_ethanol_toxicosis,Ethanol Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Exposure to ethanol, either orally or through the skin, is a common source of toxicity in household pets. Depression of the central nervous system is typical of ethanol poisoning -- expressed as drowsiness, lack of coordination or loss of consciousness. Other effects may include damage to body cells, and symptoms such as incontinence, slowed heart rate, and even heart attack. Ethanol poisoning in cats can occur as a result of exposure to dyes, inks, disinfectants, mouthwashes, paints, perfumes, pharmaceuticals, gasoline, and certain beverages. Symptoms will vary depending on the amount of ethanol ingested, and whether your cat's stomach was full or empty. The main symptom is a depressed central nervous system, which may develop 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion on an empty stomach, and up to two hours when ingested on a full stomach. Other symptoms include urinating or defecating involuntarily. Higher doses of ethanol ingestion can bring about behavioral changes ranging from depression to excitement, decreased body temperature (hypothermia), slow reflexes, and flatulence if bread dough is the source of ethanol (see causes, below). Signs of advanced ethanol poisoning include depression, slowed breathing and heart rate, an increase in total body acid (metabolic acidosis), and heart attack. If left untreated, this can result in your cat's death. Symptoms of ethanol poisoning may also be similar to early stages of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) poisoning. Ethanol poisoning can occur from the ingestion of a variety of products. Fermented products such as bread dough and rotten apples, food that a cat can easily find while digging through the garbage, is one source of toxicity. Poisoning can also occur when beverages, commercial products, or medications containing alcohol are spilled and lapped up by an animal. A toxic reaction from exposure to alcohol-containing products through the skin is also possible. Your veterinarian will be able to conclusively diagnose ethanol poisoning via blood tests that measure blood-ethanol concentrations in your cat's bloodstream. A urine test for low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may also point to ethanol poisoning, as well as a pH test for measuring heightened levels of acid in the body. Depending on the severity of symptoms displayed, treatment for ethanol poisoning varies. Intravenous (IV) fluids should be provided for dehydration, and medication may be administered to alleviate central nervous system depression, as well as to inhibit the metabolism of alcohol. In more severe cases, if your cat is having respiratory problems, artificial ventilation to aid breathing, such as with an oxygen mask, may be necessary. If a heart attack has occurred, cardiac therapy should be attended to first. Symptoms should subside within eight to twelve hours if the initial treatment is successful. Your veterinarian will follow up the initial treatment with blood and urine pH measurements, and will check for evidence of abnormally high body acidity until the danger has passed. The only way to prevent ethanol poisoning is to make sure that your cat is not exposed to ethanol containing products such as paint, perfume, mouthwash, fermented foods, and other products containing ethanol. All ethanol containing products should be kept out of your cat's reach – preferably in locked cabinets or secure containers. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_renal_tubular_acidosis,Excess Acidity in the Blood of Cats,"PetMD Editorial Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a rare syndrome that causes the kidney to be unable to excrete acid through the urine, leading to extreme acidity of the cat's blood. Cats with RTA will also have abnormal levels of potassium in the blood. This condition occurs as a part of the metabolic process, by which food is transformed into energy. Although RTA is seen in both cats and dogs, it rarely occurs in cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library. Some common symptoms which may be observed include: There are two primary RTA types: type 1 RTA (or distal), involves reduced hydrogen ion secretion in the kidney, and type 2 RTA (or proximal), which is characterized by the inability to excrete acid into the urine. Abnormal metabolic processing of bicarbonates is referred to as metabolic acidosis, and is marked by abnormally high levels of acids in the blood, and abnormally low levels of acids in the urine. Type 2 proximal RTA occurs because of reduced bicarbonate reabsorption from the kidney. This activity causes an imbalance of acids in the blood. Some of the common underlying causes of RTA include infection of the kidney and ureter(s), and feline hepatic lipidosis, a type of liver disease. However, there are times when the RTA is idiopathic. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Your veterinarian will use the results of the blood work to rule out or confirm an underlying systemic disease. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The results from a blood gases analysis, along with the results of the electrolyte panel, should indicate a normal anion gap (sum of the cations minus the anions in the plasma) with metabolic acidosis, indicating that the alkaline urine is abnormal. This is a key diagnostic feature of type 1 RTA. Your cat will be hospitalized until it no longer shows metabolic acidosis or low potassium levels. There they will be given potassium citrate and sodium citrate (sometimes replaced with sodium bicarbonate) until the metabolic acidosis and low potassium levels normalize. Potassium gluconate may also be given to cats with low potassium levels. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor any underlying disease your cat may have, and to follow your pet's progress. Cats without an underlying disease have a good prognosis for recovery when the condition has been treated appropriately and effectively. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/systemic/c_ct_alkalosis_metabolic,Excess Alkali in the Blood in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Metabolic alkalosis in cats occurs when higher than normal bicarbonate (HCO3) levels are found in the blood. Bicarbonate serves to maintain the delicate balance of acid and alkali in the blood, also known as the pH balance, which is chiefly maintained by the lungs and kidneys. Diseases affecting the kidney and gastrointestinal tract functions are usually involved in the disruption of the acid and alkali balance in the blood. Though it must be pointed out that metabolic alkalosis is a secondary phenomenon and some other underlying disease is usually responsible for this problem. Metabolic alkalosis can occur in cats of any breed, age or gender. Symptoms are generally related to the underlying cause of the metabolic alkalosis. The general symptoms related to metabolic alkalosis include: After taking a complete history of your cat's health, including a time line of how and when the symptoms began, your veterinarian will perform a physical examination on your cat. The next step will be to perform laboratory testing to check the levels of acid and alkali in the different body fluids. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Blood gas analysis is also very useful in the diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis. The laboratory testing usually provides sufficient information for your veterinarian to be able to confirm a diagnosis. Metabolic alkalosis does not occur independently, but as a result of an underlying cause that is responsible for the increase of alkali in the blood. Therefore, treatment of the underlying cause is of primary importance in correcting and further preventing complications of the metabolic alkalosis. In cats of severe, life-threatening metabolic alkalosis, emergency treatment is usually required. Drugs which may aggravate already existing metabolic alkalosis will be stopped. If there is vomiting, this will need to be treated, as it is one of the major factors in the development of metabolic alkalosis. Laboratory testing may need to be repeated to ensure that a complete recovery has been achieved, or whether further treatment is still required. After returning from hospital, observe your cat closely for a few days. If vomiting should start again, or any other abnormality is observed, call your veterinarian immediately.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_hypopyon_lipid_flare,Excess Blood Cells in the Eye in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hypopyon is the accumulation of white blood cells in the front (anterior) chamber of the eye. An inflammatory breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier allows for entry of blood cells into this chamber; chemoattractants, chemical substances that influence the migration of cells, can act as a conveyor for this cellular movement. The cells often settle in place because of gravity, forming a fluid line in the lower front chamber of the eye. Lipid flare, on the other hand, resembles hypopyon, but the clouded appearance of the anterior chamber is caused by a high concentration of lipids (the fatty substance in the cells) in the aqueous humor (the thick watery substance between the eye's lens and cornea). It requires a breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and concurrent hyperlipidemia (an elevation of lipids in the blood stream) to occur. There is no age, gender or breed predilection. Hypopyon Lipid flare Hypopyon Any underlying condition which causes uveitis – inflammation of the middle layer of the eye – can result in hypopyon. Most commonly, hypopyon is associated with severe forms of uveitis, but hypopyon can also result from tumor cell accumulation in cases that involve ocular lymphoma (eye tumors). Lipid Flare Lipid flare often results from a condition of hyperlipidemia (raised or abnormal levels of lipids – the fatty substance of the bloodstream – in the blood stream), and concurrent breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier (due to uveitis). Hyperlipidemia may also destabilize the blood-aqueous barrier directly. High levels of lipids in the circulating blood following a meal (postprandial lipemia) may occasionally result in the appearance of lipemic aqueous if uveitis is present. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and ocular examination on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Hypopyon may be diagnosed by the presence of fibrin (the protein end product of coagulated blood) in the anterior chamber – generally forms an irregular clot, not a ventrally located horizontal line. Lipid flare will need to be differentiated from severe aqueous flare, which does not appear as milky/white as lipid flare. Animals that are affected with severe aqueous flare generally exhibit much more ocular pain than animals with lipid flare. Diffuse corneal edema, a severe corneal edema, may be confused with anterior chamber opacity, but corneal stromal (connective tissue) thickening, keratoconus (degenerative non-inflammatory disorder of the eye), and corneal bullae (fluid-filled blister) are more typically noted with diffuse corneal edema than with hypopyon or lipid flare. Hypopyon requires aggressive treatment for the uveitis and its underlying cause. Outpatient treatment is generally adequate, but you will need to be aware that there is still a significant chance that your cat will lose its sight. Lipid flare requires treatment for the uveitis, which is usually mild, and any underlying metabolic disorders. If your cat is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, you will need to change the cat's diet to one that is lower in fat and calories, in order to decrease the amount of fat in the bloodstream. Outpatient treatment, with anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed for home administration, is generally adequate. Your veterinarian will schedule a check-up for two to three days after the initial treatment. Intraocular (within the eyes) pressure should be monitored to detect secondary glaucoma. The frequency of subsequent rechecks will be dictated by the severity of the disease and your cat's individual response to treatment. The expected prognosis may depend heavily on what the underlying condition is behind the eye condition. For example, with hypopyon, the prognosis is guarded depending on the underlying disease and response to treatment. With lipid flare, the prognosis is usually good. It generally responds quickly (within 24–72 hours) to moderate anti-inflammatory therapy. However, keep in mind that recurrence and the need for further treatment is possible with lipid flare.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hypercapnia,Excess Carbon Dioxide in the Blood in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hypercapnia is synonymous with hypoventilation, or inadequate inhalation of fresh air. It is generally the result of alveolar hypoventilation, a failure of the air cells in the lungs to take in adequate amounts of clean oxygen. It may also be related to lung disease or to environmental conditions that result in increased levels of carbon dioxide in the breathable air. Hypercapnia is characterized by an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood. Carbon dioxide is a normal part of the atmosphere, and a normal component of the chemical make-up of the mammalian body. Carbon dioxide is the end product of aerobic cellular metabolism (the function of cells that require oxygen to operate). It is considered the primary drive to breath, by stimulation of central chemoreceptors in the medulla oblongata (the lower portion of the brainstem). It is carried in the blood in three forms: 65 percent is as a bicarbonate; 30 percent is bound to hemoglobin; and 5 percent is dissolved in plasma. As a natural part of the atmosphere and the air that is inhaled, carbon dioxide is constantly being added to and removed from the air cells in the lungs. The normal amount of carbon dixide in the arterial blood is 35-45 mm Hg (a measurable unit of pressure). However, an excess of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream can lead to an abnormal condition, causing symptoms ranging from dizziness to convulsions. Left untreated, a state of hypercapnia can lead to death. Any breed, age, or gender of cat can be affected by this disorder. Because the brain is primarily affected by this condition, nervous system signs abound. Other symptoms include: Hypoventilation that results from a decrease in alveolar ventilation; may be the result of one of the following: It may also occur spontaneously in patients during inhalation of anesthesia or due to increased inhaled carbon dioxide, such as what occurs from rebreathing gases that had been exhaled. The most common cause, however, is due to an exhausted carbon dioxide absorbent in the anesthesia machine is the most common cause. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. If your cat is conscious, your doctor will check your cat for symptoms of hyperthermia (body temperature that is too high), hypoxemia (lack of oxygen), and head trauma. If your cat is not conscious, especially if it is due to being anesthetized, your veterinarian will check your cat for hypoxemia. If none of these disorders are found to be the cause of the symptoms, your veterinarian will perform an upper airway endoscopy to rule out a laryngeal mass or paralysis of the larynx (muscles of the throat). The definitive treatment is to treat the primary cause, discontinue inhalation anesthesia, or provide adequate ventilation during anesthesia. Your veterinarian will begin by providing adequate ventilation into the air cells of the lungs. If your cat is anesthetized, your doctor will accomplish ventilation manually or mechanically with an anesthesia ventilator. Non-anesthetized cats with severe pulmonary or central nervous system disease can be treated by mechanical ventilation with a critical care ventilator, but the cat may require heavy sedation for this treatment. Supplemental oxygen will be determined by the primary disease, since providing supplemental oxygen without providing ventilation generally will not correct hypercapnia. Your doctor will assess the effectiveness of supportive (ventilation) and definitive treatment. This should result in a decrease in the respiratory effort. Arterial blood gas will be evaluated to determine improvement, and to assess the adequacy of your cat's ability to take in adequate amounts of free oxygen as needed. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hyperchloremia,Excess Chloride in the Blood in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hyperchloremia refers to abnormally high levels of chloride (an electrolyte) in the blood. Electrolytes play important roles within the dog's body: helping in heart and nervous system functions, fluid balance, delivery of oxygen, and much more. For every electrolyte a very delicate chemical balance is required, and each electrolyte has a specific normal range in the body. The electrolyte chloride, for example, is responsible in part for metabolism (turning food into energy), and keeping the body's acid base balanced. Chloride exists in body with sodium (Na) and their common source is sodium chloride (NaCl or table salt). Therefore, conditions responsible for altering the levels of sodium also affect chloride levels in the body. Elevated chloride levels are usually seen in cats suffering from kidney diseases, diabetes, or bouts of diarrhea. Hyperchloremia is seen in both cats and dogs. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Symptoms of sodium elevation may also exist along with those of hyperchloremia, including: Your veterinarian will want a complete medical history of the cat from you and will conduct a complete physical examination, with routine laboratory tests: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. Biochemistry profile results will show abnormally high levels of chloride, often coupled with high sodium levels, and in cases in which diabetes is also involved, blood sugar levels may be abnormal as well. Meanwhile, urinalysis will often reveal abnormalities related to kidney diseases. Laboratory tests will also demonstrate abnormalities related to any underlying disease like diabetes. The symptoms will be treated first in order to maintain your cat's immediate health. If the cat is dehydrated, fluids will be given to balance body fluids. Treatment involves treating the underlying disease as well as correcting the levels of both chloride and sodium in the blood. Your veterinarian will select intravenous fluid to balance the levels of both of these electrolytes. If the hyperchloremia has been caused by medications, they will be discontinued immediately. Because it is possible that the increase in chloride is being caused by an underlying physical disorder, treatment will vary depending on the final diagnosis. If your cat has been diagnosed with diabetes, it will be essential to resolve the problem related to it to prevent recurrence. Kidney disease, or a hormonal or endocrine disorder may require specialists, depending on the magnitude of the problem. If there is no underlying diseases associated with the abnormally high chloride levels, the cat should recover completely with initial treatment. However, if something is amiss, it is important to treat the underlying disease to facilitate a speedy recovery and prevent recurrence. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_iron_toxicity,Excess Iron in the Blood in Cats,"PetMD Editorial While iron is an essential nutrient for the regular functioning of a cat's body, it can become lethal when it is present in large quantities in the bloodstream. Cats may be ingesting unhealthy amounts of iron when they are being given multivitamins that are not appropriate for their age, size or health status, or when they are ingesting dietary supplements or pregnancy supplements that have been left within their reach but that are not intended for them. In the event that there is a high volume of iron present in the blood, damage can occur within the cells. Iron toxicity occurs in cats in four separate stages. Stage I (0–6 hours) Stage II (6–24 hours) Stage III (12–96 hours) Stage IV (2–6 weeks) The most common cause of iron toxicity is the ingestion of pills within the home environment. Contact an emergency hospital or your veterinrian if you believe your cat has ingested a toxic dose of iron. Your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. If there is an abnormally high level of iron in the bloodstream, this will show up on the results of the blood tests. If it is suspected that your cat ingested iron pills, diagnostic imaging may be used to help locate them and to determine whether they can be removed from your cat's digestive system before they can be fully absorbed into the body. Fluids will be given to the cat in high doses to help correct the shock and to correct the acidosis that is occurring in the cat's blood stream. If possible, the additional unabsorbed iron pills will be removed from your cat's stomach, either by using antiemetic drugs to induce vomiting, or by performing a gastric lavage. This latter method is done with a saline solution that is slowly pumped into the stomach cavity to wash the contents of the stomach out. The contents are removed in small amounts using another tube. It is important to monitor the cat's blood enzymes and liver enzymes following the treatment. Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up exam to test the cat's blood to make sure that the iron levels have been controlled. It is also important for you to observe your cat for any signs of gastrointestinal obstruction following the iron toxicity, as the digestive system may react to the toxicity or the medical procedures that were used to resolve the toxicity.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_small_intestine_bacterial_growth,Excessive Bacteria in the Small Intestine in Cats,"PetMD Editorial While it is common for small intestine to have bacteria, it can become a problem when the count is too high. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a disorder which causes an abnormal amount of bacteria to accumulate in the small intestine, which can then affect the normal intestinal functions, causing loose stools and weight loss. Often clearing up within a few days, but up to a few weeks; treatment options for this bacterial infection give an excellent prognosis. Common symptoms include loose stools, rapid weight loss, diarrhea, occasional vomiting and intestinal tract sounds (gurgling caused by gas). Inadequate levels of thyroid, low pancreatic production of enzymes, low levels of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and intestinal disease are some of the known causes for this bacterial overgrowth. Veterinarians will often perform blood work and bacterial cultures to determine the causes of the intestinal condition. In some cases a more invasive procedure, such as an endoscopy, will be required to view the intestine internally. Treatment is commonly given on an outpatient basis and improvement can occur quickly, typically within a few days and up to a few weeks. It is often recommended that the patient be placed on a highly-digestible diet to create less of an impact on the intestines during the healing. Antibiotics are also commonly prescribed to treat the bacterial growth. It is important to monitor your cat's weight and protein levels (albumin) over time and ensure progress is being made toward a full recovery. Diarrhea must also be observed because if prolonged, it can lead to severe dehydration. In addition, repeat treatments may be required. The prognosis of this disease is positive when it is not associated with other serious medical conditions, such as intestinal cancer. There are currently no known preventative methods for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_disseminated_intravascular_coagulation,Excessive Blood Clotting in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a bleeding problem in which clotting factors are activated with an absence of injury. Micro clots form within the blood vessels, and the clotted material goes on to consume platelets and proteins, using them up and leaving a lack of sufficient clotting factors and platelets. This condition can lead to a disruption in normal blood flow to the organs and excessive bleeding, both external and internal. Clotting factors, such as proteins in the blood plasma, are components of the bloodstream, coordinating with platelet cells to stop bleeding at the site of an injury by forming into a gel-like plug. Platelets are normal cell fragments that originate in the bone marrow and travel in the blood as it circulates through the body. Platelets act to plug tears in the blood vessels and stop bleeding. DIC occurs secondarily and in response an existing diseased condition. There is no breed, gender or age predisposition, though this condition is less common in cats than in dogs. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition, such as a possible run-in with an insect or venomous animal. Standard tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to look for underlying systemic disease that is causing this response. Some of the possible concurrent conditions that will be found are anemia – fragmented red blood cells (RBCs) will be indicative of this; and thrombocytopenia – a low platelet count. A blood clotting profile will be performed on your cat's blood to measure the time it takes to clot. Blood tests will show low levels of fibrinogen, increased D-dimers and decreased antithrombin-III (factors in the clotting process) if your cat is being affected by disseminated intravascular coagulation. When thrombocytopenia is found occurring along with a prolonged clotting time and spontaneous bleeding, DIC may be safely assumed to be the conclusive diagnosis. Your cat should be hospitalized in an intensive care unit and treated aggressively for the underlying disease. Your cat's activity will need to be restricted to avoid incidental bleeding, which can occur as the result of even small and seemingly minor injuries. Fluid therapy, oxygen and blood plasma transfusions should be administered to the cat. Your veterinarian may choose to use heparin to slow any further progression of clotting, but this drug will need to be used with extreme caution, as high doses can lead to fatal hemorrhaging. If your cat has been diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation, it must remain in the hospital until the bleeding has been brought under control and signs of improvement have progressed with reverse. Unfortunately, the underlying diseases that cause the body to react this way are generally very severe, and animals that are suffering from DIC, along with the causative condition, tend not to survive. Prompt and aggressive treatment is the only possible method for preventing a rapid and morbid progression. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hypercoagulability,Excessive Blood Clotting in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Blood platelets are minute, disc shaped cell fragments in the blood that are responsible for clotting the blood. Too many active platelets, or too few active platelets, can result in severe health disorders. One of these disorders, hypercoagulability (hyper-clotting), has several causes, but in essence it reflects a greater amount of procoagulants than anticoagulants in the blood. This means that the blood coagulates (clots) abnormally more than usual. One of the possible causes of hypercoagulability is when there are too many active platelets in the blood. The end result of hypercoagulability is an episode of thrombosis, where clots will get trapped in arteries, veins, or in the heart, causing a loss of blood to the areas these arteries feed. Hypercoagulability is usually secondary to an underlying disease. A blood clot that is blocking arteries in the lungs will present as severe breathing difficulties that come on suddenly. Rapid breathing, lack of energy, and possible fever are also be symptoms of an arterial blood clot. A blood clot blocking the aortic artery – the major artery from the heart to the body – will show as sudden weakness or paralysis, pain in the limbs, an absent or weak pulse in the arteries on the inside of the thigh, cold limbs, or blue-purple colored nails Hypercoagulability onset may be due to blood platelets that are stickier than normal, resulting in too much clotting of blood cells; deficiencies in antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant that prevents clotting in the arteries and veins; decreased removal of coagulation factors - that is, not enough procoagulants are being removed, resulting in an abundance of coagulating factors; or, defective fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the process where fibrin, the protein end product of blood coagulation, is dissolved, resulting in the removal of small blood clots from the bloodstream. Some of the other causes for this condition are: Since hypercoagulability is usually the result of an underlying disease, your veterinarian will order tests for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to measure how quickly your cat's blood is clotting, in addition to a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, and a comprehensive urinalysis. Chest x-rays will help to visualize abnormalities in the lungs, and an abdominal ultrasound may be used to further examine the body for an aortic artery blockage. An echocardiogram can also be used, for diagnosing blood clots in the heart, and for detecting high blood pressure in the lungs that may be present due to blood clots there. An examination using an injection of a radiopaque substance in order to view the blood vessels, called angiography, may also be necessary for confirming a blood clot. Another test, called nuclear perfusion scintigraphy, uses a radioactive tracer to illuminate the internal body, and is useful for noninvasively diagnosing blood clots in the lungs. If necessary, your veterinarian will hospitalize your cat for anticoagulant and fluid therapy. Your cat's activity will be severely restricted until the condition has reversed. Bed rest is essential when an animal has a blood clot blocking an artery, since physical activity can rush the clot into an essential supply organ or vein. For this reason, your cat will be placed on oxygen cage therapy if the blood clot is in the arteries or the lungs. If the underlying disease causing hypercoagulability cannot be resolved, subsequent clotting episodes will probably occur. If anticoagulant medicines are indicated, your veterinarian will decide how much, and how long to administer these medicines. The course of medication and therapy will be dependent on the amount of time it takes for your pet’s blood to clot after treatment. You will need to schedule check-ups with your veterinarian to monitor your cat's prothrombin times (clotting times) twice a week following discharge from care. After that, your doctor will probably begin scheduling your cat for weekly check-ups over several weeks, until it is certain that the condition has been resolved. Once this stage has been reached, your cat can be seen once about every two months or more. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_acromegaly,Excessive Growth Hormone (Somatotropin) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Acromegaly is a rare syndrome resulting from the excessive production of the growth hormone somatotropin by tumors in the anterior pituitary gland of adult cats. Clinical signs of this syndrome are a result of the hormone's direct catabolic (breaking down) and indirect anabolic (building up) effects. The anabolic effects, meanwhile, are mediated by somatomedin C (insulin-like growth factor I), which is secreted by the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation. The excessive levels of somatomedin C, however, promote protein synthesis and growth in a variety of tissues such as the bone cartilage, soft tissues, especially in the head and neck region. Eventually these abnormalities in joint cartilage growth and metabolism alter normal joint biomechanics, which can lead to degenerative joint disease. Somatotropin also fights the action of insulin, which eventually causes pancreatic cell exhaustion and permanent diabetes mellitus. Initially, signs relate to unregulated diabetes mellitus. As the disease progresses, signs of heart failure, kidney failure, or central nervous system abnormalities caused by tumor expansion develop, including: The hypersecretion of the growth hormone somatotropin by an anterior pituitary tumor. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. Other diagnostic exams include X-rays, echocardiogram, and CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans. CT and MRI scans are used to locate the pituitary mass. X-rays, meanwhile, often reveal an enlarged heart and sometimes fluid in the lungs, especially if left-sided congestive heart failure has already developed. And an echocardiogram will confirm heart abnormalities. A radioimmunoassay for plasma somatomedin C is available at Michigan State University -- which can confirm the elevated plasma levels associated with acromegaly -- but this is often impractical. Often, the goal is to treat and control the secondary diseases that develop following prolonged growth hormone hypersecretion (e.g., diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and kidney failure). However, there have been some successful attempts at treating the acromegaly. In one study, for example, cobalt radiotherapy was used in which six out of seven acromegalic cats showed permanent or temporary resolution of insulin resistance following therapy. In another case, the surgical removal of the pituary tumor by freezing (cryohypophysectomy) also showed success. The cat slowly regained normal plasma somatomedin C levels and the diabetes mellitus resolved after two months. Consult your veterinarian for the best course of treatment for your animal. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you to treat your pet's secondary complications, as necessary. Unfortunately, cats are usually euthanized or die because of complications associated with congestive heart failure, kidney failure, and/or progressive central nervous system signs (seizures, etc.). Reported survival times following diagnosis range from 4 to 42 months, with a median of 20 months. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hypermagnesemia,Excess Magnesium in the Blood in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Electrolytes are required in the body for many vital functions, like keeping fluid balance, normal heart and brain functions, delivery of oxygen, and many more. Magnesium, after potassium, is the second most abundant positively charged electrolyte found inside cells. Bones and muscles contain a major portion of magnesium in the body. Hypermagnesemia is the term used to denote abnormally high levels of magnesium in the body. Higher levels of magnesium can result in serious complications like impaired nerve impulses (signals), as well as cardiac problems. It is uncommon in cats, mostly seen in patients with underlying kidney diseases. High level of magnesium may result in life-threatening conditions, including those of the nervous system and the heart. Hypermagnesemia leads to the progressive loss of respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, and muscle functions -- all of which can be fatal in the dog. Other symptoms associated with this issue include: After recording a detailed history from you, the veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests include: a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests help determine the levels of magnesium in the blood, which will record more than normal in affected cats. Abnormally high levels of calcium are also found in affected cats. As hypermagnesemia mostly occurs in patients with kidney problems, urinalysis and other laboratory tests may reveal abnormalities related to an underlying disease. Additionally, your veterinarian will perform an electrocardiography (ECG), as characteristic ECG changes are seen in patients with hypermagnesemia. The major goal of treatment is to enhance the elimination of extra magnesium from the body. All medications containing magnesium will be discontinued to prevent further aggravation of symptoms. Fluid therapy will be started to enhance the excretion of magnesium from the body of your cat. Calcium is also added in your cat’s therapy to enhance the excretion of magnesium. During and/or after treatment, your veterinarian will conduct laboratory testing to see the levels of magnesium. An ECG will be conducted to see cardiac functions. Prognosis in cats with hypermagnesemia without kidney involvement is excellent after initial therapy. In cases of kidney disease, on the other hand, treating the underlying disease is essential for resolution of the problem on a permanent basis. Levels of magnesium will be monitored during and after the treatment. After discharge, if you see any untoward signs, immediately call your cat’s veterinarian. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hyperviscosity_syndrome,Excess Plasma Proteins in the Blood (Hyperviscosity) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Thickening of the blood, medically referred to as hyperviscosity, or high blood viscosity, typically results from markedly high concentration of blood plasma proteins, although it can also result (rarely) from an extremely high red blood cell count. It is most frequently seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome (the consequence of the presence of cancer in the body), and is often associated with multiple myeloma (a cancer of the plasma cell) and other lymphoid tumors or leukemias. The clinical signs that are associated with hyperviscosity are caused by reduced blood flow through smaller vessels, high plasma volume, and associated coagulopathy (a defect in the body's mechanism for blood clotting). There are no gender or breed predilections, and though it is generally rare in cats, when it does occur, it is more frequently found in older cats. Hyperviscosity is a syndrome, not a final diagnosis; however, your veterinarian will want to know what accounts for the symptoms. veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor will be specifically looking at total plasma protein count and evidence of blood disorders. Once a diagnosis has been confirmed, your veterinarian will work out a treatment plan. Generally, cats that present with this disease are treated on an inpatient basis. It will be the underlying disease that will be the focus of the treatment. The total treatment plan will be based upon whether the symptoms are being caused by cancer or by an inflammatory condition. Even after you take your cat home, your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat's serum or plasma proteins frequently to mark the effectiveness of the treatment. Follow-up blood tests will also be conducted, along with urinalyses from time to time, to determine how well your cat is dealing with the disease. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_proteinuria,Excess Protein in Cat Urine (Proteinuria in Cats),"Proteinuria occurs when there is too much protein in your cat’s urine. While some protein in feline urine is normal, high levels that don’t drop normally can be a sign of an underlying health issue. Like other mammals, a cat’s urine is first formed in the kidneys, where blood is filtered through a special filtration system. This filtration removes toxins and other byproducts of metabolism, including proteins. A structure in the kidneys called the glomerulus is part of this filtration system. One of its jobs is to prevent larger proteins, like albumin, from exiting the body in the urine. Proteinuria may be a sign that the kidneys are not functioning normally and allowing larger proteins to mix into the urine. Excessive protein in a cat’s urine—even on routine urine testing—warrants further investigation to identify what’s causing it. The earlier the cause of proteinuria is determined and treated, the more likely a positive outcome. There are usually no clinical signs of proteinuria in cats. It is often diagnosed during routine, annual health examinations, where bloodwork and urine samples are routinely tested. Symptoms are usually the result of the underlying cause of the proteinuria and not the proteinuria itself. If symptoms are present, they may include: Blood in the urine Straining to urinate Frequent, small urinations A strong odor to the urine In more severe cases caused by underlying chronic kidney disease and/or kidney failure, symptoms may include: Lethargy Decreased appetite or loss of appetite Vomiting Increased thirst Increased urination Lack of urine production Edema (swelling of the limbs) Ascites (fluid in the abdomen) If your vet finds high levels of protein in your cat’s urine, or levels that remain high for too long, they will likely order additional testing. Bleeding or inflammation in the urinary tract are the most common causes of protein in cat urine. Usually, this is caused by inflammation in the lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra). Less commonly, the prostate gland, uterus, or vagina may also contribute. Inflammation or bleeding in the lower urinary tract is most often due to: Urinary tract infection (UTI) Urinary tract stones (kidney, bladder, or urethral) Crystals in the urine Feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) Other less-frequent causes of protein in urine include: Urinary tract polyps High-protein cat diets Drug reactions Acute pancreatitis Diagnosis and treatment of these underlying conditions usually resolves the proteinuria. If the protein in your cat’s urine is not associated with inflammation or bleeding, then kidney disease or other systemic diseases may be the cause. Your vet will perform additional diagnostic tests to identify kidney disease. Other chronic and concerning causes of proteinuria include: Hypertension (elevated blood pressure) Hyperthyroidism Tick-borne disease Diabetes Parasites Toxins Cancers Viruses Any systemic immune-mediated or inflammatory condition Chronic renal disease/renal failure. Chronic causes of proteinuria require long-term or even lifelong treatment to lessen the protein in the urine. Vets usually first diagnose proteinuria through urinalysis. This test is conducted on a simple urine sample. During the exam, your vet will collect a urine sample with a dipstick and evaluate sediment. Urinalysis measures the amount of protein in the urine while also assessing for blood and any causes of inflammation, such as crystals, bacteria, and casts (tube-shaped particles made up of cells, protein, or fat). If more testing is needed, the standard method to obtain urine is called a cystocentesis. For this common procedure, your veterinarian inserts a needle directly into your cat’s bladder to obtain a urine sample. The process is often guided by ultrasound and produces the most sterile sample. This sample is then sent to the lab for a general urine profile or urinalysis. If urinalysis reveals blood or inflammation, your veterinarian will likely recommend further testing, including: Urine culture to look for infection Abdominal x-rays to look for bladder/urethral stones X-rays or ultrasound to look for reproductive or prostate disease After your cat receives appropriate treatment, your vet will repeat the urine testing to monitor for persistent proteinuria. If elevated protein appears in the urine sample without signs of inflammation or bleeding, then your vet will conduct further diagnostic testing to investigate kidney disease and other systemic causes. This may include full bloodwork to assess kidney function and protein levels as well as a urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) test. Often, your vet will take your cat’s blood pressure to rule out high blood pressure . If the cause remains unknown, your veterinarian may discuss more thorough tests, such as abdominal ultrasound, infectious disease testing, or viral testing. Kidney biopsy, which is used to diagnose glomerular disease, is widely considered a last resort. Kidney biopsy is an aggressive, invasive diagnostic test with the potential for significant complications. It is usually performed via abdominal surgery with ultrasound guidance or with a minimally invasive laparoscope. Once your vet figures out what is causing your cat’s proteinuria, they will prescribe the best course of treatment. Treatments vary depending on the cause. Urinary tract infections are often treated with antibiotics and have an excellent chance of recovery. Inflammation of the bladder without infection (feline idiopathic cystitis) is typically treated with anti-inflammatories and pain medications. Bladder crystals can be treated with diet changes and increased water intake. Bladder stones are usually dissolved via diet change or are surgically removed from the bladder via a procedure termed cystotomy. Polyps in the bladder often can be surgically removed via bladder surgery or cystoscopy. Treating and controlling diseases such as hypertension, hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, and diabetes may reduce lessen or even resolve proteinuria in cats. Kidney disease or kidney failure treatment depends on the severity of the disease. The goal of therapy in cats with kidney disease is to decrease the proteinuria by more than 90%, which may not be possible if the disease is severe. Treatment may include only a diet change to a low-protein, low-phosphorus diet in the early stages of kidney disease. As the disease progresses, fluid may be administered under the skin. You can be educated on how to perform this therapy at home. In more severe cases of renal failure, hospitalization with IV fluids may be recommended to correct dehydration, administer electrolytes, and flush/cleanse the kidneys to help lower kidney enzymes and support overall health. Most cats with proteinuria caused by acute inflammation or bleeding have an excellent chance of recovering. While they are at risk for recurring urinary issues in the future, they often recover completely with therapy. Cats with renal disease are often placed on a lifelong prescription diet with low protein and phosphorus. Sometimes, your vet may also prescribe probiotics or kidney supplements (especially omega-3 fatty acids). It is important to discuss any supplements with your veterinarian before giving them to your cat. Subcutaneous (under-the-skin) fluid administration at home can be helpful in maintaining hydration levels, providing electrolyte support, and flushing the kidneys. Your veterinarian can educate you on how to perform this therapy at home, including which types of fluids to use, how much to administer, and how frequently to do it. In cases of urinary tract neoplasia, or cancer, surgery and chemotherapy are often used to achieve remission and improve quality of life. Unfortunately, most types of cancers in the urinary tract are aggressive, and even with treatment, they are not usually cured. Chronic kidney disease is usually monitored closely with frequent visits to the vet for examination, weight checks, blood work, urinalysis, and urine protein creatinine ratio and blood pressure testing to help track any improvement and monitor the disease. When the disease progresses, oral medications can help support the kidneys, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors). Your vet may also prescribe immunosuppressive therapy or anticoagulants, depending on the cause and severity of the kidney disease. Proteinuria means there is too much protein in your cat’s urine. Persistent and excess protein levels in the urine are abnormal and usually have an underlying cause. Your veterinarian will investigate what is causing the proteinuria and determine the best treatment options for your cat.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hypernatremia,Excess Sodium in the Blood in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hypernatremia is the term used to denote abnormally high levels of sodium in blood. A vital electrolyte, sodium is involved in many critical bodily functions, including maintaining blood pressure, blood volume, maintain the delicate acid/base balance in the body, as well as play a role in the transmission of nerve impulses (signals) within nerves. A common source of sodium is table salt (NaCl). Due to the presence of chloride (Cl) in NaCl, chloride derangements are commonly seen along with sodium. If not treated quickly, hypernatremia can lead to severe consequences for the health of your cat. Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your cat, including a history of any previous medical treatment. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory tests include: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, which will reveal high levels of sodium along with other abnormalities. For cats with diabetes, urinalysis will reveal changes in urine, including low sodium levels. More specific testing for diagnosis of underlying diseases may need to be carried out. Fluid therapy is commonly used to correct the electrolyte balance. In dehydrated cats, fluid therapy needs to be carried out over some time to correct fluid and electrolyte derangements. Your veterinarian will measure the sodium and other electrolyte levels during and after the treatment to ensure that levels of electrolytes are within normal ranges. Treatment of underlying causes (e.g., diabetes) is essential for complete resolution of the problem and to prevent future episodes. Follow guidelines given by your cat’s veterinarian. Ensure continuous supply of water for those patients with diabetes. A sodium restricted diet may be suggested for your cat. Don’t give treats to your cat, especially those with sodium chloride, without discussing with your veterinarian. Stick with the diet recommended for your cat until complete recovery is achieved. Most cats with hypernatremia without any underlying disease respond well and prognosis is excellent. However, animals with an underlying disease responsible for electrolyte derangements, prognosis depends on treatment of the disease along with correction of electrolyte imbalances.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_congenital_eye_defects,Eye Defects (Congenital) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Congenital abnormalities of the eyeball or its surrounding tissue can be evident in a kitten shortly after birth, or may develop within the first six to eight weeks of life. Most defects are genetically inherited; for example, photoreceptor dysplasia, which is indicated by pupils inability to contract normally in response to light, is more prone in Abyssinian, Persian, and Domestic Shorthair cats. This affects the cat's ability to see in both low light and daylight. Ocular abnormalities can also develop spontaneously (e.g., colobomas of ther anterior) or occur in utero. Exposure to toxic compounds, lack of nutrients, and systemic infections and inflammations during pregnancy (such as panleukopenia) are other potential risk factors for ocular abnormalities. There are a variety of abnormalities that can affect a cat's eye or surrounding tissues. The following are some of the more common issues and their corresponding signs: In addition, hereditary defects, such as corneal opacities, cataracts, retinal detachement, and dysplasia, are often associated with the following factors: You will need to provide as much of your cat's medical history as you have available to you, such as in utero conditions (i.e., whether its mother was ill, her diet, etc.), and the cat's development and environment after birth. After taking a thorough history, your veterinarian will test the health of the eye. A Schirmer tear test may be used to see if your cat's eyes are producing an adequate amount of tears. If abnormally high pressure in the eye (glaucoma) is suspected, a diagnostic tool called a tonometer will be applied to your cat's eye to measure its internal pressure. Abnormalities within the eye, meanwhile, will be examined with an indirect ophthalmoscope and/or a slitlamp biomicroscope. An ultrasound of the eyes may also reveal problems with the lens of the eyeball, the vitreous humor (the clear fluid which fills the space between the lens and retina), the retina, or other problems that are taking place in the posterior (back) segment of the eye. In the case of iris cysts, ultrasound will help your doctor determine if the mass behind the iris is in fact a cyst or a tumor. Cysts do not always behave uniformly: some grow, while others shrink. In most cases follow-ups to check the progress of the cyst will be the extent of treatment, until further intervention is warranted. Another useful diagnostic method called angiography can also be used for viewing problems in the posterior of the eye, such as detachment of the retina and abnormal blood vessels in the eye. In this method, a substance that is visible on X-ray (radiopaque) is injected into the area that needs to be visualized, so that the full course of blood vessels can be examined for irregularities. Treatment will depend on the specific type of eye abnormality that is affecting your cat. Depending on your veterinarian's experience with eye diseases, you may need further treatment with a trained veterinary ophthalmologist. Surgery can repair some congenital birth defects, and medicines can be used to mitigate the effects of some types of defects. Congenital keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS), commonly known as dry eye, can often be medically treated with tear substitutes in combination with antibiotics. Other medicines called mydriatics may be used to increase vision when congenital cataracts are present in the center of your cat's eye lenses. In cases of photoreceptor dysplasia, there is no medical treatment that will delay or prevent its progress, but cats with this condition generally do not suffer from any other physical abnormality and can learn to manage their environment very well, as long as they are able to depend on their environment being stable and safe. Congenital KCS requires frequent checkups with a veterinarian to monitor tear production and the status of the external eye structures. Abnormalities such as congenital cataracts, PHTVL, and PHPV require checkups twice yearly to monitor progression. In addition, since most congenital ocular anomalies are hereditary, you should not breed a cat that has been diagnosed with any of these disorders. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/eye-infections-newborn-kittens,Eye Infections in Newborn Kittens,"If your kitten has an eye infection, your veterinarian may diagnose them with ophthalmia neonatorum, a general term meaning inflammation of the eye in a newborn. Though the eyelids of kittens are normally closed until they’re about 10–14 days old, bacteria and viruses can still make their way underneath and cause serious infections. Areas especially susceptible to infection include the cornea and conjunctiva. The conjunctiva is a moist, slippery lining that covers the eyeball and both the upper and lower eyelids. Cats also have a third eyelid in the inner corner of each eye, which is also lined with conjunctiva. On the eyeball, the conjunctiva is clear; on the inside of the three eyelids, it’s light pink. The cornea is the “window”—the clear outermost surface—of the eye. Because of its curved shape, the cornea, like a window, bends light as it enters the eye. The cornea is made up of three clear, specialized layers of cells. When infection occurs in newborn kittens, where the eyelids are still closed, thick pus forms underneath the eyelids and can cause serious, permanent damage to the surface of the cornea—scarring it, making it impermeable to light. Also, with an infection, the conjunctiva can stick to the cornea. Conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva is inflamed. Although puppies can have this condition as well, ophthalmia neonatorum in kittens typically involves feline herpesvirus (FHV) and/or Staphylococcus , Streptococcus , Chlamydia , or Mycoplasma bacteria as the underlying cause of infection. Because the conjunctiva and cornea are so susceptible to infections in newborn kittens, the eyes most commonly become infected as they pass through their mother’s birth canal and come in contact with fluid that is infected with bacteria. Similarly, feline herpesvirus is a contagious virus transmitted by direct contact of infected fluids. Droplets can be passed on to newborn kittens from an infected cat. Therefore, it’s important to keep all cats other than the newborn kittens’ mother away from them. Although all cats are susceptible to FHV, newborn kittens are fragile; their immature immune system increases their likelihood of infection. Crowded, unclean, and/or stressful living conditions contribute to infection as well. Ocular discharge can also be caused by a congenital abnormality that causes pain and damage to the cornea. Kittens can be infected underneath their closed eyelids or after their eyelids are open, but in general, eye infections are noticed when a kitten is between 7–14 days old. Signs of eye infections in newborn kittens whose eyes are still closed or who are less than 14 days old include: Sneezing or nasal discharge Swollen eyelid Clear or thick pus or discharge seeping out from under the eyelid Crust around the eyelid Sores on the eyelid Collapsed or deflated eye Signs in kittens whose eyes are open or who are 15 days old or older include: The eyelid remaining closed beyond 14 days old Sneezing or nasal discharge Swelling and redness in and around the eyes Clear or thick pus or discharge Crust on or around the eyelid Eyelid that seems stuck to the eye Collapsed or deflated eye Diagnosis is largely based on clinical signs of infection. The vet will do a thorough physical exam of the kitten as well as of the mother to evaluate her overall health. During this exam, your vet will use warm water to gently open the kitten’s eyes to do an ophthalmic (eye) exam. Once opened, the eyes will be carefully flushed and a fluorescein dye (a diagnostic contrast agent) will be applied to the cornea. This yellowish-green fluorescent stain is absorbed into and illuminates any layers of the cornea that are injured, making any injuries or ulcers visible. If your kitten’s eyes are still closed, having the veterinarian open the eyes prematurely does not hurt or damage them. Additionally, samples of eye discharge and discharge from the mother’s birth canal may be sent out to a lab for bacterial culture/susceptibility testing. With this, specific bacteria can be identified to help guide treatment options. Because serious and permanent damage—including dry eye, corneal scarring, blindness, and rupture of the eye itself—can occur in eyes that aren’t treated, it’s important to seek veterinary care for both kitten and the mother cat if you notice any signs. Specifically, in kittens with feline herpesvirus, the conjunctiva could adhere to the cornea and prevent the eye from moving properly. This results in impaired vision, loss of function, and damaged tear production. Because the discharge can permanently damage the cornea, your veterinarian will gently open the eyes to clean and flush out the discharge. Once clean, they’ll be able to evaluate the eye, and depending on their findings, they may prescribe a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic. If FHV is suspected, a topical antiviral may also be used. For home care, the veterinarian will show you how to massage the eye gently with a warm compress, focusing on moving the discharge toward the inner corner of the eye (medial canthus) to keep the eyes clean. Topical broad spectrum eye drops and topical antiviral eye drops may also be recommended at home. If a bacterial culture was done, treatment is based on which antibiotic is most effective for the identified bacteria strain. If a congenital eyelid abnormality is the underlying cause of the ocular discharge, surgery to correct the abnormality is determined depending on the severity. Because the infection is potentially contagious, it’s best to keep the kitten and the litter isolated from other cats in the household until all kitties are fully recovered and clear of infection. Typical treatment can last up to four weeks, and it’s critical to follow your veterinarian’s instructions during this time, paying close attention to maintaining a clean environment where your cat can comfortably recover.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_corneal_scleral_lacerations,Eye Injuries in Cats,"PetMD Editorial In medical terms, a penetrating injury is a wound, or a foreign object that enters the eye but does not completely pass through the cornea or sclera. A perforating injury, on the other hand, is a wound or foreign body that completely passes through the cornea or the sclera. Needless to say, the latter injury is a greater risk to vision. The cornea is the transparent outer layer at the front (anterior) of the eye. The sclera, the white of the eye, is composed of a tough covering that protects the eyeball. Again in medical terms, a simple injury involves only the cornea or sclera and may be penetrating or perforating. Other eye structures are not injured in a simple injury. A complicated injury perforates the eye and involves other eye structures in addition to the cornea or sclera. In fact, it can affect one or all parts of the eye. The entire middle layer of the eyeball that contains the blood vessels, and which is composed of the iris, the area between the iris, and the choroid - - the layer between the sclera and the retina - - can be injured by a complicated perforating injury. There may also be trauma to the lens, which can lead to cataracts or lacerations to the eyelid. Symptoms of an injury to the eyeball may be represented by the suddenness of the symptoms (e.g., pawing at the eye, blinking rapidly, swelling, inflammation), as well as the following symptoms, any of which may be indicative of an injury to the eye: Some of the most common occurrences that lead to an eye injury follow: If your veterinarian finds a foreign object in your cat's eye, appropriate treatment will be determined. The nature, force, and direction of the object's impact will help to identify which tissues may be involved. The visual response to a menace (i.e, blinking in response to an object being brought close to the eye), as well as aversion to bright light, will be assessed. The pupils will be examined for size, shape, symmetry, and light reflexes. If a foreign object is not found, your veterinarian will consider an ulcer of the cornea, or some other naturally occurring cause that is affecting the eye, before looking into the internal parts of the eye for trauma. The course of treatment will depend on the severity of the injury and the part of the eye that was injured. If the wound is non-perforating and has no wound edge or opening, an Elizabethan collar will be used to prevent your cat from scratching at its eye, along with antibiotic or atropine eye solutions. Non-perforating wounds that have a mild break in the tissue, or a pinpoint wound perforation, may be treated with a soft contact lens, an Elizabethan collar, and antibiotic or atropine solutions. Injuries requiring surgical exploration or repair: Most of the time, a cornea that has been lacerated due to injury, or has retained a foreign object, is salvageable. However, the further back, or deeper the injury, the poorer the prognosis for retention of vision. Cases that would warrant a poor prognoses, for example, would be an injury to the white, outer membrane of the eyeball, the sclera, or to the fluid part, the vascular layer of the eyeball. If there is no light perception, it may be due to a perforated injury involving the lens; a significant hemorrhage in the vitreous, the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball; or, from retinal detachment. Penetrating injuries usually have a better prognosis then perforating injuries, and blunt traumas carry a poorer prognosis than sharp traumas. Under most circumstances, your veterinarian will prescribe medications that are suitable to the seriousness of the wound. Antibiotics are usually prescribed, as well as anti-inflammatory medications and analgesics for pain. Deep or wide penetrating wounds that have not been sutured will need to be rechecked every 24 to 48 hours for the first several days. If the penetrating wound is superficial, rechecking every three to five days until it is healed is sufficient. As to prevention, take care when introducing new pets into the home if you already have a cat. Shows of authority by the established cat, or aggressive attempts at displacing the “head” cat by the newcomer can result in unintentional injuries. Also, as much as possible, discourage your pet from running through dense vegetation. If you are in an area that carries the risk of having debris transmitted to the eyes, like wooded areas, beaches, etc., it would be a good idea to have a bottle of saline eyewash to irrigate foreign debris from the eye.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_trichiasis_distichiasis_ectopic_cilia,Eyelash Disorders in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Trichiasis, distichiasis, and ectopic cilia are eyelash disorders that are rarely found in cats. Trichiasis is in-growth of the eyelashes; distichiasis is an eyelash that grows from an abnormal spot on the eyelid; and ectopic cilia are single or multiple hairs that grow through the inside of the eyelid. In all of these conditions, the eyelash hair can come into contact with and damage the cornea or conjunctiva of the eye. Trichiasis Distichiasis Ectopic cilia Your veterinarian will carefully inspect the eye structures and eyelashes to discern exactly which eyelash disorder your cat has. The diagnosis is usually straightforward in most cases. Your veterinarian will perform a Schirmer tear test to measure tear production and evaluate whether the affected eye is producing enough tears to keep it moist, and a fluorescein stain over the surface of the eye to make corneal ulcers visible. Determination of intraocular (within the eye) pressure is also an important test in evaluating the eye. This test will allow your veterinarian to evaluate the level of fluid pressure inside the eye. More specific testing may be performed to evaluate both the superficial and deep structures of eye. Eliminating the eye irritation will resolve symptoms in most cases. In case of trichiasis, in some patients the hair will be cut short to prevent eye irritation. In others patients surgery may be required for correction of the defect. In distichiasis no treatment is usually required. Hairs that have been mechanically plucked will regrow within four to five weeks, and will need to removed again. In some cases of distichiasis, surgery may be required. For example, in cases where the hair is a frequent irritation to the surface of the eye. In case of ectopic cilia, surgery is the preferred method for removing the ectopic eyelash hairs. Observe your cat's eyes and consult your veterinarian if you notice any recurrence of symptoms. Keep the eyes clean, either with fresh water, or with a veterinarian recommended eye wash. In cases of distichiasis, re-growth is common, in which case you may need to revisit your veterinarian for follow-up care. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_facial_nerve_paresis,Face Nerve Paralysis in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A dysfunction of the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is medically referred to as facial nerve paresis. It is evidenced by paralysis or weakness of the muscles of the ears, eyelids, lips, and nostrils. The cause of this disease is impairment of the facial nerve, or of the place where the nerves come together, and it affects the electrical impulses of the nerves involved. The facial nerve is affected, and sometimes the ophthalmic system as well, interfering with the function of the tear glands. Dry eye syndrome also accompanies the tear gland interference. Gender does not play a role, but long haired domestic cat breeds appear to be most likely to be affected. One sided facial nerve paresis: Two-sided facial nerve paresis: Central Nervous System You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will first determine whether the paresis is one sided or both sided, and will then look for other neurological signs. Unless your cat has had an ear disease, or other neurological deficits, the cause will be determined as unknown. Some of the causes that will be considered will be possible middle or inner ear disease; if your cat is lethargic and has a poor hair coat, a test for hypothyroidism will be done; if your cat is sleeping a lot and is displaying symptoms related to a brainstem disorder, a disease of the central nervous system will be considered. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis, although these are typically normal in the case of facial paralysis. Even so, there are some disorders that might account for the symptoms, such as an anemia, excessive production of cholesterol, or low blood sugar. X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to detect the location of the problem. There are also other tests that can be used to evaluate tear production, motor nerve conduction speed, and for the detection of brainstem disease. Treatment will most likely be on an outpatient basis, but your veterinarian may need to hospitalize your cat for the testing procedures. If fiber develops in the muscles, there is a natural tuck up that reduces asymmetry, and drooling usually stops within two to four weeks. But, you will need to be prepared for the possibility that the clinical signs may return, or even remain permanently, and that the other side of the face can also become affected. The cornea on the affected side may need long term lubrication, and extra care may be needed if your cat is a breed with natural bulging of the eye (e.g., Persian). You will also need to have your cat checked regularly for corneal ulcers. Most cats tolerate this nerve deficit well, but if the disorder is in the middle ear, surgery may be necessary. Your veterinarian will want to reevaluate your cat's condition soon after the initial treatment for evidence of superficial loss of tissue on the surface of the cornea. If there is a corneal ulcer your cat will need to be seen frequently for treatment. After that, your cat will need to be assessed monthly for reflexes of the eye and eyelids, lip and ear movements, and to evaluate the return of normal function. Eye care: the cornea on the affected side may need frequent lubrication or application of artificial tears. Most cats tolerate this nerve deficit well. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/fading-kitten-syndrome,Fading Kitten Syndrome: Signs and When to Get Help,"Adobe Stock/vika_hova Caring for newborn kittens can be a rewarding experience—but it also can be heartbreaking if they experience fading kitten syndrome. Here’s what to know about the condition and how you can help kittens survive. Fading kitten syndrome refers to a kitten’s failure to thrive during the period between birth and when they start to wean from their mother or a bottle . This period lasts about four to five weeks and corresponds to the time when a kitten is most vulnerable to sickness. Fading kitten syndrome is a medical emergency that requires immediate veterinary help . Some causes can be successfully treated but a kitten's condition can deteriorate rapidly, so quick action is needed. Kittens who fail to meet normal development milestones may be experiencing fading kitten syndrome. Some of these milestones include: The ability to turn over from their back by day three after birth The ability to support themselves on their feet by two weeks of age Other symptoms of fading kitten syndrome include: Constant noises that indicate distress (such as whining or crying), even after feeding Gradually worsening lethargy Lack of appetite Poor suckling reflex/not being able to nurse properly Weakness Inability to gain weight Labored breathing Vomiting Diarrhea Nasal or eye discharge Pale or blue gums Low body temperature Fading kitten syndrome can have many causes, including: Trouble during birthing Lack of maternal antibodies (immune cells received from mom that help protect kittens from disease) Bacterial or viral infections Parasites Malformations present at birth (such as heart defects, gastrointestinal defects, brain defects, lung defects, or cleft palate ) Low birth weight Trauma Maternal neglect Malnutrition Environmental factors (such as unsanitary conditions or inappropriate environmental temperature) Genetics can also play a role in fading kitten syndrome. If a mother cat has a blood type that differs from her kitten, her maternal antibodies may attack the kitten’s red blood cells, causing anemia that can lead to fading kitten syndrome. This condition is called neonatal isoerythrolysis. A veterinarian should examine the new mother and all of her kittens about two days after birth to start monitoring for fading kitten syndrome. The doctor will give all the cats a physical examination and check for any abnormalities that could lead to fading kitten syndrome. A healthy kitten's next veterinary exam usually won't be scheduled until they are 6 to 8 weeks old, which is why keeping track of your kittens' progress at home is so important. Daily weight checks are vital. Kittens should gain 10-15 grams per day after their first day of life and double their birthweight by the time they are 1–2 weeks of age. If you notice that any of your kittens are not gaining weight appropriately or have concerning clinical signs, get them to a veterinarian immediately. Your vet will start by asking about your kittens' environment at home and what symptoms you have noticed. They will perform a thorough physical examination, and unless the cause is obvious, recommend diagnostic testing to identify any underlying problems. Diagnostic testing can involve blood work, fecal and urine testing , and imaging ( X-rays and/or an ultrasound). Unfortunately, sometimes a diagnosis can’t be made before a kitten dies or is humanely euthanized due to poor prognosis or poor quality of life. If you have other cats or kittens at home, your veterinarian might recommend a necropsy (autopsy) to identify any health problems that could affect them too. Fading kitten syndrome may be treatable if an underlying cause can be identified in time. For example, some bacterial infections can be successfully treated with antibiotics if caught early. On the other hand, some congenital (present at birth) defects can’t be easily treated or managed. Fading kitten syndrome treatment often also involves supportive care, which can include: Fluids can be given to keep the kitten hydrated and help regulate other body functions, like correcting low blood pressure. Dextrose is a sugar solution given to support blood sugar levels. Because young kittens still have developing body systems, they often can’t regulate their own blood sugar or have low blood sugar from not eating. Adding this sugar solution to your kittens' fluids or giving it to them by mouth may help them survive. Antimicrobials such as antibiotics, parasite treatments, or antiviral medications are given to combat specific organisms. These medications can be given by mouth. If your kitten is not eating well, some can be given by injection. Nutritional support is provided to your kitten when they are not eating well on their own. Typically, a feeding tube is placed either through your kitten's nose or directly into the stomach to provide them with the calories, vitamins, and minerals they need to recover. Oxygen support is provided to kittens either by using a nasal device or by putting them in a special oxygen cage. Oxygen helps kittens that are having trouble breathing or have low red blood cell counts. Body temperature support ensures your tiny kitten can stay warm. Young kittens can’t regulate their body temperature effectively, which can result in a low body temperature ( hypothermia ). Heat support can be provided with an incubator or warmed bottles placed around the kitten. A delay in evaluation and treatment could result in: Low blood sugar Dehydration Low body temperature Lethargy Seizures Unfortunately, even with treatment, some kittens do not survive. Recovery from fading kitten syndrome is possible if an underlying cause can be identified and treated in time. Unfortunately, fading kitten syndrome can be fatal, with the highest rate of mortality in the first week of a cat’s life. If a kitten does survive this crucial period and grows stronger, long-term management involves proper nutrition, providing sanitary conditions and preventative health care, and close monitoring to ensure they gain weight. The long-term outlook for kittens who recover is good, unless there is an underlying health problem that affects the kitten’s life expectancy. Some cases of fading kitten syndrome can be prevented. Breeders should know their cats' blood types and avoid incompatible breeding matches. Mother cats should be healthy and fully vaccinated , be given flea and tick prevention medication, and undergo routine deworming . Make sure newborn kittens' home environment meets all their needs regarding temperature, cleanliness, nutrition ( feeding kitten milk replacer may be necessary ), and elimination. Take newborn kittens to the vet when they are about two days old to determine if they are healthy. If kittens are displaying any signs of illness, take them to the vet immediately. Kittens with fading kitten syndrome can die suddenly or within a few days. Kittens may also survive if the underlying cause is identified and treated quickly. It’s important to take newborn kittens to a veterinarian immediately if they show any signs of excessive crying, weakness, lethargy, or reluctance to nurse. The highest rate of mortality is in the first week of a kitten's life. A kitten should ideally nurse from their mom, but those with fading kitten syndrome may be too sick. In this case, kittens should be hospitalized and are often tube fed using a commercial milk replacer . Depending on the underlying cause of fading kitten syndrome, it may be contagious. Viruses, bacterial infections, and parasites are often highly contagious. If this is the cause of a kitten’s inability to thrive, it can be spread to other cats and kittens. The best way to tell if your newborn kitten is healthy is to have them examined by your veterinarian. It’s recommended that all new pets are examined by their veterinarian within two to three days of birth or adoption. Your vet will perform a physical exam and may test your kitten for infectious diseases and other problems with blood and fecal testing. If you notice your new kitten is showing symptoms of illness or behaving in a way that is abnormal, take them to the vet immediately. Yes, if the cause is identified and treatment quickly started, some kittens can survive fading kitten syndrome.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/fainting-cats,Fainting in Cats,"Fainting is known as syncope, a condition that causes physical impairment in addition to a loss of consciousness. Cats can sometimes temporarily pass out due a decrease in blood flow to the brain, caused by a lack of oxygen and nutrients. Depending on the cause, the cat can recover within seconds to minutes. Fainting is slightly more common in older cats than in younger ones. It may be seen more in certain breeds such as the Ragdoll, due to that breed’s predisposition for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy —a thickening of the left ventricle of the heart. Unlike in humans, fainting in cats is relatively uncommon because a cat’s head is a shorter distance above their heart when standing. A human’s head is a longer distance above the heart, which means the heart must work harder to pump blood to our brains. Any time a cat passes out—but especially the first time it happens—contact your veterinarian or animal hospital immediately. Often, when a cat faints it is due to something harmless like stress or excitement, but other times it can be related to an underlying condition, such as low blood sugar , heart dysfunction, or ingestion of a toxic substance. In these cases, prompt medical attention is required to ensure the issue does not become life-threatening. While fainting episodes can be distressing, it’s important to note the following (if you can) to provide to a veterinarian: What the cat was doing immediately before and after the fainting episode When the fainting episode occurred and how long it lasted If possible, make a video of the fainting episode, which may provide additional information On the way to the veterinary clinic, try to keep your cat calm and relaxed, as stress and excitement can trigger further fainting episodes. A covered carrier with dim lighting, along with Feliway® pheromone spray applied to the carrier , may encourage calmness. If your cat is prone to stress, anxiety, or fear aggression associated with veterinary visits, it may be beneficial to consult with your veterinarian about prescription medications to be given before transport. Falling to the ground suddenly, usually on their side Involuntary muscle twitching Loss of bladder or bowel control Limp, floppy body Pale tongue and/or gums Lack of response to voice or touch, signaling loss of consciousness One of the most common causes of fainting in cats (as well as in dogs) is heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure , heart valve disorders, congenital heart defects, or heart tumors that may interfere with the heart’s function. Heart disease may compromise the ability of the heart to deliver blood to the brain, causing fainting. Fainting can also occur due to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) from conditions such as: Liver disease Kidney disease Endocrine disorder Excess insulin given during diabetes management Insulinoma (an insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas) Severe infections leading to sepsis Kidney disease and diabetes, when uncontrolled, can also lead to electrolyte imbalances resulting in hypocalcemia (low calcium in the blood) or hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood). Both conditions can cause fainting. Diseases that lead to thickening of the blood, such as bone marrow disorders, or anything that causes low blood pressure in cats can also lead to fainting, including: Anemia Blood loss from wounds or trauma Hypothermia (low body temperature) Overdose of medications for high blood pressure, such as amlodipine, or diuretic medications such as furosemide Lung diseases such as pneumonia and pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) can compromise oxygen delivery to the brain and cause fainting. Degenerative myelopathy, a spinal cord disorder that interrupts signals to the brain, can result in fainting episodes. Ingestion of toxic substances such as lilies , chocolate , and onions can cause various kinds of internal organ failure that can lead to fainting. Less concerning causes of fainting in cats can include: Straining to urinate or defecate Pushing with the abdomen when coughing Swallowing too forcefully Pulling on a cat’s collar with any amount of pressure Any of these actions can compromise the pumping of a sufficient amount of blood to the brain, which increases the likelihood of fainting. Stress or excitement can also cause cats to pass out if the vagus nerve—the part of a cat’s nervous system that controls heart rate and blood pressure—overreacts to a stimulus or external trigger. If blood pressure or heart rate fall too much, blood flow to the brain will decrease, resulting in fainting. When a cat has fainted, the veterinarian will perform diagnostic tests to determine the underlying cause. They start by asking the pet parent for a detailed history relating to both the fainting incident(s) and any past medical issues. The veterinarian will then perform a thorough nose-to-tail physical examination, looking for: Elevated heart rate or heart murmurs that may signal heart problems Fluid in the lungs or lung crackles that may indicate pneumonia Changes in the pupils that may signal toxin ingestion or high blood pressure Changes in gum color that may indicate anemia Decreases in body temperature Signs of blood loss such as wounds or trauma that might explain any fainting episodes Following the physical exam, the veterinarian will decide which diagnostics tests may be most helpful for determining the cause of fainting. These usually include a CBC (complete blood count) and chemistry panel, which measures minerals and compounds in the blood. Based on the test results and the physical exam findings, the veterinarian may recommend further diagnostics, such as: An ECG (electrocardiogram) or heart monitor for cats suspected of having heart conditions Ultrasound, x-ray, or CT for cats suspected of having liver, lung, kidney, or brain issues or who may have tumors causing abnormal chemistry values CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) analysis may also be used to evaluate cats for diseases like degenerative myelopathy Determining the underlying causes of syncope in cats can help veterinarians begin the most effective treatment: For heart conditions, treatment may involve medications to regulate heart rhythm and blood pressure and manage heart failure. In some cases, cats may require surgery to implant a pacemaker to ensure proper heart function. If low blood sugar, low calcium, or low sodium is the cause, the veterinarian will administer fluids to correct the immediate issue and begin treatment to address the underlying cause, such as correcting insulin administration for diabetes, antibiotics and supportive care for sepsis, or a prescription kidney diet and phosphorus binders for kidney disease. If blood clots are the issue, the veterinarian may prescribe blood thinners or anti-clotting medications. Anemia and blood loss from wounds and trauma may require a blood transfusion. Wounds and trauma may also require surgery to repair torn skin and blood vessels. Fainting caused by medications may require the veterinarian to adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication without fainting as a side effect. For lung diseases, steroids and diuretics may be used to decrease inflammation, reduce coughing, and remove excess fluid from around the lungs. Ingestion of toxins may require decontamination procedures such as activated charcoal administration, fluids, or inducing vomiting. If fainting is related to stress, anxiety, or excitement, treatment will center around keeping the cat calm with a variety of management techniques such as Feliway pheromone diffusers, enrichment, gentle handling, anti-anxiety medications like gabapentin or fluoxetine , and supplements such as Purina Pro Plan Calming Care probiotic and Zylkene . If the cat is vomiting and straining to defecate due to constipation, stool softeners, a high-fiber diet, probiotics, anti-nausea medications (often Cerenia ), and increasing water intake can be helpful for managing fainting episodes. Fainting due to hypothermia may be eased by administering warmed IV fluids and using external warming tools such as hot water bottles. The timeline for recovery depends on the underlying cause of the fainting episode. For underlying issues such as heart conditions and diabetes, lifelong management is required. Episodes caused by stress and excitement may not require any at-home management if the cat rarely encounters stressful situations, or they may require lifelong administration of medications if the cat has underlying anxiety or aggression issues. After your trip to the veterinarian and a fainting and a treatment plan is in place, your cat may be able to go home the same day or may be hospitalized for treatment. At-home care in either case will depend upon the cause. The veterinarian will likely schedule at least one follow-up visit, so it is important to maintain your cat on any prescribed medications and follow discharge instructions from the veterinarian. Keep track of progress at home, any new episodes, and any medication side effects to report back to the veterinarian at the follow-up visits. Contact the veterinarian immediately if your cat faints again. If there has been any gastrointestinal upset, keeping your cat on a bland diet of plain boiled chicken and white rice may be helpful for the first two or three days. Activity restriction to decrease the risk of fainting again from overexertion may also be advised. One fainting episode does not always mean that a cat will be more susceptible to future fainting episodes; the diagnosis will affect the likelihood of it happening again. The prevention of fainting in cats depends upon many factors: strict adherence to treatment protocols, keeping the cat away from toxic substances, and working closely with your veterinarian to adjust medication dosage and timing are all important. Your veterinarian may also advise you to switch medications if adverse reactions develop, manage behavioral causes of fainting by reducing stress and excitement, and return for regular wellness examinations. Fainting related to heart disease generally carries a poor prognosis; in other cases, if the cause of fainting is identified and addressed quickly, the prognosis is often good. Borgeat, K.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/false-pregnancy-cats,False Pregnancy in Cats,"Although common in dogs , false pregnancy is an uncommon condition in cats. Only females who have not had their reproductive organs removed during a spay surgery (ovariohysterectomy) can experience false pregnancy, which occurs during a specific time in their reproductive cycle. To understand false pregnancy, one needs to know a bit about basic cat reproduction . Cats are seasonally polyestrous, which means they come into heat—the time when they are receptive to breeding—only during seasons with long daylight hours. They repeatedly cycle every two to three weeks during this time, unless a pregnancy or false pregnancy interrupts the process. In North America, cats breed in spring, summer, and fall. Cats are induced ovulators, which means they do not produce eggs automatically. A female cat’s ovaries release an egg only if she breeds with a male. If the egg is successfully fertilized, she becomes pregnant. If not, a cat can experience a false pregnancy (pseudopregnancy). Hormonal changes during false pregnancy can make a cat appear and behave as though she were pregnant, even though she isn’t. In most cases, a false pregnancy resolves without treatment. This condition is not an emergency, but you should speak with your veterinarian if you suspect your cat is experiencing either a pregnancy or a false pregnancy. Your vet will rule out a true pregnancy or other medical problem that could be causing your cat’s symptoms. Cats rarely show signs of a false pregnancy. However, breeding cats frequently experience false pregnancies, which are considered normal in the breeding process. Because most female pet cats in North America are spayed at a young age, a typical indoor cat is unlikely to experience a false pregnancy. Barn or community cats are the most likely to experience this condition. If you let your unspayed female cat go outdoors, she is at risk of becoming pregnant. When a false pregnancy occurs, a cat’s symptoms mimic those of a true pregnancy. False pregnancy symptoms in cats include: Weight gain Distended abdomen Licking the abdomen Mammary development Milk production Nesting behavior Cats can experience false pregnancy if they breed with a male and do not become pregnant. Changes in a female cat’s progesterone and prolactin levels—hormones associated with reproduction and pregnancy—play a role. Also, some female cats may spontaneously ovulate, which can cause a false pregnancy even if they have not been around a male cat. Only unspayed female cats can experience false pregnancy, but the condition can also theoretically occur a few days after spay surgery. This phenomenon is likely related to the sudden decrease in hormone levels after a veterinarian has removed a female cat’s reproductive organs. To diagnose a false pregnancy, your veterinarian will ask you to provide your cat’s thorough medical history and to describe your female cat’s lifestyle, recent behavior, and contact with male cats. Because pregnancy and false pregnancy may cause similar symptoms, your veterinarian will rule out a true pregnancy. Your vet may also want to exclude other reproductive conditions, such as a uterine infection ( pyometra ). To determine the cause of your cat’s pregnancy symptoms, your veterinary team may perform one or more of the following tests: Complete physical exam Basic blood work Blood hormone levels Abdominal ultrasound Abdominal X-rays False pregnancy in cats usually resolves without treatment. A vet won’t typically prescribe medications that alter hormone levels. This is because these drugs cause significant side effects, and false pregnancy isn’t usually harmful to the cat. False pregnancy does not affect a cat’s fertility. If your cat experiences a false pregnancy, they can become pregnant or develop additional false pregnancies in the future. If you don’t want your cat to have kittens, having them spayed will prevent pregnancies. Most false pregnancies last 40 to 50 days, until the cat begins a new estrus cycle. However, if your cat is showing signs of a false pregnancy, the signs will likely resolve within a few weeks. If your cat experiences a false pregnancy, you can support their recovery by keeping them indoors, providing comfortable bedding, monitoring their appetite, and discouraging them from licking their belly. A recovery collar or postsurgical onesie can help prevent licking. Avoid touching your cat’s mammary glands or letting her lick them, which can stimulate milk production. The best way to prevent your cat from having a false pregnancy is to have her spayed before her first heat cycle. Most veterinarians recommend that cats undergo a spay procedure at around 5 to 6 months of age, although spaying later in life still provides benefits. A spay surgery prevents pregnancy and false pregnancy and also reduces your female cat’s risk for various cancers . Only reproductively intact cats can develop a false pregnancy. If a female cat undergoes a spay procedure during a specific time in her reproductive cycle, she could develop a false pregnancy a few days later. After a spay procedure, false pregnancy is no longer possible. Cats may seem to be pregnant during a false pregnancy, but other conditions can also lead to symptoms such as weight gain, abdominal distention, or mammary gland enlargement. Obesity , tumors, infections, and organ failure are potential causes. Speak with your vet if you notice any changes in your cat’s appearance. A false pregnancy elevates a cat’s prolactin level, which stimulates milk production. Your cat’s mammary glands may leak milky or watery secretions for several weeks, but symptoms usually resolve on their own. To avoid further stimulating the production of milk, do not “milk” your cat or allow her to lick her mammary area.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_panniculitis,Fatty Layer or Nodule Under the Skin in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Panniculitis is a condition where the layer of fat just under the cat's skin (subcutaneous fat tissue) becomes inflamed. Though uncommon, the fatty tissue typically concentrates and affects the trunk area as a single nodule or as multiple nodules. In addition, as a result of secondary infections and other complications, the fat cells within the nodule(s) may die. Cats of any age, sex, or breed may be affected by panniculitis. Most cats have a single nodular lesion on the trunk that vary from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The nodule, which is either firm or soft, is freely movable underneath the skin until fully grown. In some cases, yellow-brown to bloody discharge is excreted from the nodule, while the outer skin may turn red, brown, or yellow in color. The area may be extremely sensitive, especially immediately after rupturing. After the ulcers heal, a scar or crusty layer of skin may form. Panniculitis may be caused by several factors, including: You will need to give the veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile. However, other than the presence of a mass or nodule beneath the skin, most cats will not demonstrate other complications. Depending on the underlying cause, other diagnostic procedures may be used to rule our other diseases/conditions. For example, the number of white blood cells on a CBC (complete blood count) typically rises in case of infection and help veterinarian determine the type, duration, and severity of infection. Your veterinarian will also usually take a sample directly from the nodule and send it to a pathologist for culture and sensitivity, which helps in determining the type of causative organism (bacteria, fungi) and the suitable course of treatment. Often, the preferred method of treatment is surgery, especially if only a single nodule is present. However, in case of multiple nodules, a combination of surgery and medication works well. For example, if fungal or bacterial infections are involved, antifungal and antibacterial medications will be administered, respectively. If no organism has found to be the cause of the panniculitis -- also called a sterile nodule -- your veterinarian will prescribe steroids, to aid in the regression of the nodule. Vitamin E can also be given in mild cases. Overall prognosis for cats with panniculitis is often good after treatment. In some cases, it takes just three to six weeks for the nodule(s) to completely regress. Your veterinarian will ask that you bring in the cat for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will conduct routine laboratory tests to monitor the progress of the treatment. This is especially true if steroids are being used to regress the nodule(s). Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_steatitis,Fatty Tissue Inflammation in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Steatitis is a rare disease in cats, characterized by a lump under the skin surface due to inflammation of the fatty tissue. Nutrition is often involved in the pathology of this condition. Ingestion of large amounts of unsaturated fats without sufficient antioxidant activity may result in peroxidation (where free radicals ""steal"" electrons from the lipids in cell membranes, resulting in cell damage) with subsequent fat necrosis (death of fat cells) and steatitis. Cats that are fed large amounts of tuna, particularly red tuna, tend to be more prone to steatitis. Steatitis in cats can also occur secondary to infection, inflammatory disorders, vasculopathy (disease of the blood vessels), cancer, injury, and immune-mediated disease. Some cases are idiopathic (cause is unknown). This disorder has become less prevalent in cats as more cats are fed commercially prepared diets that have added antioxidants. Steatitis can be found in any part of the body. It may be mistaken for a tumor, making it important to have the lump examined and biopsied as soon as possible. Steatitis is more likely to be found in young to middle-aged cats, from four months to seven years. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to what underlying conditions are causing the outward symptoms. To determine the exact cause of your cat's symptoms, your veterinarian will start with a physical examination of the affected area. A full physical workup will include a blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. To determine the full makeup of the inflamed mass of tissue, your veterinarian will also need to do a fine-needle aspiration, taking a sample of the tissue and fluid in order to conduct a cell examination and a fungal/bacterial culture. This is a painful condition, so attention will be given to your cat's comfort level and steps will be taken to encourage the appetite. Concurrent disorders will also be treated. Dietary changes are typically recommended. Your cat may require tube feeding for a while until its condition has sufficiently improved. Your doctor may also prescribe Vitamin E and possibly corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Temporarily removing all fish products from the diet and focusing on a nutritionally complete, balanced, commercially-prepared food diet is one of the first steps. Surgical treatment may involve draining the lump, or full removal of the lump. Antibiotics will be prescribed if the lump is found to be infected, or to prevent infection after treatment. To avoid further complications that can result from licking and biting at a healing wound, your veterinarian may advise you to keep an Elizabethan collar on your cat until the wound has fully healed. Feed a commercial diet that is balanced to meet all of your cat's dietary needs. It may require weeks to months for resolution of this condition, but the prognosis is good once the primary cause of the steatitis has been treated and an appropriate diet is established.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/fecal-incontinence-cats,Fecal Incontinence in Cats,"Our cat family members learn to use the litter box at an early age . It’s intuitive. Usually, they prefer to dig and bury their business, which suits indoor life well, yet it can be frustrating for pet parents when bowel movements are found outside the litter box. Fecal incontinence is a condition that occurs when a cat is no longer able to control when they defecate. Fecal incontinence is a loss of bowel control. With any normal stool there are three phases: the storage phase, the awareness of the need to defecate, and then the defecation phase. Most problems with fecal continence occur either because there is an issue with the rectum preventing stool from being stored normally, or with the anal sphincter itself, allowing feces to leak out. Fecal incontinence is uncommon in both dogs and cats, but it occurs more frequently in senior pets as they age and lose control of their bodily functions; they may not be aware of the need to defecate or do not have the sphincter tone (sphincter able to stay tightly closed) needed to prevent stools from dropping. Bowel movements outside the litter box Stool dropping without awareness Soft stool or diarrhea Stool staining around the rectum Stool leakage Redness or inflammation of the anus Frequent licking of the anus Changes in how the tail is carried Weakness in the hind end Standing near the litter box to defecate, but they couldn’t “make it in time” Fecal incontinence can be caused by a variety of conditions. Diarrhea can lead to incontinence, as the bowel movements come on so fast that a cat is unable to make it to the litter box in time. This is commonly seen in cats with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) . Certain cancers, like gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma , can look like IBD and also lead to diarrhea and loss of bowel control. Wounds, trauma, or tumors that affect the anal sphincter can also lead to a loss of bowel control. This is seen occasionally in cats with a ruptured anal gland, laceration, or abscess (a tear or open wound) near their anus. Sometimes it is observed following perianal surgery, like a perineal hernia repair or anal sac removal. Cancer of the rectum and surrounding region can also lead to sphincter or nerves involved in normal defecation. Prolonged constipation or straining to defecate can also lead to fecal incontinence, as nerve damage can occur. Cats that are chronically constipated or those that develop megacolon (an abnormal expansion of the colon) can struggle to control their bowel movements. Intervertebral disc disease a nd lumbosacral stenosis are both conditions that lead to compression of the spinal cord. While they are more common causes of fecal incontinence in dogs, cats can also experience loss of control of their bowel movements because of spinal cord damage and disruption of the nerves needed for bowel control. Some cats are born without a fully developed spinal cord and with poor control of their bowel movements. This is more common in tailless Manx cats due to a recessive gene that can lead to poor development of the nerves that control bowel movements. A loss of bowel control can also occur with age, as the anal sphincter muscles become thinner and it can be difficult for a cat to keep stool from falling out. Some senior cats also develop cognitive dysfunction, or dementia . This can affect their awareness of the need to defecate or make them forget where the litter box is in their home. A diagnosis of fecal incontinence starts with a thorough history of your cat’s health. Your veterinarian will want to know how often your cat is having bowel movements outside the litter box, if the bowel movements are solid, soft, or diarrhea, and if you have witnessed any stool falling out of the rectum without your cat noticing. Try to bring a fresh stool sample to your cat’s appointment. Next, a complete physical exam will be done. Your vet will examine your cat’s anus closely to look for any abnormalities of the sphincter and surrounding area. They will likely do a rectal exam, palpate (examine by feeling) your cat’s abdomen, and perform a neurological exam to ensure all the nerves that travel to their back end are functioning properly. A fecal exam of your cat’s stool, X-rays, and blood work may be recommended depending upon what is found on the physical exam. If IBD or GI lymphoma are suspected, they may recommend additional special blood work, an abdominal ultrasound, or intestinal biopsies. If spinal disease is suspected, a CT scan or MRI may be recommended. Treatment depends upon the underlying cause of the loss of bowel control. Your veterinarian will guide you on treatment options available after an underlying cause is identified. If your cat is diagnosed with IBD, GI lymphoma, or another condition that is affecting their ability to store feces, they will likely be put on long-term oral medications. If another cause of diarrhea is identified, it will be treated accordingly. But if chronic constipation is leading to fecal incontinence, your cat may be put on stool softeners and prescribed medications, and placed on a special long-term diet such as Royal Canin® Gastrointestinal Fiber Response Food or Hill®’s Prescription Diet Gastrointestinal Biome . Spinal cord and nerve issues may respond to medical management or surgery, but the condition might be so advanced that no treatment is possible. Some conditions, like tumors, may lead to surgery recommendations, while post-operative incontinence complications may resolve with time or be untreatable. Fecal incontinence related to age and sphincter issues is rarely something that can be treated—only managed. But some cats can benefit from a low-fiber diet to decrease the frequency of their bowel movements. While some underlying causes of fecal incontinence can be cured, others can only be managed. Some cannot be treated at all. If your cat is experiencing a loss of control of their bowel movements, it may be helpful for you to keep them confined to a smaller region of the home that is easy to clean. House soiling can be frustrating for pet parents, but minimizing the cleanup to a smaller space can help. Be sure to keep your cat’s bedding clean and dry. It is also important that you keep your cat clean. With stool dropping or diarrhea, there may be some feces left behind on the surrounding skin and fur. Be sure to keep your cat’s hind end clean so that they don’t develop secondary infections. Daily grooming wipes are helpful for quick cleanups on a cat. Some pet parents find cat diapers helpful, but sanitary concerns and routine bathing and drying of the backside are very important to avoid secondary urinary tract infections and skin infections. Keeping your cat’s back end shaved regularly may also be helpful for easier cleaning. In some cases, bowel incontinence can resolve if the underlying cause can be treated or managed. In other cases, it may not be curable. Cats can lose control of their bowel movements for a variety of reasons. There is either an issue with storage of feces or with the sphincter itself. Sometimes these problems are related to underlying inflammatory medical conditions, wounds or trauma, cancer, or age-related degeneration. Featured Image: iStock.com/krblokhin Cave, N.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/feline-audiogenic-reflex-seizures-fars,Feline Audiogenic Reflex Seizures (FARS),"Feline audiogenic reflex seizures (FARS) are a medical condition where loud sounds can trigger seizures in cats. FARS is more common in senior cats, with the average patient being 15 years old when diagnosed. It is also a genetic disorder in the Birman cat breed. There are three types of FARS seizures: Myoclonic Seizure: This is the most common type and is considered one of the hallmark clinical signs. Myoclonic seizures look like muscle spasms or jerking, and usually last only a few seconds. Cats experiencing this type of seizure look like they are conscious, but they have muscle twitches across their body. Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure (GTCS): This is what most people think of when they hear the word “seizure.” When a cat has GTCS, they fall over on their side, paddle their feet, shake, chomp their jaw, possibly lose control of their bladder or bowels, and are not mentally aware. Usually, these episodes last a couple of minutes. Cats are confused and disoriented for a few minutes afterward. Absence Seizure: Commonly called a petit mal seizure, an absence seizure is a subtle seizure where the patient seems to be briefly unaware. This type of seizure is more commonly described in humans because it is more obvious. A person may be sitting and talking to you one minute, and the next minute they are not responsive to questions. In pets, an absence seizure can be difficult to recognize, but it looks like the animal has lost awareness for a short period of time. FARS is not commonly diagnosed in cats. It is believed to have a genetic link and may be triggered by hearing loss. As a senior cat loses their hearing, first they lose the ability to hear lower tones. High- pitched and loud sounds are the last to go. Cats with FARS are startled by these loud sounds, and that can trigger a seizure. When a cat is diagnosed with a seizure disorder, it may not be possible to eliminate their seizures altogether. Managing seizures by reducing their frequency and severity might be the only option. A seizure is considered a medical emergency when it lasts more than five minutes, or if your cat has a cluster of seizures (more than three seizures in 24 hours). If your cat is having a protracted (prolonged) seizure or is clustering, they need to be taken to an emergency veterinarian as soon as possible. The following are general signs of various types of seizures, but they are considered clinical signs of FARS after exposure to a high-frequency sound: Muscle twitches, spasms, or jerks Loss of awareness Stiffening up and falling over Leg paddling or kicking while on side Jaw chomping/chewing Hypersalivation Loss of control of bladder or bowels FARS seizures are triggered by interrupted, high-frequency sounds. Researchers who characterized this syndrome linked the following sounds to onset of seizures: Crinkling tin foil, plastic, or paper bags Dropping metal spoon into ceramic bowl Chinking or tapping of glass Tapping on computer keyboard Clicking on computer mouse Computer printers Clinking of keys or coins Hammering nails Clacking together of wooden blocks Splitting firewood Clicking tongue Texting ding Mobile phone ring Alarms Clicking of gas burner while igniting Running water Dog scratching Jingling metal dog tags Walking on wooden floors with bare feet or squeaky shoes Children’s screams or peals of laughter The most common sounds to cause seizures are tin foil crinkling, dropping a metal spoon into a ceramic bowl, and tapping or chinking of glass. Researchers have found that more than half of cats that have FARS are either deaf or have some hearing loss. When hearing loss occurs, low-toned sounds are lost before high-pitched ones. The high-pitched sounds break through the quiet in the hearing-impaired cat and startle them. This causes a reflex seizure. Reflex seizures are triggered by specific environmental stimuli, in this case, a startling noise. To determine if your cat has FARS, your veterinarian will ask you about your cat’s history of possible seizures. They will want to know exactly what behaviors your cat displayed when they had the episode, and might ask these questions: Did they fall over on their side, paddle their legs, and chomp their jaws? Did they have muscle twitches? Did they lose control of their bladder? How long did the episode last? Did you notice anything different right before the episode started? If your pet is having seizure episodes, it is recommended that you start keeping a journal and include as much information as possible about the seizures. If you notice any patterns or specific stimuli that seem to trigger your cat, share those with your veterinarian so they can determine if it is FARS or spontaneous seizures. After a thorough history, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam. They may run bloodwork or do an x-ray or CT scan to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It is helpful if you can provide your veterinarian with a video of your cat when they are having an episode. This will help them diagnose the type of seizure your cat is experiencing. Your veterinarian may recommend that you see a veterinary neurologist for advanced diagnostics. FARS disorder is treated with prescription medication to reduce the severity and likelihood of seizures. Levetiracetam (Keppra) is a drug that demonstrates good control of both the myoclonic and the generalized tonic-clonic types of seizures. Avoiding or minimizing the seizure-triggering noises can also be helpful in reducing the frequency of episodes. FARS is not curable, but cats may find some relief from frequency of seizure episodes with medical management. All treatment is geared toward management and keeping your cat comfortable and having less seizures. FARS is a condition that affects senior cats and is a genetic disorder in the Birman cat breed. Because most cats diagnosed with FARS are senior cats, they may also have concurrent diseases that come with age. Prognosis is good for seizure control itself, but most cats diagnosed with FARS typically have additional underlying diseases or are seniors, and therefore they may not live much longer for reasons unrelated to the FARS diagnosis.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/feline-distemper-in-cats,Feline Distemper in Cats,"Photography by Adri/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Feline panleukopenia virus, also known as feline distemper, is a highly contagious, life-threatening infectious disease in cats. Feline panleukopenia virus is closely related to canine parvovirus . Feline distemper mostly affects kittens and unvaccinated cats. The virus enters a cat’s body through the nose or mouth. A cat’s immune system determines the number of viral particles that enter the body. Usually, the virus invades the bone marrow and intestines within two to seven days of a cat encountering the virus. It infects and kills the rapidly growing and dividing cells in the body. The virus suppresses the production of all white blood cells in the bone marrow. These cells are important to the immune system and are used to fight infection. Without them, cats are vulnerable to spreading the virus. Feline distemper is found everywhere in the environment and can live for years. The virus can survive anywhere—from the environment it was shed upon to shoes, paws, bedding, bowls, and litter boxes. Feline distemper can survive at freezing temperatures and room temperatures, and can also survive the use of certain disinfectants, including iodine and alcohol. Feline panleukopenia virus is considered one of the deadliest cat diseases in the unvaccinated cat population. Kittens, cats with compromised immune systems, and pregnant cats are at the highest risk to develop severe symptoms of feline distemper. The feline distemper vaccine for cats is a core vaccine , and all cats should be vaccinated against this virus. Feline distemper can be fatal if not properly diagnosed and treated. Health Tools Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps. Symptoms of distemper in cats can range from mild to severe and may include the following: Lethargy Depression Vomiting Diarrhea Painful abdomen (when touched or may appear tense and distended without touch) Dehydration Weight loss Rough or unkempt hair coat Fever Decreased to absent appetite Collapse (in severe cases) Bruising of the skin or gums (in severe cases) Kittens with feline distemper will have mild to severe intention tremors and a wide-based stance. They may fall frequently or seem uncoordinated. Cats become infected with this virus in utero due to their mother becoming infected while pregnant or being exposed to it in their environment. Kittens can also be infected through breast milk when feeding from their mother. Cats with feline distemper will shed viral particles into the environment through feces, urine, saliva, and vomit. Infection occurs when at-risk cats are in contact with these particles. An infected cat sheds the virus for a day or two. Feline distemper can look like many other conditions, such as feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus . Your veterinarian will take a thorough medical history and perform blood work to confirm a diagnosis. Feline panleukopenia is suspected when exposure history is correlated with very low white blood cells and possibly low red blood cells . Fecal testing for feline panleukopenia virus can be performed but is often falsely positive if the cat received a panleukopenia vaccine five to 12 days prior to testing. Virus isolation (a test to find the virus in different tissue samples), antibody levels and PCR testing are also available to help confirm suspicions of feline panleukopenia. There is no specific treatment for feline distemper in cats. Dehydration is treated with intensive intravenous fluid (IV) therapy while symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea are treated with prescription medications. Antibiotic therapy is often instituted to help control any secondary bacterial infections due to low white blood cell counts. However, antibiotics are not used to treat and clear the actual virus. For kittens and cats who appear in shock —or have severe infections—aggressive therapy is started to help treat the symptoms. This usually includes IV fluids and plasma/blood transfusions to keep them hydrated and restore any blood loss or blood pressure abnormalities. If your cat has any abnormalities in their ability to clot their blood, anticoagulant therapies are used (ex: Plavix). Monitoring and treating cats with electrolyte issues from their symptoms is also needed to ensure survival. Nursing care to ensure they stay warm and fed properly is also very important. Keeping these infected cats isolated from others is key to ensure the virus does not spread. Cats with feline distemper who receive and respond well to aggressive therapy typically have a good prognosis for a full recovery. Kittens infected in utero during the early to middle stages of pregnancy usually don’t survive. However, kittens infected in the later stages of pregnancy tend to develop cerebellar hypoplasia but can live happy lives with normal survival times, depending on the severity of the neurological signs. Cats with the following have a poor prognosis and, on average, will pass away within 12 to 24 hours. Low protein levels Low temperatures Thin body conditions Severely low white blood cells on blood work If a cat recovers from feline distemper, there’s usually no permanent damage to their organs, and they develop lifelong immunity to the virus. Since feline panleukopenia is hardy and can remain in the affected environment for a long time, all cages, food/water bowls, toys and bedding should be replaced or thoroughly disinfected. This virus can live on the hands and clothing of humans who encounter it, so washing your hands with soap and water after handling an infected cat minimizes transmission to other cats. To ensure safety, unvaccinated cats should not be placed in an environment frequented by a cat with suspected feline distemper. Probiotics can help maintain proper digestive health while recovering from distemper. Immune boosting supplements are great as well. Intestinal parasites are commonly found in cats with panleukopenia—especially if they came from a shelter. Treating affected cats with deworming medications is necessary during their recovery. Once your cat comes home to recover from distemper, they need to take all medications exactly as prescribed by their veterinarian until finished. Your cat should return to the vet for frequent checkups to ensure they remain healthy. If your cat has any new symptoms or they start to not feel well again, take them back to the vet immediately. Prevention of feline distemper begins with the feline distemper vaccine, which is part of the core vaccine series for cats. Most vaccine protocols recommend at least two doses are given two to four weeks apart, with the last vaccination received when the cat is 14 to 16 weeks old. This vaccination is usually repeated every one to three years, depending on your cat’s lifestyle and the protocols set by your veterinarian. Discuss vaccination with your veterinarian for more details and recommendations. If the cat receives aggressive care through the early stages of this virus, the prognosis for a full recovery is good. There are often no long term effects in older cats but kittens that have developed neurologic symptoms from brain damage ( cerebellar hypoplasia ), might have lasting effects on their coordination. Distemper vaccines are given to kittens starting as early as 6 weeks old (usually given between 6 to 9 weeks old). This vaccine is then boostered every three to four weeks until they are 16 weeks old. Most veterinarians given kittens a total of three FVRCP vaccines to avoid over-vaccination. Older cats then have a FVRCP booster every one to three years, depending on which vaccine your vet carries. Yes! All cats need a distemper vaccine as kittens and then to have it boostered annually thereafter. This core vaccine prevents your cat from developing this potentially deadly disease. Core vaccines are required for every cat because of the widespread and seriousness of these diseases.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_feline_foamy_virus_infection,Feline Foamy Virus Infection in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Feline foamy virus (FeFV) is a complex retrovirus (uses RNA as its DNA) that infects cats, apparently without causing disease. Some strains, however, induce differentiated lymphocytes to burst, suggesting a potential impact on the cat's immune function. Part of the Spumavirus genus, FeFV is relatively rare and is more prevalent in free-roaming cats. The prevalence of the virus in cats also increases with age. Most FeFV-positive cats are asymptomatic and in good health. However, some experts suggest that the infection is linked with myeloproliferative disease and chronic progressive polyarthritis, possibly due to the high likelihood of co-infection with the feline immunodeficiency virus ( FIV ). In these cases, the cat will demonstrate swollen joints, abnormal gait, and enlarged lymph nodes. The way FeFV is transmitted is somewhat under dispute. The high prevalence of infection in some cat populations suggests casual contact may play a role in transmission, but this has not been demonstrated experimentally. Also, since free-roaming cats are at greater risk of FeFV infection, it may be transmitted through bites. It, too, has been discovered to transmit frequently from infected queens to their offspring, probably while still in the womb. Co-infections with FIV and FeLV are fairly common, perhaps due to shared transmission modes and risk factors. Despite this, FeFV co-infection has not been proven to enhance early development of FIV infections. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. A blood sample may be taken for serologic testing, which assist in identifying FeFV antibodies. However, this testing is not readily available and not particularly useful because the correlation between FeFV infection and the disease is so tenuous. Veterinarians may also examine joint fluid from cats with chronic progressive polyarthritis. Currently there is no course of treatment for cats with FeFV infections, except for prescribing immunosuppressive medications to those with chronic progressive polyarthritis. Caution must be used with cats that are also infected with FIV or FeLV. Adverse reactions are unlikely with cats only suffering from FeFV. Animals that also have chronic progressive polyarthritis, on the other hand, often have a poor prognosis for long-term recovery. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_feline_rhinotracheitis,Feline Herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) Infection,"Serhii Hryshchyshen/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Did you just adopt a new cat, and now they’re sneezing? If so, they may have feline herpesvirus (FHV-1). Feline herpes is very common in cats, with over 90% of the cat population being exposed at some point in their life. The good news: the signs of the virus are usually self-limiting and go away after a couple weeks. Feline herpesvirus is a virus affecting a cat’s upper respiratory tract and the structures of their eye. Transmission occurs between cats by direct contact with infected oral, nasal, or eye secretions. Within 24 hours, a newly infected cat can transmit the feline herpes virus to other cats, so it’s important to seek veterinary care immediately. Feline herpesvirus is the most common viral cause of sneezing and nasal discharge in cats . Changes to the structures of the eye are also associated with feline herpes infection. Young cats are most affected by feline herpesvirus, but infection can occur at any age. Cats from multi-cat households, shelters, rescues, and catteries are at increased risk for infection. Outdoor and community cats may become infected from contact with infected cats while outside. Clinical signs can vary in severity. Upper respiratory signs include: Sneezing Nasal discharge Fever Loss of appetite Coughing Changes to the eye may include: Eye discharge Conjunctivitis (pink eye) or chemosis (enlargement of the pink lining of the eye) Changes in the color of the eye Corneal ulcer (scratches or tears of the clear part of the eye) In severe cases, changes to the skin around the face may include: Redness Swelling Crusting Loss of hair Feline herpesvirus is highly contagious and easily spread from cat-to-cat. Cats residing in local shelters, breeding catteries, and pet stores readily pass the virus when they sneeze. The virus can even be on the hands or clothes of the humans who help care for these cats while they’re waiting on their forever home. Feline herpesvirus attacks the lining of the nose, tonsils, conjunctiva (lining of the eye), and cornea (visible part of the eyeball). As the virus continues to make copies of itself, it may be spread through secretions or close direct contact. If not treated early, the virus can infiltrate the bones associated with the nose and mouth, causing long-term physical damage. To diagnose feline herpesvirus, vets will perform a PCR test, which is conducted on swabs from deep in the mouth, the eye, or on biopsies from the skin . This test, however, does not differentiate between the active form of infection and a chronic carrier state. A positive result could mean the pet was infected from another sick cat and is now a carrier of the virus, the pet has been vaccinated for feline herpes, or the pet is showing signs from an active infection of feline herpes. Therefore, a diagnosis is usually made based on a physical exam , as well as a cat’s symptoms and history. Treatment of feline herpesvirus depends on the severity of disease and a cat’s vaccination status , age, and underlying health conditions. Currently, there are no specific medications for the herpes virus in cats; however, in severe cases, human antiviral medications, like famciclovir , can help. Famciclovir may reduce clinical signs and decrease the virus shedding in the secretions of infected cats. For pets with symptoms affecting the eye, topical eye medications , like terramycin ointment or tobramycin drops , may be used to treat any secondary bacterial eye infections. Supportive care is the foundation of treating pets affected by the feline herpesvirus. Supportive care is aimed at decreasing more severe symptoms like pneumonia and physical damage to the nose and eye structures. Typically, the virus is active for seven to 10 days. In mild cases, pets may require no treatment as symptoms improve. Supportive care can include fluids for hydration and routine cleaning of the nostrils and eyes (if they are affected). Also, lysine immune supplements decrease the virus’s ability to replicate. These supplements are available as a powder, paste, or treat. Probiotics with Enterococcus faecium support the immune system. In severe cases, a cat may need to be stabilized in the hospital before supportive care can be started at home. Since antibiotics work against bacteria, they are not used in every case of infection with the feline herpes virus. If a secondary bacterial infection is present, antibiotics are used to fight that infection while the virus runs its course. Clavamox or azithromycin may be prescribed in kitties suffering from secondary bacterial upper respiratory infections. When feline herpesvirus is caught early, most cats with symptoms will recover in 10-14 days with supportive care. Death may occur with severe disease symptoms, especially in kittens and cats that are immunosuppressed. In severe cases, or when cats are affected when very young, physical damage to the bony structures of the face can occur, causing deformities and scarring. That physical damage predisposes affected cats to further complications like pneumonia, chronic nasal disease, and recurrent flares of infection. You can help prevent feline herpesvirus in your pet by doing the following: Isolate sick cats. Separate cats showing signs of an upper respiratory disease, or those with abnormal eye discharge, from other cats. When separated, allow your affected pet to have use of an individual water bowl, food bowl , litter box , toys , and bedding . Clean shared spaces and items. FHV-1 is very susceptible to disinfectants. The feline herpes virus survives only 18 hours outside of the host. It’s easily inactivated by bleach. Reduce stressors. Provide cats that are housed together enough space to drink and eat and use a litter box without crowding or aggression . Maintain a normal routine of deworming , enrichment , and rest. Adding pheromone therapy (like Feliway ) reduces stress for cats. It’s possible for vaccinated cats to become infected with the feline herpes virus and become chronic carriers. But when vaccinated, those cats develop milder symptoms and shed less of the virus for a shorter amount of time compared to unvaccinated cats. Yes, feline herpesvirus is very contagious to other cats. Because the virus is very common, most cats have already been exposed at some point in their life. Most cats exposed to FHV-1 will live long, normal life spans. No, FHV-1 is not contagious to humans. FHV-1 is not curable, but it does go into remission and most cats appear normal. Yes, a cat with herpes can be around other cats. Ideally, wait to bring them around other cats for two weeks until they are no longer symptomatic. Feline herpesvirus can be treated at home with lots of rest and recovery. Minimize stress and make sure your cat has plenty of fresh food and water.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/feline-hyperesthesia-syndrome,Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome (Twitchy Cat Syndrome),"AlexKane/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Feline hyperesthesia syndrome (FHS)—also called rolling skin disease and twitchy cat syndrome—generally involves muscle contractions that a cat can’t control, along with changes in their behavior. Feline hyperesthesia syndrome is a disease in cats that remains poorly understood and may have neurological, psychological, or dermatological (skin) causes . Hyperesthesia refers to an increased sensitivity to touch. Cats with FHS have an overreaction to having their skin touched, most often in the lower back area. A variety of other conditions that can look very similar must be ruled out before feline hyperesthesia syndrome is diagnosed. A cat with feline hyperesthesia syndrome typically has intermittent bursts or episodes of signs lasting 20 to 30 seconds. During these episodes, you may observe any of the following symptoms: Rippling or twitching of skin on the lower back (both after touch and for no apparent reason) Dilated pupils Brief bursts of jumping and running, as if startled Drooling Excessive meowing and other noises Urination Tail-chasing Biting or licking the lower back, sides, hind paws, rear, or tail Pain or discomfort when petted or touched Tiredness If you touch your cat during an FHS episode, you could make the signs worse, and your cat might become aggressive . Your cat will not have control over their reaction. If you notice your cat’s back twitching or any of the other signs listed above, it’s best to stay calm and try not to handle your cat, even though the signs can be severe and even frightening. Veterinary professionals and researchers aren’t currently sure what causes feline hyperesthesia syndrome. Because different cats with hyperesthesia respond to different types of treatment, there may be multiple underlying causes. In some cats, feline hyperesthesia syndrome is diagnosed along with another underlying condition. Causes of feline hyperesthesia syndrome are usually considered dermatological (skin problems), neurological (problems with the nervous system), or psychological (mental health problems). Each of these may have different triggers for FHS episodes. Dermatological Causes of FHS Allergies , including food hypersensitivity Immune-system-related disease Neurological Causes of FHS Seizures Neuropathic (nerve) pain IVDD (intervertebral disc disease/extrusions) Psychological Causes of FHS Displacement behavior Compulsive behavior Attention-seeking behavior Feline hyperesthesia syndrome can happen in any cat, though it may be found more frequently in Abyssinian , Burmese , Persian , and Siamese cats. FHS is also more common among younger cats. If your cat is showing mild to moderate signs of feline hyperesthesia syndrome, contact your vet within 24 hours. If a severe episode occurs and lasts longer than two to three minutes, take your cat to an emergency vet as soon as possible, particularly if self-injury is occurring. Your vet may perform the following tests: A dermatological (skin) workup to identify possible flea allergies , even if your cat does not go outdoors. The skin workup will also seek to rule out environmental and food allergies, underlying skin infections, and acral lick granulomas. Blood work to rule out hyperthyroidism, which has been associated with increased arousal and overgrooming . An evaluation for pain or a neurological condition, such as spinal arthritis. A behavioral evaluation to rule out conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Medication trials may be part of the workup process. When cats are under stress, they can be very good at hiding signs of pain or discomfort. Evaluating their response to a medication targeting pain or itchiness, for example, can provide valuable information. Keep in mind that FHS can occur in conjunction with a skin, neurologic, or behavioral disorder. Diagnosing your cat with one of these conditions does not mean they don’t also have feline hyperesthesia syndrome. Once other conditions have been ruled out and feline hyperesthesia is diagnosed, your veterinarian may need to consult with or refer you to a veterinary behaviorist for a full treatment plan. Your treatment plan may include: Because FHS-type behaviors can result from stress or anxiety brought on by changes in the home, your veterinarian may discuss ways to alleviate your cat’s anxiety in the home. Other behavioral medications like amitriptyline may be recommended. Skin supplements like omega-3 fatty acids or anti-anxiety supplements could be used, but you must get all supplements approved by your veterinarian before adding them to your pet’s daily regimen. Behavioral modification will involve desensitizing your cat to specific stimuli over time or otherwise using techniques to shape behavior. Veterinary behaviorists may have good behavior modification suggestions for your FHS cat. The purpose of treatment is to make changes that help reduce the number of episodes. Behavior modification will give your cat a different emotional response or behavior to perform during times of stress. In one study , six out of seven cats showed significant improvement with medication, and five cats had resolution with just one medication. For some cats with hyperesthesia, the episodes may come back after several months. For others, the relief lasts much longer. FHS often requires lifelong management to prevent recurrence of episodes. For cats whose episodes are triggered by stress or anxiety, management will include keeping a low-stress home and making any changes to your cat’s environment slowly over time whenever possible. Cats on anti-anxiety medications may require their medications for life. Not all cases of FHS are preventable. In many cases, no preventable predisposing cause is found. You can prevent hyperesthesia brought on by parasites by keeping your cat on year-round flea and tick preventives . Keeping your cat indoors also decreases their risk of flea infestation. When making big changes in the home, such as the addition of a new child or partner, consider how to avoid triggering stress and anxiety by altering the home slowly ahead of the change. You might speak with your veterinarian about short-term anxiety medications ahead of big life changes to help your cat cope during times of change. Often, there is no known predisposing trigger for hyperesthesia in cats. Prior trauma with overt stimulation of nerves (maladaptive pain) or conflicting needs leading to obsessive-compulsive behavior are typically causes of hyperesthesia, which can be brought on by skin conditions, neurologic conditions, pain or mental health conditions. Based on the intense reaction that cats with hyperesthesia must touch, it's been suggested that touch may be painful to them. In some cases, hyperesthesia is brought on by pain, as well. There is extreme variability in how cats with hyperesthesia are treated. While there is no true cure, the goal is to lessen episodes, limit the number of seizures present (if any), and prevent self-mutilation while treating pain. As cats can be painful when touched, take caution so you are not bitten in response. If noted, do not continue the action. Instead, try to distract your cat with a treat or food or playing a game with them. You may want to place a t-shirt or recovery cone to prevent the chewing/licking so as not to cause self-harm. Most commonly, your cat will exhibit signs of pain or irritation when being petted, especially towards their hind end. The skin may twitch, and your cat may even try to chase or bite at her tail or jump and run. 1. Ruiz-Suarez N, Bhatti S, Hermans M, da Silva C, Hesta M.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/feline-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-hcm-cats,Feline Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in Cats,"iStock/AzmanL Like the human heart, the feline heart has four chambers—two smaller chambers on the top, the left and right atrium, and two larger chambers on the bottom, the left and right ventricle. The function of the right atrium is to pump deoxygenated blood from the body into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to pick up more oxygen for use by the body and release carbon dioxide for disposal. The function of the left atrium is to pump oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left ventricle, which then pumps the blood back to the body to allow proper cellular and organ function. Because the left ventricle needs to push oxygenated blood to the body, its muscular walls are thicker than those of the right ventricle. When the walls of the left ventricle become fully enlarged and excessively thickened, the result is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) . The narrowing of the inner chamber of the left ventricle, due to this muscular thickening, prevents it from filling properly and decreases its efficiency. As a result, less oxygen-rich blood can reach the body to keep it functioning correctly and it causes the heart to beat faster than normal, increasing its need for oxygen and causing the death of heart muscle cells. This can also hamper heart function. HCM is the most common heart disease in cats. As many as 1 in 7 cats will develop HCM at some point in their lives, and most show no symptoms. One of the most common causes is an inherent disease of the heart muscle itself. This is often related to a genetic predisposition to HCM that is present in several cat breeds, including: Maine Coons Persians Ragdolls Chartreux Sphynx Norwegian Forest Bengals Turkish Vans American Shorthairs British Shorthairs These breeds are most affected by HCM because they are more likely to carry a mutation in a gene called A31P that is involved in maintaining healthy heart muscles. In cats that have two abnormal copies of this gene, death of heart muscle cells and scar tissue in the wall of the left ventricle occurs, which prevents the heart from functioning properly. In addition to genetics, there can be several medical causes of HCM in cats. Hormonal conditions such as hyperthyroidism or acromegaly (excessive secretion of a growth hormone because of a tumor in the anterior pituitary gland near the brain) can stimulate growth of the muscular walls of the left ventricle. Cancer in the heart can also increase the size and thickness of the walls of the left ventricle. Other diseases unrelated to the heart, such as kidney disease , can cause high blood pressure in the body, which puts additional strain on the left ventricle as it works harder than normal to pump blood to the body against elevated pressure in the vessels. Over time, this increased effort causes the ventricle walls to become thicker, and the interior chamber narrower. Signs of HCM in cats may include: Loss of appetite Heart murmur Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) Blood clots, which can cause pain/vocalization, trouble walking, cold rear limbs, vomiting, and trouble breathing Heart failure Fluid in lungs , causing crackles and wheezes when breathing Difficulty breathing Fluid in abdomen ( ascites ), causing visible abdominal swelling Abnormal gum color—pale, gray, or blue gums Blue foot pads and nailbeds Weak or unstable pulse Tiring easily during play/exercise Lethargy /weakness Fainting/collapse Sudden death A veterinarian will start with a thorough physical exam, focusing on listening to the heart and lungs for any abnormal heart rhythms, murmurs, and any excessive crackling and wheezing during breathing. They will also examine the cat’s feet and nail beds for signs of poor circulation, feeling carefully for any weak or unsteady pulses in the limbs, as well as look for any abnormal colors in the gums, such as blue, gray, or pale. The cat’s overall demeanor and ability to walk will also be assessed. HCM can cause lethargy and trouble walking in some cats, particularly if the cat has developed secondary blood clots because of it. Following the physical exam, blood work , including a thyroid panel, will be performed to determine if there is a medical condition that might cause HCM. A cat X-ray may be helpful in screening for HCM, but it can be missed, depending upon the angle of the image. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can also be used to pick up any abnormal heart rhythms. The best way to diagnose HCM in cats is the echocardiogram, an ultrasound of the heart that allows a fuller picture of the thickness of the left ventricle, the flow of blood between heart chambers, and other features of heart function that are best examined as the heart is pumping in real time. A variety of medications may help cats that have HCM including: Clopidogrel : medication that helps prevent blood clots. Diltiazem : a medication that can prevent some fluid buildup and reduce the thickness of the left ventricular wall in some cats. Beta blockers : medications such as atenolol can help cats with severe HCM by slowing heart rate in cats with tachycardia (an overly fast heart rate), correcting abnormal heart rhythms, and improving the function of the valves between the chambers of the heart. Beta blockers can also decrease blood pressure in cats with hypertension. ACE inhibitors : medications such as benazepril are often prescribed to cats with HCM who have heart failure. It can reduce blood pressure. Aspirin : used to thin the blood and prevent clotting in cats with HCM. It’s important that pet parents never give over-the-counter medications to their cats without a veterinarian's approval. Warfarin : another blood-thinning medication that can help prevent blood clots Furosemide or Lasix : a common medication prescribed for cats who have congestive heart failure due to HCM. Spironolactone : another diuretic medication that is used in cats with HCM and heart failure to remove fluid buildup. Spironolactone is often used along with Lasix®. Nitroglycerin ointment : can be applied inside the ears of cats to treat severe fluid buildup when administered along with Lasix. It can also improve blood flow to the body by relaxing the ventricles and arteries, so they are able to accommodate more blood. Pimobendan : can help increase the function of the left atrium and left ventricle during the pumping phase of the heart cycle, when the heart is pushing blood from the left ventricle to the body. In addition to medications, some cats may need routine pleurocentesis, a procedure that removes excess fluid from the lungs. Cats with severe, acute HCM and heart failure may need oxygen therapy in the hospital. Cats that suddenly develop heart failure may benefit from being put under anesthesia, intubated, and helped to breathe if respiratory failure occurs. Anxious cats may be given sedatives such as acepromazine to keep them calm, as stress can cause breathing difficulties and increase the risk of heart failure in cats with HCM. Unfortunately, HCM in cats has no cure. Cats with no symptoms may live a normal lifespan, but the disease usually worsens. If symptoms develop, cats will generally survive for about two more years. Survival time is generally shorter, perhaps only six months or less, for cats that have blood clots, congestive heart failure , and/or low body temperature. If your cat requires hospitalization, a few things can be done when your cat is home to maintain your cat stable for as long as possible. Stress can hinder breathing and increase the risk of heart failure in cats. It is important to set up a quiet space for your cat where he can rest away from any noise and activity of people and other pets. Providing easy access to food, water, litter boxes , and soft perches near windows can benefit your cat immensely. Diet is another factor that can improve the quality of life for cats with HCM. Because HCM, especially with congestive heart failure, can cause loss of appetite, it is essential that cats be fed a high-quality, enticing food that is high in protein. This may require switching from wet food to dry food or vice versa. Low-sodium broths or food toppers such as Wellness Bowl Boosters can encourage cats with lower appetites to eat more. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish oils, can decrease inflammation that is often responsible for muscle wasting and low appetite in cats. A liquid supplement such as Nutramax Welactin is a great addition to your cat’s food. Cats on medications for congestive heart failure may lose too much vitamin B in their urine and require vitamin B supplements . Work closely with your veterinarian to determine what the best diet and supplements may be for your cat, based on their condition. Since HCM can be inherited or may be the result of other medical conditions, the disease is difficult to prevent. Reputable breeders should test susceptible cat breeds for mutations in the A31P gene so that kittens produced from breeding stock do not inherit two mutated copies of the gene. General care and proper nutrition for all cats can go a long way to supporting heart health and prolonging the asymptomatic stage of HCM. It is crucial for higher-risk cats (senior cats, cats with predisposed conditions, cats with the A31P gene) to be screened annually for any signs of heart disease. If you are concerned about HCM in your cat, it’s best to speak with your veterinarian about his overall risk, which diagnostic tests are most appropriate, and how often those tests are needed. Your veterinarian can also assist with developing a wellness and nutrition plan at home to ensure your cat has the best and longest possible life. 1. Kittleson, Mark.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/feline-idiopathic-cystitis-fic-cats,Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) in Cats,"Feline idiopathic cystitis, also known as feline interstitial cystitis or FIC for short, is a type of feline lower urinary tract disease that causes inflammation of the bladder in cats. “Idiopathic” means that the cause of the disease process is unknown; “interstitial” refers to the location of the inflammation in the interstitium, which is the space between the cells in the bladder. This inflammation leads to a thickening of the bladder wall, which can be seen on an ultrasound or during cystoscopy (a procedure in which a scope is used to view the bladder). FIC causes symptoms that mimic a urinary tract infection (UTI). The key difference: a UTI is caused by bacteria, while FIC is considered a sterile disease (no bacteria are present). That doesn’t mean FIC is harmless, however. If the inflammation becomes severe enough, it can cause an obstruction (blockage ) of the urinary tract and prevent your cat from being able to urinate, which is a medical emergency. If you notice your cat is straining to urinate, contact your nearest animal hospital immediately. Common symptoms of FIC may include: Straining to urinate Urinating more often (more frequent trips to the litter box) Urinating smaller amounts more frequently Blood in the urine Urinating outside the litter box, especially on cool, smooth surfaces such as tile or hardwood floors Licking excessively at the genital region Crying out or meowing while urinating Lack of energy Decreased appetite Vomiting or diarrhea Decreased social interaction (hiding) If your cat’s urethra (the tube through which urine leaves the body) has become obstructed (blocked), they will produce little to no urine and cry out often. They also will likely exhibit many of the other signs listed above. This is a medical emergency. Please seek veterinary care immediately. No one knows what causes FIC. Idiopathic means that the cause of a disease process is unknown. FIC occurs most often in young- to middle-aged cats that are less than 10 years old. Cats that are overweight are also at higher risk. Male cats are most prone to this problem, but females can also develop it. Experts believe that stress plays a role, as cats who experience sudden changes to their routine or environment and cats that live in multi-cat households are more likely to develop FIC. FIC is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that your vet will diagnose it only after ruling out all other potential conditions that might cause similar symptoms. This process can be expensive and stressful, but it is necessary. Conditions to rule out before diagnosing FIC include: Urinary tract infection (UTI) Urethral obstruction (blockage of the urethra); this can also occur secondary to FIC Cancer Acute kidney injury Idiopathic renal hematuria, a rare condition that causes kidney bleeding Blood clotting disorders Toxin ingestion Prostate disease (rare in cats) In order to check for these other conditions, your vet might recommend one or more of the following tests: Your vet will use a small needle to penetrate your cat’s bladder and collect a sterile sample of urine that is analyzed in a lab. (A “free catch” sample—which entails collecting urine after your cat has voided naturally—can be used, but it won’t be sterile and might lead to a false positive for a UTI.) If your cat has a UTI, lab analysis will detect bacteria in the urine. In a cat with FIC, the results will likely be abnormal (crystals, blood, protein, white blood cells, or skin cells may be present in the urine), but bacteria won’t be present. This takes urinalysis a step further by placing the sample in a petri dish and keeping it in a warm, dark incubator to allow any bacteria that might be present to grow. It’s the most accurate way to ensure your cat does not have a UTI. If your cat does have a UTI, the bacteria grown will be tested against different antibiotics to determine which ones would be most effective to treat the UTI. This test compares the level of protein in the urine to the level of creatinine, a substance excreted by the kidneys. In healthy cats, the amount of protein is significantly less than the amount of creatinine. UPC is often elevated in cats with FIC. A basic imaging test is often used to look for both bladder and/or kidney stones. Sometimes contrast dye is used so that the vet can see whether the urethra is blocked or thickened. This test uses soundwaves instead of radiation to look for abnormalities in the bladder and kidneys, including stones. Your vet will put a scope (thin tube with an attached camera) into the urethra and bladder to view the bladder wall and check for cancer. This is a type of surgery in which the bladder is cut open so your vet can look for signs of cancer and take samples of the bladder wall to send to a lab for analysis. Urethrocystoscopy and exploratory cystotomy are typically reserved for cats that experience persistent or frequent, recurrent episodes of FIC and are used primarily to rule out bladder cancer, which is rare in cats. Because the cause of FIC is unknown, there’s no medication that directly treats it. The most important aspect of managing FIC is to ease your cat’s discomfort. Your vet might prescribe pain relievers such as butorphanol or buprenorphine, which are low-dose opioids. Gabapentin is a drug in a different class that may also be used to control pain. If your cat’s urethra is blocked, it will require much more extensive treatment. After the initial emergent treatment, some of the medications your vet might prescribe include, but are not limited to acepromazine, prazosin or phenoxybenzamine, which are medications designed to help the urethra relax. Unfortunately, one of the main causes of the blockage is inflammation, and these medications don’t address the underlying inflammation. Given that inflammation is a big part of FIC, you might assume that your vet would advise taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like meloxicam. Unfortunately, no studies have demonstrated that NSAIDs help with FIC. Some vets also recommend injections of a polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (PSGAG) such as Adequan. This is a drug that is typically used for joint issues to help prevent the breakdown of cartilage in the joint. However, the bladder also happens to be lined by this substance. In cats with FIC, recent studies have shown that they have a breakdown of the PSGAG layer on the bladder wall, and the injections may help to replace it. While it hasn’t been directly proven, it is suspected that PSGAG injections may help cats to recover faster from an FIC episode. There are several things that can be done to help your cat recover from FIC and prevent future episodes. One change is a switch to a prescription diet that is high in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, which combat inflammation. Your vet might recommend Hill’s c/d, Hill’s c/d Multicare Urinary Stress, Royal Canin Urinary SO, or Royal Canin Multicare Urinary and Calm. It has not been proven but drinking more water might help prevent FIC from returning. Feeding your cat an exclusively wet-food diet and using a water fountain may help to increase water consumption. Cats tend to like running water better than still water. Environmental enrichment helps to decrease stress in cats, which is suspected to be a major factor involved in causing FIC. Increase more activity time with your cat, and consider providing extra climbing structures, viewing, and resting perches, and scratching posts. Also make sure that you’re frequently changing the litterbox and that you have an appropriate number of litterboxes in your home. It may surprise you, but the recommended number of litterboxes is one more than the number of cats you have. A synthetic version of a calming cat pheromone Feliway may help to decrease stress and, in turn, reduce the chances of future FIC episodes. L-Tryptophan and Alpha-Casozepine are supplements that may help to decrease stress in cats, but more research on them is needed. Acupuncture might also help cats who routinely experience FIC. Symptoms can usually go away on their own in five to seven days unless the urethra becomes blocked. No. It’s unclear why some cats have recurrent episodes, but others do not. Research has shown that 46% of cats who have an episode will never have another one, but an unlucky 12% have more than six recurrences. Cats can recover from an episode of FIC. However, approximately 50% of them will have a recurrent episode within one year, so they should be monitored closely. They can have a normal lifespan, as long as FIC is managed and treated appropriately.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/feline-infectious-peritonitis,"Feline Infectious Peritonitis: Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment of FIP in Cats","iStock/mediaphotos Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a rare disease in cats, but its effects are devastating. FIP in cats causes a variety of symptoms, which makes it difficult to diagnose. Until recently, FIP was almost always considered fatal. Fortunately, recent treatments have seriously improved outcomes for affected cats. Let’s look at what FIP in cats is, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available. Feline infectious peritonitis is an immune-mediated disease caused by a mutated feline coronavirus. This virus causes a cat’s immune system to overreact, triggering an inflammatory response that damages blood vessels in the body and causes significant swelling of the organs. Cats with FIP have a variety of symptoms. These symptoms can vary greatly between cats depending on how their immune systems react to the virus. This disease is life-threatening because of a cat’s inappropriate immune reaction to the virus. There are two forms of FIP, which cause different symptoms. FIP in cats can be either “wet” or “dry.” Wet FIP: This refers to fluid buildup within the cat’s body, primarily the chest and abdomen. This leads to breathing issues and swelling. Dry FIP: This refers to the development of significant inflammation in various organs like the brain and eyes. Cats with dry FIP display a large variety of symptoms. Symptoms of FIP in cats depend on the type an affected cat has. Early symptoms of both “dry” and “wet” feline infectious peritonitis include weight loss , diarrhea , decreased appetite , fever , and lethargy . As the disease progresses, more symptoms develop, including the following: Wet FIP Enlarged abdomen Increased heart rate Difficulty breathing Bluish gums Enlarged lymph nodes Yellow discoloration of the skin Dry FIP Eye redness Cloudy eyes Bleeding in the eyes Squinting Blindness Seizures Incoordination Walking in circles Head tilt Enlarged lymph nodes FIP is caused by exposure to a feline enteric (intestinal) coronavirus. The exact way this virus causes FIP is unknown. However, it is thought that the virus becomes mutated and causes an abnormally large immune response in affected cats, leading to significant damage to organs and blood vessels. The virus is generally spread when a cat ingests something carrying FIP, such as feces. Less commonly, inhalation or spread through saliva or mucus can occur. This may happen if cats lick or groom one another or share water bowls. Because of this, cats living close to other cats, such as in shelters or multi-cat households, are at a higher risk for infection. FIP affects cats of all ages, but it’s most common in young cats ages 6 months to 2 years. Males are also more likely to become infected, especially if they are unneutered . Purebred cats, such as Himalayans , Persians , and Abyssinians , are at an increased risk of getting FIP, possibly due to a genetic predisposition and breeding conditions. To diagnose FIP, veterinarians start with a complete physical exam to find any obvious abnormalities, such as changes to the eyes, a distended abdomen, and abnormal heart or respiratory (breathing) rates. Because of the variety of symptoms that cats may have, it can be hard to diagnose feline infectious peritonitis. More testing may include: Blood work . A small sample of blood is taken from a cat’s vein to check overall health and find signs of infection from the virus or related inflammation. Imaging. Radiographs ( X-rays ) and ultrasound can show fluid within the abdomen or chest that may indicate FIP. Fine needle aspirate (FNA). A veterinarian uses a small needle to gently take a sample of cells from the desired area, such as the liver, to check for the presence of coronavirus. Fluid analysis. A veterinarian may use a small needle to take fluid from the abdomen, chest, or spine to check it for the virus and abnormal cells. Histopathology. This is the only way to definitively diagnose feline infectious peritonitis. Because it is difficult to diagnose FIP in living cats, histopathology is done primarily using tissue samples after a cat’s death. These samples may include lymph nodes or parts of organs to find evidence of the virus and immune cells that indicate FIP. Treatment options are limited for FIP in cats. Until recently, there was no effective treatment for feline infectious peritonitis. However, therapies have now been developed that are effective for feline infectious peritonitis. Remdesivir and GS-441524 are two treatment options that have shown promise in treating FIP well, but they are not yet widely available. These treatments are given for at least three months by injection or orally. Supportive care can be helpful for affected cats, including: Thoracentesis to drain fluid from the chest Abdominocentesis to drain fluid from the abdomen Anti-inflammatories, such as prednisolone Immunosuppressants, such as cyclophosphamide Fluid therapy Nutritional support, such as a feeding tube Click here to download this medical illustration. Appetite stimulants, such as mirtazapine Vitamin B12 Cats who do not get treatment for FIP will die of the disease within 10 days or less in most cases. The survival time of cats with wet feline infectious peritonitis is generally days to weeks, while dry FIP has a longer survival time of weeks to months. If they get treatment, cats have a good chance for recovery, but more studies are needed on the currently available therapies to fully understand how well they work. Minimizing stress in the environment can support a healthy immune system, which can lower the risk of cats developing FIP. Providing enough litter boxes (one more than the number of cats in the given area) and thoroughly cleaning them can reduce spread of the virus. Additionally, thorough disinfection of areas where many cats live, such as shelters, is needed to remove viral particles from the environment. In multi-cat households, frequently cleaning bedding, food and water bowls, litter boxes, and other shared items can reduce the spread of FIP. The first signs of FIP in cats can vary but may include lethargy, weight loss, diarrhea, fever, and decreased appetite. Many cats with FIP can survive if seen by a veterinarian right away and given the right treatment. Some cats can harbor the coronavirus that causes FIP long-term and intermittently shed it in their saliva and feces. Therefore, in multi-cat households there is still a risk for infection even if the cats are indoor-only. Indoor cats can get FIP after exposure to the coronavirus from sharing litter boxes or food and water bowls with other cats in the household. Cats are thought to get FIP after their immune systems overreact to a mutated form of the feline coronavirus. The survival time for kittens with FIP varies greatly depending on how severe the symptoms are at diagnosis and how quickly treatment is given. Cats with FIP have reduced or absent appetites because of nausea and inflammation within the body. Fluid buildup within the body can also lead to a cat feeling more full than normal. FIP itself is not contagious between cats, but the feline enteric coronavirus that causes it is. This is why proper disinfection of the environment and cleaning litter boxes is so important, especially in multi-cat households and shelters. Feline Infectious Peritonitis. Merck Veterinary Manual.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/feline-leukemia-virus-felv,Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV),"Feline leukemia virus is a common disease that affects about 2% of cats in the United States. It is spread cat-to-cat and leads to the destruction of the cat’s white blood cells and immune system. This leaves them more susceptible to infection, cancer, and death. Widespread vaccination has led to an overall decrease in leukemia cases; however, it remains a major disease in cats who frequent the outdoors. The leukemia virus attacks the cat’s blood cells by invading tissue that makes up the blood cells, including bone marrow and lymph tissue. Blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) play an important role in keeping the body supplied with oxygen and nutrients. These cells help fight infections and eliminate waste products. White blood cells are especially important in helping the immune system, and special types of white blood cells are called to action when a cat is fighting an illness. When a cat is infected with feline leukemia virus, its white blood cells have been compromised and are no longer able to help fight off infections. Various skin, respiratory, and urinary infections can develop without a healthy immune system in place. The affected cat is unable to fight off these infections, leading to a shorter life span. The virus also causes mutations leading to cancer, including lymphoma and lymphosarcoma. Clinical signs of feline leukemia virus come from the blood cells being attacked. Initially, cats may show little signs of infection until the virus has strengthened and taken over more of their immune system. Over time, clinical signs may become more involved as cats develop cancers secondary to the leukemia virus. The most common clinical signs of feline leukemia virus are: Pale gums (anemia) Decreased appetite Weight loss Unthrifty coat (poorly groomed, dry, brittle) Inflamed gums and mouth (gingivitis and stomatitis) Fever Enlarged lymph nodes Chronic diarrhea Chronic skin, eye, respiratory, or urinary tract infections FeLV in cats is spread through saliva. It is spread most commonly from those exposed to one another for longer periods of time through mutual grooming, mating, or shared food/water/litter boxes. It may also be spread by bite wounds and from a mother to her kittens through the placenta. A cat at any age can be infected with feline leukemia virus through exposure. Allowing an unvaccinated cat to be unsupervised while outdoors may expose it to infected cats. Bringing a new cat into the home that has not tested negative for the feline leukemia virus may also spread the disease. Fortunately, the virus is not very hardy in the environment and can only survive on surfaces for a couple of hours. Transmission usually occurs from direct contact between cats. Feline leukemia virus is not contagious to people or to other pets, like dogs or rabbits. Feline leukemia is usually diagnosed by a test that requires a small amount of blood, called an ELISA test. This test is quick and routinely done in veterinary clinics. Your veterinarian may recommend repeating the test if they get a positive result, especially in young cats and kittens. Repeating the test 8 to 12 weeks later helps to confirm if an infection is persistent. Some cat immune systems can eliminate the virus when they are first exposed. About 20 to 30 percent of cats will eliminate the virus successfully when they're first exposed. FeLV undergoes several stages. In the first stage, infected cats show very little signs of disease as the virus enters their mouths and replicates on their tonsils. A little less than one-third of cats can eliminate the virus in this stage—if their immune system is healthy. For the remaining two-thirds of cats, the virus will spread to the lymph tissue and intestines, leading to shedding of viral particles in the feces in addition to the saliva. In advanced stages of the disease, it infects the bone marrow as well. Once the virus gets into the bone marrow it cannot be cleared and these cats are persistently infected for life. Unfortunately, feline leukemia virus does not have a cure. Affected cats are managed medically by treating any secondary infections that can result from the disease. Cats infected with feline leukemia virus often develop secondary skin, upper respiratory tract, eye, or urinary tract infections due to their immune system being compromised. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat any secondary bacterial infections that may be present. Sometimes appetite stimulants or anti-inflammatory medications are prescribed in leukemia cat pet patients who have a poor appetite or fever. Occasionally, blood transfusions may be recommended for continued quality life for cats with severe anemia. If your cat tests positive for feline leukemia virus, it is important to limit its exposure to secondary infections. It is best that she remains indoors only and does not have access to other cats that may have spreadable diseases. While a simple upper respiratory tract infection may be easily cleared by a healthy cat’s immune system, feline leukemia patients have a compromised immune system and will require more aggressive treatment and earlier intervention with antibiotics. Any illness, no matter how small, is a threat to a compromised immune system. Some cats diagnosed with FeLV can live normal lives for years, especially if they are kept indoors with minimal exposure to secondary illnesses. The average life span after testing positive for leukemia virus is less than three years. If your cat has feline leukemia and is allowed access to the outdoors, be sure it is under supervision. It is also important to prevent any cat interactions, such as fighting. If your cat enjoys the outdoors, but you want to limit its exposure to the elements, consider a catio . Always avoid allowing shared food/water bowls and litter boxes between affected and non-affected cats to reduce risk of transmission. Management of a cat with feline leukemia may require more frequent cleaning of the eyes and ears to keep them free of debris. Secondary skin, respiratory, eye, ear and urinary tracts can be common in cats with compromised immune systems, so it’s helpful to keep them clean. Commercial ear cleaners, like Epi-Otic or Epi-Klean, can be used to clean out any waxy debris in the ear canals. Eye washes can be helpful in keeping the eyes clear. Regular brushing will keep the skin and coat healthy. If any signs of infection are noted, such as green-yellowish drainage in the eyes or nose, lethargy, decreased appetite, cough, increased urination, or inflammation in the ears, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible. Often, vets tend to be more proactive with antibiotics in a cat that has feline leukemia, since its immune system is not as robust. You can reduce your cat’s risk of contracting feline leukemia with regular vaccination . It is recommended that cats who spend any time outdoors—or cats that have exposure to potentially infected cats—get an annual vaccination. The American Association of Feline Practitioners recommends all kittens be vaccinated within their first year. Young kittens start the vaccine series at 8 weeks of age and receive a booster 3 to 4 weeks later. Cats at-risk should continue regular vaccination each year, while low risk indoor-only cats may discontinue the vaccine after the initial series. Vaccinated cats will not test positive on feline leukemia snap tests. If a cat tests positive for feline leukemia, it should not be vaccinated, as it puts excess strain on its immune system. Any new cat should be tested for feline leukemia and FIV prior to being introduced to other cats in the household. Feline leukemia virus is a fatal disease; however, many infected cats can live for several years with good quality of life. Cornell Veterinary Health Center. Feline Leukemia Virus. 2016..

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/feline_idiopathic_lower_urinary_tract_disease,Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD),"iStock/Lightspruch Your cat’s lower urinary tract disease (UTD) can cause them significant pain and discomfort. If it causes obstruction, it can even be life-threatening. Here, we’ll cover what FLUTD is, its symptoms, how the vet diagnoses it, and treatments for a FLUTD cat. Feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) is a term that refers to several conditions affecting a cat’s lower urinary tract, including the bladder and the urethra (a thin tube that carries urine from the body to the external genitals). Feline lower urinary tract disease can be frustrating for both pet parents and veterinarians because the underlying cause can be difficult to identify, and the illness can range in severity. Click here to download this medical illustration. Most cases of feline lower urinary tract disease can be managed with a combination of medications, diet, and environmental changes. Feline lower urinary tract disease can occur in cats at any age, depending on the underlying cause. It’s most often seen in young to middle-aged adult cats. However, it has been diagnosed in kittens and even senior cats who have never shown urinary symptoms. Currently, feline lower urinary tract disease is used as an umbrella term to describe the clinical signs of a few syndromes that can occur on their own or in combination. Some of the conditions that can cause FLUTD include: Urinary tract infection (UTI) Bladder stones Feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC) Urethral obstruction Most causes of FLUTD will be caused by the conditions listed above. Less commonly, FLUTD can occur due to cancer ( bladder or urethra ), structural abnormalities in the urinary tract, injuries, or neurologic issues. The most common symptom of FLUTD is your cat urinating outside the litter box . Inappropriate urination often occurs on clothes, bedding, and rugs. Some cats may choose one location, but others may urinate throughout the home. Your cat may also make very frequent trips to the litter box but only pee small amounts at a time. Other symptoms include vocalizing while urinating and/or the presence of blood in the urine . If you see your cat trying to use the litter box and producing no urine at all, or just a few small drops, bring them to the vet immediately. This may be a sign of the most severe FLUTD syndrome— urethral obstruction . This occurs more commonly in male cats but can occur in females as well. Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Because FLUTD is an umbrella term for lower urinary tract diseases in cats, anything that can cause any of the potential “types” of FLUTD is a potential cause. Urinary tract infections Bladder stones Urethral obstruction: urethral plugs, stones, tumors Feline idiopathic cystitis (underlying cause not definitively known but chronic anxiety thought to play a major role) Tumors in the urinary tract Anatomical abnormalities Injuries/trauma Spinal cord injuries causing neurologic conditions Diagnosis of FLUTD can be tricky and often relies on a combination of a physical exam , test results, and patient history. Your vet will perform a urinalysis to rule out a UTI. Some cases may require a urine culture if the infection is hard to find or does not respond to initial antibiotics. You vet may also perform blood work to look for systemic (whole body) infection, diabetes , and kidney disease . These conditions may have similar symptoms to FLUTD. Stones in the bladder or urethra can usually be found on X-rays , though ultrasounds may be preferred when looking for kidney changes or bladder abnormalities that wouldn’t show up on X-rays. Successful diagnosis and treatment of FLUTD often requires a lot of information about how a cat interacts with their environment at home. Recent behavior changes in your cat are an important part of the diagnosis. You may be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire about how and where your cat eats, sleeps, plays, and interacts with family members, as well as any recent changes to your cat’s environment. These questionnaires can be just as helpful as regular lab tests because they can help identify stressors in your cat’s environment. Treatment of FLUTD is very individual and based on the specific syndrome. Some common treatments include increasing water consumption (feeding wet food or offering a water fountain ), giving your cat more litter box options, and weight loss in overweight cats . Some cats require a combination of therapies or a “multimodal” approach. Here are some more specific treatments your vet may use based on the underlying cause: Antibiotics for UTIs (most common first choice is amoxicillin ) Surgery or veterinary diets for bladder stones Pain medications, veterinary diets, anti-spasmodic medications, and stress management for FIC. Short-term medications like buprenorphine (opioid) and prazosin (anti-spasmodic) may be used during the initial episode. For stress management, you can use pheromone diffusers , food puzzles , cat trees , and water fountains to reduce stress and promote your cat’s happiness. Extreme cases may require anti-anxiety medications , but these are often a last resort. Though improvement of symptoms can occur within days, it’s common for FLUTD to come back, so active management will be a lifelong commitment for a pet parent. Anti-anxiety medications like fluoxetine or sertraline may only be used long-term in severe cases. These medications can take over a month to take effect. In the interim, your cat may take short-acting anti-anxiety medications like gabapentin, Cats that respond well to veterinary diets should stay on them indefinitely. You will work with your veterinarian to adjust treatment accordingly. Sudden changes in your cat’s environment make it much more likely for symptoms to return. You will need to try to anticipate stressful situations for your cat, such as moving or adding new pets or family members to the household. While many cats with FLUTD can live a long and happy life, it’s not uncommon for treatment to fail. For male cats with recurrent obstruction, a surgery to create a new urethral opening in the perineum ( perineal urethrostomy ) may be recommended. Unfortunately, humane euthanasia may be considered for cats with pain that can’t be controlled. Whether there is a “cure” for FLUTD depends on the cause of the disease. For most cats with FLUTD, who experience idiopathic cystitis or urethral obstruction, the exact cause is unknown and supportive care is needed to prevent recurrence. However, if the cat has bladder stones or a urinary tract infection, the individual incident may be curable. Your cat will have a normal lifespan if the disease can be managed well. For cats with recurrent episodes of FLUTD, especially urethral obstruction, quality-of-life decisions may be necessary. Cats with FLUTD show any or all the following clinical signs: urinating outside the litter box, visiting the litter box frequently, straining to urinate, and blood in the urine. Male cats with severe complications may exhibit vomiting, decrease in appetite, and/or hiding—sometimes, with no known urinary symptoms. The time frame depends on the specific type of FLUTD. Urinary infections may clear up in a few days, while FIC may take weeks to months to manage appropriately. There are multiple prescription diets available to help manage FLUTD in cats. These diets are created to increase water intake, change the pH of the urine, reduce the risk of bladder stones, and even help with behavioral management. For situations where a prescription diet is not practical, cats with FLUTD benefit from a diet based on canned food to help increase water intake.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/c_ct_Feline_Tooth_Resorption,Feline Tooth Resorption: Stages and Treatment,"wichayada suwanachun/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Does your cat act like their mouth is bothering them? Are they tilting their head to the side or trying to eat their kibble without chewing? Your cat may have a common condition called feline tooth resorption. Feline resorptive lesions are small holes on the teeth where their body has eaten away part of the tooth, leading to discomfort and pain . Feline tooth resorption occurs when a cat’s body starts to break down and absorb the structures of a tooth. Tooth resorption starts when odontoclast cells begin to attack healthy teeth. Odontoclast cells usually play a healthy role in your cat's mouth when they are young, aiding in breaking down their baby teeth so that they can readily fall out and be replaced by adult teeth. Problems arise when these cells start to attack healthy, adult teeth. Any tooth can be affected by resorption, but the mandibular premolars (bottom cheek teeth) are most affected. Tooth resorption is different from cavities. Cavities are caused by bacteria that create acid. This acid breaks down the enamel and dentin of the tooth, which can kill the tooth. Feline tooth resorption is common in pet cats, with 28.5–67% of cats diagnosed with one or more tooth resorptive lesion. These lesions usually look like small holes in the tooth. They are very painful and your cat may chatter their teeth when they’re touched or probed with a dental instrument. There are two main types of tooth resorption: type 1 and type 2. Let’s look at both. In Type 1 feline tooth resorption, areas of a diseased tooth are resorbed (broken down and absorbed) and then replaced with inflammatory granulation tissue. On dental radiographs ( X-rays ), these areas appear to be less dense than either tooth or bone. In this form of tooth resorption, the roots of the tooth must be removed with the affected crown to avoid any long-term discomfort. Affected teeth look like they have small holes on the crown, but their roots look intact. Cat teeth diseased with Type 2 feline tooth resorption are replaced with a bone-like material. On dental X-rays, these can look like tooth remnants in the bone. As the bone-like material that replaces their root is not painful, the disease crowns of the teeth can be removed without needing to extract the roots as well. Affected teeth have small holes on the crown again, but the roots have melted away and are replaced with bone. This is the most common form of tooth resorption as it’s less painful and affected cats can go a much longer time before pet parents notice something is amiss. There are five stages of feline tooth resorption that progress from a small amount of tissue loss to severe tissue loss. This extends into the tooth until only remnants of dental tissue remain. Veterinarians may evaluate each tooth to determine the type and stage of each lesion. Stage 1: Small lesions on the outside of the tooth affecting the enamel or cementum. Stage 2: Lesions extend beyond white outer enamel part of tooth into the yellow dentin beneath. Stage 3: Lesion involves the pulp cavity, the inner chamber of the tooth. Stage 4: Most of the tooth is eaten away Stage 5: The tooth is mostly gone to the naked eye and only appears as bits of remaining tooth on dental X-rays. While the underlying cause of feline tooth resorption is still unknown, researchers continue to investigate both the process and the cause of tooth resorption. Tooth resorption has not been shown to be related to bacteria in the mouth. Researchers have investigated diets, mineral imbalances, periodontal diseases, vitamin D status, and other factors to identify the cause of feline tooth resorption. Unfortunately, a straightforward answer has not been found. Studies have shown that cats are more likely to have tooth resorption as they age. They have also found that cats that are diagnosed with tooth resorption are more likely to have other teeth affected in the future. Symptoms of feline tooth resorption can range from: Drooling Having difficulty chewing Dropping food while chewing “Chattering” the jaw while eating Running away from the food bowl Many cats with tooth resorption also show no signs of pain or change in behavior at home. Several different conditions can cause oral pain in cats. To diagnose feline tooth resorption, your veterinarian may first rule out conditions like: Periodontal disease Feline chronic gingivostomatitis Pyogenic granulomas Eosinophilic disease These can be ruled out by doing an oral exam. Sedation may be needed to facilitate a thorough oral exam. Your vet will likely recommend taking dental radiographs (X-rays) of your cat’s teeth. Dental x-rays are always done under anesthesia. The sensor used to capture the image cannot be chomped on, or it will break and they are very expensive to replace. It’s difficult to see all the way in the back of a cat’s mouth when they’re awake. Resorptive lesions may not be found until your cat is under anesthesia for their dental cleaning. Your cat may need more teeth extracted than what was expected due to resorptive lesions being found while probing their gum line. If your pet is diagnosed with feline tooth resorption, your veterinarian will likely use dental X-rays while your cat is under anesthesia to make a treatment recommendation. Treatment of teeth with resorptive lesions is to remove the affected tooth. Your vet will treat feline resorption depending on the type: Feline resorption type 1: Type 1 tooth resorptive lesions are treated with extraction of the tooth with the roots (surgical extraction). Feline resorption type 2: Type 2 tooth resorptive lesions can be treated with a crown amputation, which removes the diseased portion of the tooth but leaves the already resorbing roots. Prior to extracting teeth or doing a crown amputation, your veterinarian will perform a local nerve block to reduce the amount of anesthesia your cat needs and to ensure your cat wakes up numb and comfortable. This entails using a needle to inject a local anesthetic, like lidocaine or bupivacaine, into parts of the mouth where the nerves are so that your cat’s mouth is numb. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent feline tooth resorption. Brushing your cat's teeth daily or every other day with a cat-safe toothbrush and toothpaste helps to decrease plaque and bacteria to slow gingivitis and periodontal disease. If your cat begins to show symptoms of pain or is suddenly resistant to tooth brushing, it may be a sign of a dental issue. Taking your cat for their yearly wellness exams , anesthetic dental exams, cleanings, and dental X-rays is the best way to prevent your cat from quietly suffering from tooth resorption. Your veterinarian is your best partner for diagnosis and treatment of feline tooth resorption. While tooth resorption can lead to chronic mouth pain and difficulty eating, it is rarely a cause of death. Left untreated, cats with tooth resorption may experience chronic pain and potentially weight loss if they’re not eating as much. Prolonged periods of anorexia can be dangerous, especially for obese cats. Unfortunately, there is no natural treatment for tooth resorption. Tooth resorption is generally painful for affected cats; however individual cats may respond differently to discomfort from tooth resorption. Some types of tooth resorption are more painful than others. 1.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pulmonary_fibrosis,Fibrotic Hardening of the Lungs in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cats can suffer from many forms of pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis being one of them. The development of this disease results in inflammation and scarring of the tiny air sacs of the cat's lungs and lung tissue. The reactive scarring of the lungs results in fibrotic tissue buildup, where the tissue becomes excessively thick, reducing the ability of the affected sacs to pass oxygen into the blood stream. Therefore, as the disease progresses, less oxygen is passed into the body’s tissues when the cat breathes. The factors which initiate pulmonary fibrosis are still unknown; however, hereditary factors and a variety of micro-injuries to the air sacs are suspected. Recent evidence also suggests abnormal wound healing in the lung as a mechanism for fibrosis. It may exist concurrently with cancer in cats. Affected cats are usually middle-aged or elderly. The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. The signs and symptoms displayed by the cat generally progress slowly; these include: The underlying cause for pulmonary fibrosis is usually unknown (idiopathic). However, it may be also due to: The biggest problem in diagnosing and treating pulmonary fibrosis is that the disease may be far along before symptoms begin to appear. Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and chest X-rays. Other diagnostic tools include an echocardiography to determine whether the heart is enlarged, a computed tomography (CT) scan to view the cat's lungs three dimensionally, and biopsy samples of the affected tissues for microscopic examination. Your cat may need supplemental oxygen; in which case, it will be hospitalized. This is a life-threatening disease and may be terminal if not treated immediately and appropriately. For that reason, treatment will focus on support, and on controlling the symptoms to enhance the quality of life. If the cat is obese, there may be further treatment complications because it can impede ventilation (breathing). Weight loss will lessen symptoms of respiratory impairment. Your veterinarian may prescribe anti-inflammatory dosages of prednisone at first, tapering the dosage over the course of a month if there is no underlying infection. There are also some antifibrotic agents that may be helpful, as well as bronchodilators (drugs made to widen the air passages and relax the bronchial tissues) to assist your cat’s breathing. You will need to eliminate the cat's exposure to dust or fumes. This is a progressive condition with a guarded prognosis; cats with pulmonary fibrosis generally only survive between a few weeks to a few months. Because of the possibility of quick deterioration, cats should be intensively monitored. Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure often develops with any severe, chronic lung disease. Your veterinarian may want to repeat lung biopsies in order to track the cat's progress and the effectiveness of its treatment. A positive response to treatment will result in an increase in mobility. Image: Rommel Canlas via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/fiv-cats,FIV in Cats,"deepblue4you/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that can eventually progress to feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (similar to AIDS in humans ). As those names imply, infection with FIV weakens a cat’s immune system, which makes it much more likely that they’ll come down with bacterial infections , certain types of cancer , autoimmune diseases, or other secondary health problems. While FIV in cats is a serious disease, it’s important to keep two key points in mind: FIV infections aren’t very common. A study of more than 1,500 veterinary hospitals and animal shelters in the US and Canada showed that 3.6% of cats seen tested positive for FIV. This was likely an overestimate of the virus’s prevalence, since it excluded so many healthy cats. Cats with FIV can enjoy many healthy years after diagnosis. An FIV diagnosis in an otherwise healthy cat is not a medical emergency, although it could become one in the future. FIV infections are divided into three phases that can have very different symptoms: Acute phase —During the one to two weeks after a cat has been infected with FIV, a cat can have: Fever Lethargy Enlarged lymph nodes No symptoms Latent phase —After recovering from their first symptoms, cats often go through a period of several months to years when they seem perfectly healthy. However, their immune system is being slowly weakened. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome —At this point, a cat’s immune system has become weak enough that they start developing secondary infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers ( lymphoma and leukemia , for example), and other health problems. Symptoms will vary with the specific secondary disease(s) a cat has, but commonly include: Lethargy Poor appetite Weight loss Redness or sores in the mouth Vomiting Diarrhea Eye inflammation (redness and swelling) and drainage Coughing or sneezing Difficulty breathing Neurologic problems like weakness, seizures , or odd behaviors As time goes on, many of these secondary health problems will get worse and stop responding to treatment. The most common way for cats to become infected with FIV is through bite wounds . A cat with FIV can have large amounts of the virus in their saliva. Cats may also develop FIV after touching an infected cat's saliva through mutual grooming or sharing food and water bowls, but this doesn’t happen often. Cats who haven’t been spayed or neutered may be infected through sexual activity. An infected queen (mother cat) can pass FIV to her kittens while they are growing in her uterus or when they drink her milk that has the virus. It’s possible for some kittens in a litter to be infected while others are not. The most common way to diagnose FIV is with an ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), which uses just a few drops of blood . Results of ELISA tests for FIV are usually correct, but there are times when your vet will decide to run a confirmatory test. A cat was recently exposed to the virus —It can take two to four months for a cat to develop enough antibodies to be found by an ELISA test. The cat is younger than 6 months old —Kittens can pick up antibodies from their mother even if they are not infected, and it may take as long as six months for them to disappear. An apparently healthy cat tests positive for FIV and they have no history of being bitten by another cat —False positive tests are possible. For example, a vaccine for FIV that was stopped in 2016 makes vaccinated but uninfected cats test positive. Be sure to tell your veterinarian about any symptoms you’ve seen at home, your cat’s past and present lifestyle, and your cat’s vaccination history so they can decide if a confirmatory test is needed. Unfortunately, cats cannot be cured of FIV, so treatment centers around managing the other conditions that they might have and keeping them as healthy as possible for as long as possible. A veterinarian may need to run more diagnostic tests to get a better idea of the cat’s overall health and plan proper treatments, which may change over time. General supportive care for cats with FIV includes: Keeping FIV-positive cats indoors so they come across fewer infectious diseases. Giving excellent nutrition and avoiding raw foods that may have pathogens. Quickly treating any diseases that do develop. Plan on checkups every four to six months so health problems can be caught early. Anti-viral drugs such as AZT (azidothymidine or zidovudine) and medications that boost the immune system may be helpful in some cases, but they can also have significant side effects. Your veterinarian can help you figure out if they might be right for your cat. With a dedicated caregiver, cats with FIV often live long and relatively healthy lives. They may never develop acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, but if they do and their symptoms stop responding to treatment, they probably only have a couple of months to live. Humane euthanasia is often the best way to prevent future suffering when a cat’s quality of life is poor and won’t get better. Since FIV in cats is usually transmitted through bites, the best form of prevention is to keep cats from fighting by keeping them indoors. It’s also important that any cat who has been diagnosed with FIV not be let outdoors so they can’t spread the disease to other cats. Managing a household that includes FIV-positive and FIV-negative cats can get complicated. Ideally, the two groups would be completely separated, but if that isn’t possible and they don’t usually fight, giving them separate water and food bowls is about all you can do. There used to be a preventive vaccine for FIV, but it had limited effectiveness and was stopped in 2016. Cats who don’t have any symptoms of their FIV infection can often live for years before they become sick. Some (but not all) of these cats eventually go on to have serious health problems. Research has shown that cats with FIV often enjoy the same lifespan as uninfected cats . If differences are seen, they’re usually relatively small. For example, one study found that on average, FIV-positive cats who weren’t immediately humanely euthanized lived for 4.9 years after diagnosis compared to six years for uninfected cats.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/poisoning/neurological/flea-and-tick-medicine-poisoning-cats,"Flea and Tick Medicine Poisoning in Cats: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","iStock/sdominick It’s important to keep your cat up to date on their flea and tick preventative medication. It’s also important to know that some ingredients most often found in dog flea and tick products are extremely dangerous to cats. This is why it’s never a good idea to give your cat a flea/tick medication formulated for dogs. We’re sharing everything you need to know about flea medicine poisoning in cat. Some pet flea and tick medications—including topical sprays, dips, and shampoos—contain pyrethrin and/or pyrethroid. Pyrethrin and pyrethroid may also be found in insecticidal agricultural products and home products: Pyrethrin is an insecticide derived from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium (“mum”) flowers. Pyrethrins are safe to use in cats if administered at appropriate doses. Pyrethroid is the synthetic version of pyrethrin, designed for enhanced stability and potency. Pyrethroids are not safe to use in cats. The most common pyrethroid is called permethrin, which is found in over-the-counter spot-on products labeled for dogs and is metabolized (broken down) in the liver. Your cat’s liver is not capable of processing permethrin, which causes it to build up, leading to toxicity which is how flea medicine poisoning in cats happens. If your cat’s symptoms are not treated, this toxicity may lead to seizures and death within a few hours. Permethrin toxicity may also occur in dogs, but it is rare and typically only at very high doses. If you suspect your cat is allergic to flea medicine or is experiencing flea medicine poisoning, contact your veterinarian immediately. Flea poisoning symptoms in cats usually occur minutes to hours after exposure to or application of the flea and tick medicine but may be delayed up to 72 hours. The symptoms typically last two to three days. The most common symptoms of flea and tick medicine poisoning in cats may include: Tremors (muscle twitching and/or trembling) Ear twitching Loss of balance or stumbling ( ataxia ) Lethargy Drooling (hypersalivation) Itchiness Hiding Agitation (sensitive to sounds and touch) Vomiting / diarrhea Seizures Possible death if symptoms are left untreated Causes of flea and tick medicine poisoning in cats may include: Accidentally applying dog flea and tick medicine to a cat. A cat brushing against, laying with, or licking a dog that recently had spot-on medicine applied. Such medicines can take up to 24 hours to dry. Sensitivity to appropriately applied/dosed flea and tick products. Overdose of cat’s flea and tick medication. You should always use the correct weight range on the product’s packaging to determine the appropriate dose of flea and tick medication for your cat. Common vet-recommended flea and tick medications for cats that do not contain pyrethrins include: Your veterinarian will ask for a detailed history of any topical medication, shampoo, dip, or spot-on medicine applied to your cat or other pets in your household. If possible, take the product and packaging for the vet to examine. Your vet will start with a thorough physical examination to assess your cat’s neurological status. A complete blood count, serum blood chemistry, and urinalysis will likely be recommended for a baseline evaluation. Unfortunately, there is no specific toxicology test available to determine if your cat was exposed to pyrethrin or pyrethroid. Therefore, the history of exposure to these products is valuable information for your vet. Early detection and treatment are key to your cat’s successful recovery. If your cat is experiencing flea medicine poisoning symptoms, they should be treated as quickly as possible. If you realize you accidentally applied a dog product to your cat, or your cat starts to show symptoms after recent application of a spot-on product to them or to other pets in the household, call your vet immediately for assistance. Depending on the severity of your cat’s symptoms, to prevent further absorption of the product, your vet may instruct you to immediately bathe your cat in diluted dishwashing liquid (such as Dawn) and go to a local emergency veterinary hospital. The emergency vet will assess your cat’s temperature and neurological status. It is likely your cat will be hospitalized for up to three days while undergoing treatment. There is no known antidote for permethrin toxicity in cats, so treatment mainly consists of supportive care to treat the neurological signs listed above. This may involve: IV muscle relaxers IV fluids Anti-nausea medication such as Cerenia (maropitant citrate) and ondansetron Your vet may also recommend a newer treatment called intralipid therapy , which helps pull the permethrin out of cat tissues faster and lessens symptoms. Your cat’s symptoms may last for up to three days, even if you try decontaminating them in diluted dishwashing liquid. Hospitalization is recommended until your cat’s tremors or twitching resolve, and your cat is back to normal. Prognosis is excellent for early and aggressive treatment. However, if your cat’s severe neurological symptoms are untreated or are treated very late, permethrin toxicity in cats can be fatal within a few hours. Typically, cats that recover go on to live normal lives with no secondary consequences. Prevention of flea and tick medicine poisoning in cats (permethrin toxicity) is key when it comes to avoiding an emergency with your cat. It’s critical to remember: Never put a dog flea and tick medication product on a cat Always follow the product recommendations for dosing Ask your vet about flea and tick prevention product recommendations for your cat Separate your cat for 24 hours from any dogs that were treated with a topical product If you have a cat and a dog in one household, ask your vet for a dog flea and tick medicine that does not contain permethrin Keep all flea and tick medication in a safe place away from pets Licking a permethrin-based spot-on flea and tick product for dogs is toxic to cats. If your cat has brushed up against or licked a dog within 24 hours of a spot-on flea and tick medication application, call your vet immediately. If your cat licks a cat-safe flea and tick medication, the bitter taste will typically cause drooling and possibly nausea. Toxicity from your cat’s exposure to permethrin-based spot-on flea and tick products for dogs may last up to three days. Never put a product labeled for a dog on a cat. Cats are not small dogs! Spot-on flea and tick products may take up to 24 hours to dry. It is very important to separate dogs from cats in the household for 24 hours after applying permethrin-based spot-on medicine to dogs. If you apply a cat-safe flea and tick spot-on product to your cat, be sure to do it at the nape of the neck. This should keep the cat from reaching and licking the product.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_hydronephrosis,Fluid Buildup in the Kidney Due to Kidney or Ureter Obstruction in Cats,"PetMD Editorial In most cats, hydronephrosis occurs when fluid builds up in the kidney, causing progressive distention of the renal pelvis (the funnel-like dilated proximal part of the ureter in the kidney) and diverticula (out pouching, with atrophy of the kidney secondary to obstruction). The disease is usually one-sided and occurs secondary to complete or partial obstruction of the kidney or ureter by kidney stones , tumor, retroperitoneal (the anatomical space behind the abdominal cavity), disease, trauma, radiotherapy, and accidental binding of the ureter during spaying and after ectopic ureter surgery. Bilateral hydronephrosis (distention and dilation of the renal pelvis) is rare. When it does occur, it is usually secondary to trigonal (a triangular smooth area at the base of the bladder), prostatic, or urethral disease. This condition is relatively uncommon in cats. Any cause of ureteral obstruction: Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat after taking a thorough medical history from you. You will need to give your veterinarian as much information on your cat's health and recent activities as you can. Standard laboratory tests include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out or confirm other causes of disease. Abdominal x-rays and an ultrasound are important tools for diagnosing hydronephrosis and its underlying cause. Also essential is a transurethral urethrocystoscopy or vaginoscopy, procedures that are performed using a small camera to visualize the inside of the vagina or the urethra (two tubes which drain from the kidneys to the bladder). Your cat will be treated on an inpatient basis and will be started on supportive care (e.g., fluids and antibiotics) while diagnostic testing is performed. Correction of fluid and electrolyte deficits will be undertaken using intravenous fluid therapy over 4–6 hours, followed by maintenance fluids as needed. Some patients may be extremely polyuric (excessive urination), necessitating higher maintenance fluid rates to replace those being excreted. Relieving the lower urinary tract obstruction as soon as possible by catheterization will be a foremost priority, along with serial cystocentesis. Cystostomy is the surgical formation of an opening through the abdomen into the urinary bladder using a tube-like structure. Any obstructions should then be surgically corrected as soon as is possible. Your veterinarian will discuss with you the possible presence and implications of renal disease and the possible need for surgery should it be diagnosed. Specific treatment (usually surgical) depends on the cause of the disease and whether there is concurrent renal failure or other disease process at work (e.g., metastatic cancer). Emergency surgery is rarely required for renal disease. Kidney removal is generally not necessary unless is is infected or cancerous. If mild disease is secondary to the kidney stones, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, which uses shock waves to break up the kidney stones, may be used as an alternative to surgery. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you every 2-4 weeks after the obstruction has been successfully removed in order to monitor your cat's progress. Bloodwork will be taken at these appointments to be sure that the blood urea nitrogen and blood creatinine levels have fallen to normal levels. If you notice that your cat is urinating excessively and/or losing weight after the obstruction has been removed, contact your veterinarian for a further examination. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_pericardial_effusion,Fluid Buildup in the Sac Surrounding the Heart in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pericardial effusion is a condition in which an abnormally large amount of fluid collects in the pericardial sac that surrounds the cat's heart (pericardium). A secondary condition, referred to as cardiac tamponade, results from this retention of fluid, as the swelling of fluid applies pressure on the beating heart, compressing it and restricting its ability to pump blood. The pressure inside the heart increases, and since the right atrium and ventricles normally have the lowest cardiac filling pressures, they are the most affected by cardiac tamponade. With the elevated pressure inside the cat's heart, the heart has a lower cardiac output, leading to right-sided congestive heart failure. Fluid retention throughout the body typically follows ascites, swelling of the limbs, and weakness or collapse. Dogs and cats are both susceptible to pericardial effusion. If you would like to learn more about it affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, in order to rule out underlying systemic diseases like cancer or infection. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Blood tests can help to diagnose disorder that has caused fluid buildup in the pericardial sac. If infection or cancer is the cause of the pericardial effusion, a pericardial fluid analysis can be done to identify the origin of the cancer, or the type of infection. Radiograph and echocardiograph imaging are crucial for correct diagnosis of pericardial effusion. An echocardiograph is even more sensitive than a radiograph for diagnosis of pericardial effusion. An electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical conductance of the heart, sometimes shows a distinct pattern if the cat is suffering from cardiac tamponade. If the cat is diagnosed with cardiac tamponade, immediate pericardiocentesis (drawing the fluid out of the pericardial sac with a needle) is essential; however, this is rarely needed in cats. Cats in respiratory distress will be stabilized with the use of administered oxygen and an oxygen cage. Some animals may need their pericardium surgically removed (pericardiectomy), if there is persistent effusion. If symptoms of pericardial effusion should reoccur in your cat, contact your veterinarian immediately. If your pet has undergone a pericardiectomy, check the surgical incision every day to make sure it is clean, and that it is healing properly. There is always a risk of infection when the skin has been operated on. If there is any itching, swelling, redness, or oozing at the surgical site, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pulmonary_edema,Fluid in the Lungs in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pulmonary edema refers to fluid buildup in the lungs and is often associated with pneumonia, although there are many other possible causes. Normal lungs have fluid that is moved from the lungs into the internal space of the body, an on-going process for normal healthy function. If there is added pressure in the lungs or other underlying conditions, this mechanism can become damaged and fluid can begin to build in the lungs. If this excess fluid is not removed, edema forms. Damage can occur if this condition is left untreated, but when treated appropriately, the outcome is positive. Animals of all ages, genders, and breeds can be diagnosed with pulmonary edema. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Some of the most common symptoms of pulmonary edema are: Pulmonary edema affects both the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Some of the most common causes for pulmonary edema are: Upon examination, the following conditions will need to be ruled out for proper treatment: Typically a blood test will be performed to look for abnormalities, as well as an X-ray to view potential signs of pneumonia. The type of treatment will be dependent upon the severity of the medical condition. Oxygen may be used to help the animal to breathe, while certain fluids may be administered to aid in the flow of fluids within the cat's body. Rest is recommended to assist in the cat's recovery time. Also, diuretics have proven effective at reducing edema, as they work to force excess water and fluids out of the animal's body. This is a condition that has a high recurrence rate, so ongoing management and observation is often recommended and required. Unfortunately, there are currently no known preventive measures for pulmonary edema. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_lymphedema,Fluid Retention and Tissue Swelling Due to Collection of Lymph in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Although it is less common in cats than in dogs , lymphedema is a serious medical condition. It is occurs when localized fluid retention and tissue swelling circulates throughout the lymphatic system. Also known as lymph, this watery fluid typically collects into interstitial spaces, especially subcutaneous fat, as a result of a compromised lymphatic system. The fluid accumulation (edema) is usually not painful and pits; that is, a depression develops if the skin is pushed with a finger (which eventually disappears if fibrosis occurs). Limb swelling, meanwhile, is present at birth or develops in the first several months. The swelling may be affect one or several limbs, and typically begins at the end of the limb and slowly moves upwards. In some cases, lameness and pain may also develop. Hereditary and congenital (present at birth) forms of lymphedema are caused by malformations of the lymphatic system, such as aplasia, valvular incompetence, and lymph node fibrosis. Other potential causes include heart disease, trauma to the lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes, and heat or radiation exposure. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal. The most reliable test used to diagnose this condition, however, is called lymphography. This imaging examination uses a contrast substance, which is injected directly into the lymphatic system, to better visualize the affected region before taking X-rays. Although there is currently no cure available for lymphedema, a number of medical and surgical treatments have been attempted with variable outcomes. Long-term application of pressure wraps and antibiotics to prevent infections may be successful in some patients, while rest and massage seem to not help in treating the condition. There are also various surgical techniques that are used to treat lymphedema, but none have demonstrated consistent results. As there is no cure available, most veterinarians focus on alleviating secondary symptoms and complications such as lameness. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_intussusception,Folding of the Intestines,"PetMD Editorial A change in the shape of the intestine can cause the affected portion of the intestine to slip out of its normal place (prolapse) into an adjoining cavity or duct in the body. Intussusception, the medical term used to describe this condition, can also be used to describe a folded portion of the intestine (invagination), causing that section of the intestinal tract to be blocked. Either of these conditions can result in inflammation of the intestines. While intussusception can occur in animals of all ages, it is more common in younger animals that have weaker immune systems, generally between the ages of one week to nine years of age. In affected animals, around 80 percent are younger than one year of age. Although any breed may be affected, the Siamese breed has been found to have a higher frequency. The exact mechanism behind this medical condition is unknown. This obstruction can be either partial or complete, but the occurrence of an intussusception eventually leads to a mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical signs associated with the intussusception will depend on the anatomic region of the intussusception. If the intussusceptions occur in the gastroesophageal regions -- where the stomach and esophagus are located (gastroesophageal intussusception, or GEI) -- the signs are typically much more severe than if they occur in other regions. In addition, if there is a total obstruction, the cat will have severe complications potentially and symptoms that are more severe. Whether partial or complete, obstruction of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can lead to hypovolemia, dehydration, and compromise of the venous and/or lymphatic systems. Prolonged obstruction can lead to necrosis (death of the tissue) and disruption of the normal capacity of the mucosal barrier that protects the GI tract, allowing bacteria and toxins to be absorbed into the GI tract. Other common symptoms can include: Intussusception high in the intestinal tract Intussusception low in the intestinal tract It can be challenging to isolate the exact cause, as any disease that can alter gastrointestinal motility can lead to an intussusception. Some of the most common causes include: enteritis, recent abdominal surgery, intestinal mural disease, intestinal parasites, a foreign object in the tract, and intense contractions of the bowel portion of the intestine. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Because there are several possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. While some intussusceptions can be chronic in nature, a chronic history of vomiting and/or diarrhea does not necessarily confirm an intussusception. Imaging is often used to properly view the intestines for any possible other causes. This may show an object in the intestinal tract, or a mass of tissue. Your veterinarian may also choose to use a contrasting agent -- a solution that is highlighted in X-ray -- that is either injected or fed to your cat, so that it can be tracked as it progresses through the intestinal tract, allowing your doctor to view any abnormal turns of obstructions. A fecal sample will be taken to check for intestinal parasites, and the electrolyte balances will be checked. In the case of intussusception that are high in the gastrointestinal tract, electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia , hypochloremia, and hyponatremia are not uncommon. Immediate and aggressive intravenous fluid treatment will need to be given if your cat is dehydrated, and your cat's electrolyte imbalances will need to be treated as well. Your veterinarian will initially work on stabilizing your cat and addressing any signs of electrolyte imbalances. A sodium solution may also be given if your cat is found to have hyponatremia. Following any surgical procedure, it is recommended that you limit your cat's daily activity until a complete recovery has taken place. Antibiotics are often administered to reduce the likelihood of a potential infection developing. In the case where a foreign object is found to be causing the obstruction, or a complete block is present, surgery will need to be initiated to correct the issue. If your veterinarian believes the intestinal tissue is ulcerated as a result of the irritation, medications can be prescribed to encourage healing and prevent infection. It is important to maintain fluids following the surgical procedure to prevent dehydration. Most recurrence issues occur within the first several weeks of the animal's surgery, so this is the time for more careful observation. Your doctor will advise you on an appropriate diet for the days following surgery or treatment. Generally, they will be small, easily digestible meals for the first several days, and depending on your cat's recovery, the diet can return to normal once the issue has resolved.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/food-poisoning-cats,Food Poisoning in Cats,"The feline digestive tract is designed to efficiently digest and absorb nutrients from animal proteins. Cats have a highly acidic stomach, which helps them break down their food and can protect them from microorganisms that can cause disease such as bacteria or a virus. Despite this, your feline companion is still at risk for food poisoning. Food poisoning in cats is any illness caused by pathogens in your cat’s food. The most common culprits are E. coli , listeria, and salmonella . E. coli are bacteria that normally live in a healthy cat’s lower intestine. The strains that typically live in your cat’s gut are not harmful. However, other strains cause infection by adhering to cells and releasing toxins. If your cat ingests a harmful E. coli strain, they can experience serious gastrointestinal (GI) problems such as stomach cramps, watery diarrhea , and vomiting . In severe cases, the infection can enter the bloodstream, leading to multi-system problems. Healthy adult cats rarely develop E. coli intestinal infections. However, kittens and immunocompromised cats have a high infection risk. Listeriosis is a bacterial infection found worldwide. The condition is rare in cats but can cause issues such as brain inflammation , systemic infections, and pregnancy complications . Infection can occur through ingestion or inhalation, and infections transmitted through ingestion usually localize in the cat’s intestinal wall, resulting in an ongoing and prolonged shedding of the infectious agent in the feces. Salmonellosis is a highly contagious bacterial disease that is transmitted primarily when a cat consumes contaminated food or water. When a cat ingests a harmful salmonella strain and the pathogen survives the cat’s stomach acid, the bacteria invade the intestinal wall and produce toxins that cause an inflammatory response. Most affected cats exhibit no signs, but GI disease and severe systemic infection can occur. Respiratory problems , eye and brain inflammation, and pregnancy complications have also been reported in cats with salmonellosis. This pathogen is the most likely cause of food poisoning in felines. Food poisoning caused by any of these pathogens is considered a veterinary emergency in cats—it can be fatal if left untreated. In addition, these diseases are zoonotic, which means that you can get it from your cat. Food poisoning signs in cats depend on the pathogen causing the infection. Signs of food poisoning in cats caused by E. coli include: Watery diarrhea with or without blood Vomiting Decreased appetite Lethargy Stomach cramps and abdominal pain Fever Signs of listeriosis in cats include: Vomiting Lethargy Fever Decreased appetite Facial nerve paralysis Head tilt Miscarriage or infertility Signs of salmonellosis in cats include: Diarrhea Vomiting Mucus in feces Abdominal pain Fever Lethargy Decreased appetite Eye inflammation Swollen lymph nodes Abortion or infertility Any cat can contract a pathogen from their food or water. However, kittens and immunocompromised cats have a high infection risk. Cats can get food poisoning from eating the following: Raw pet food Birds or small mammals Garbage Unpasteurized dairy products Raw eggs or meat Spoiled or contaminated pet food If your cat shows signs of food poisoning, they should be examined by a veterinarian. To determine the cause of your cat’s illness signs, your vet may perform any of the following diagnostic tests: History —Your veterinarian will ask questions about your cat’s diet, such as if they eat raw pet food, are allowed to hunt wildlife, or often get into the trash. Physical examination —A thorough physical exam allows your veterinarian to assess your cat’s hydration status and neurologic condition and detect any abdominal abnormalities. Blood work —Blood work, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile, helps evaluate your cat’s overall health. X-rays —Your veterinarian may recommend X-rays to rule out other causes, such as a foreign body obstruction , that may cause similar signs. Fecal culture —Culturing your cat’s feces can identify E. coli and salmonella, and in some cases, listeria. Blood culture —In some cases, a blood culture can determine the pathogen causing sickness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis —If your cat has neurologic listeriosis, your veterinarian may need to analyze their CSF to make a definitive diagnosis. A cat with a mild case of food poisoning can be treated on an outpatient basis, but more severely affected cats are usually hospitalized. Treatments may include: Intravenous fluids —IV or subcutaneous fluids may be necessary to control dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea. Nutritional support —Cats can get extremely sick if they develop hepatic lipidosis , a condition that occurs if they don’t eat for several days. Your veterinarian may place a feeding tube to ensure your feline friend receives adequate nutrition. Antibiotics —E. coli and listeriosis are often treated with antibiotics, but these drugs are only used in life-threatening salmonellosis cases because they can cause prolonged shedding of bacteria in the cat’s feces, which increases the risk of spreading the bacteria to other individuals, including other animals or humans. Pain medications —Pain medications may be needed to control abdominal cramping. Anti-nausea medication —Your veterinarian may also prescribe anti-nausea medications and appetite stimulants. Recovery from food poisoning depends on the severity of your cat’s condition. Cats with severe symptoms will have a prolonged recovery period, and those affected by sepsis—or infection that spreads to the bloodstream—have a poor prognosis for survival. To help your cat recover, follow your veterinarian’s directions and administer all recommended medications. Your cat will also need rechecks to determine their progress and ensure the bacteria are cleared. While your cat is recovering, keep them quarantined from other household pets, and wash your hands thoroughly after handling or cleaning up after them. In addition, your veterinarian may recommend a prescription GI diet or probiotics to help support your cat’s GI tract while they recover. Any cat can contract food poisoning, but you can lower your cat’s risk by: Keeping trash in sealed containers and taking the trash outside when it contains moldy or spoiled food Ensuring any food you offer your cat is thoroughly cooked Checking your cat food labels to ensure the food isn’t expired Refrigerating unused wet food portions in covered containers Never feeding your cat a raw pet food diet or raw treats Paying attention to pet food recalls Not allowing your cat to hunt birds or small mammals Not feeding your cat unpasteurized dairy products Depending on the pathogen your cat contracts, their symptoms usually occur within the following periods: E. coli —Two to five days Listeria —Two days to two months Salmonella —Eight to 72 hours Cats who have food poisoning symptoms should first be immediately evaluated by their veterinarian because their condition can deteriorate rapidly.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_squamous_cell_carcinoma_digit,Foot/Toe Cancer in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cats can be afflicted with several types of skin tumors, even on their feet and toes. One type of tumor that can affect the toes is a squamous cell carcinoma. A squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) can be described as a malignant and particularly invasive tumor that takes hold in the scale like cells of the epithelium – the tissue that covers the body or lines the cavities of the body. These scale like tissue cells are called the squamous. Carcinoma is, by definition, an especially malignant and persistent form of cancer, often returning after is has been excised from the body and metastasizing to other organs and locations on the body. This particular type of carcinoma is a slow moving one, and is typically caught before it has had a chance to spread. However, there is usually a squamous cell carcinoma somewhere else on the skin that spreads to the toes in this case, and more than one toe is usually affected. It may appear as a small nodule, a reddish colored skin plaque, or as a papule – small and blister like in appearance, but differentiated by its lack of fluid. The SCC does not retain its appearance as a solid mass. Over time it will grow, the tissue within the mass will die (necrotize), and the tumor will ulcerate. While this form of cancer can affect any breed of cat, it remains a rare type of foot cancer in cats. Squamous cell carcinomas on the toe typically occur as the result of metastasis of other tumors that have spread from another location on the cat's body. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Be sure to describe any sores that have been apparent on other parts of the body, even if you suspect they were caused by injuries resulting from outdoor activity, or from scratching at the skin. During the examination, your veterinarian will look carefully for other sores or tumors on your cat's body. The lymph nodes will be carefully felt to determine if they are enlarged, an indication that the body is reacting to an infection or invasion. A sample of lymph fluid may be taken to test for cancerous cells. Your veterinarian will order complete blood count and biochemistry profile to make sure your cat's other organs are working normally and to determine whether the white blood cell count is higher than normal; again, an indication that the body is fighting an invasive disease or infection. X-rays images of your cat's chest will allow your veterinarian to visually inspect the lungs for signs of any abnormalities, especially tumors. X-rays of your cat's foot will also be ordered to determine how deep the tumor is in the tissue and whether the tumor on the toe has spread to the bones in the foot. A biopsy will be taken of the tumors so that your doctor can diagnose the specific type of growth it is, whether carcinoma or a benign mass of tissue. If your cat has sores or tumors in other areas, your veterinarian will also order biopsies of these for analysis. Treatment will depend on how many tumors or sores your cat has and whether or not they have spread to other areas of the body. If your cat has only one tumor on one toe, it will most likely be treated with surgery. To be sure that all of the carcinoma is removed, the toe with the tumor will be removed entirely (amputated). Most cats recover well from this type of surgery and are able to walk normally afterwards. If your cat has multiple tumors on its feet, or if there are tumors in other areas as well, surgery may not be a practical option. Your veterinarian will prescribe medication to help minimize your cat's pain, and in some cases, your veterinarian may recommend a veterinary cancer specialist so that you can determine if there are other viable treatment options. If your cat has had surgery to remove a toe, it may limp a little and have some pain in its foot afterwards. Pain medication will help your cat to move through the transition, and its activity may need to be limited until it has completely recovered from the surgery. Otherwise, once it has recovered, your cat should not have any difficulty compensating quickly for the lost digit. If the tumor was limited to one spot and had not metastasized to other parts of the body, a full recovery can be expected. While this type of cancer has a good chance of not recurring, as with any cancer, it is recommended that you take your cat for regular progress checks with your veterinarian.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_esophageal_obstruction,Foreign Objects Stuck In the Esophagus of Cats,"Cats enjoy inspecting the world around them, typically with their mouth, and because of this they often ingest things they shouldn’t. An esophageal obstruction or blockage can occur when a cat ingests a foreign object and that object becomes stuck in their throat instead of passing into the stomach. The esophagus, part of the gastrointestinal system, starts at the back of the mouth and is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Having a foreign object or material stuck in the esophagus can lead to a potentially life-threatening situation. For example, it can cause a tear in the esophagus or lead to an intestinal blockage . While it is more common for a dog to have an esophageal obstruction, it happens in cats too. Having a foreign object stuck in the esophagus (known as an esophageal foreign body) can cause a physical blockage, swelling, and death of the tissue making up the wall of the esophagus. If you notice or suspect that your cat has ingested foreign material or a foreign object, it is considered a medical emergency. Contact your local veterinary hospital immediately. Piece of thread or a sewing needle Hair bands or hair ties Bones Large food material, often without chewing Large dog kibble Table food Rawhides or chew treats Toys—both pet toys and small objects children play with, such as Legos Coins Buttons Yarn Christmas tree decorations (tinsel or small ornaments) An esophageal obstruction occurs with the ingestion of objects that are of a size, shape, or texture that will cause them to get stuck in the esophagus. A partial obstruction occurs when something is stuck in the esophagus but it does not completely block the tube. In this case, food and water can still pass into the stomach and routine digestion can continue. In a partial obstruction, often there are few or no immediate clinical signs, but they develop over time. A full esophageal obstruction occurs when the entire tube is blocked and nothing else can pass. With a full obstruction, if food or water is ingested after the object, the food or water will get stuck, or it will quickly be vomited back up. After ingestion of a foreign body, objects often get stuck in the area where the esophagus narrows in the chest cavity, or where the esophagus meets the diaphragm just before the object should pass into the stomach. Clinical signs depend on the exact location, and if the obstruction is fully or partially blocking the esophagus: Signs of an esophageal obstruction: Drooling Continuous swallowing Difficulty swallowing Extension of the head and neck Gagging Regurgitation Vomiting Decreased or no appetite Depression Inability to settle down, restlessness Trouble breathing Signs of partial obstruction in addition to those above: Weight loss Lethargy Bad smell coming from the mouth Your veterinarian will want a thorough history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You should describe anything you believe your cat might have eaten that could have become lodged in its esophagus. Your veterinarian will do a physical exam and an x-ray of the esophagus and chest. Most objects or materials that your cat ingests are visible on an x-ray. If the object is not visible, it may be necessary to have your cat swallow barium, a liquid that can make it visible on the x-ray. Another diagnostic tool used to diagnose an esophageal obstruction is an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a tiny camera at the end that is passed through the mouth and into the esophagus to locate the problem. Endoscopy requires heavy sedation or general anesthesia to relax the mouth and muscles in the esophagus and ensure that your cat does not bite or damage the camera. Standard blood and urine tests, including a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel, are usually required to make sure it’s safe to use sedation or anesthesia on your cat. These diagnostics can also help to determine if the esophagus has any damage from ingesting the foreign material. Esophageal foreign bodies, once diagnosed, should be removed immediately. An endoscopy procedure can diagnose an obstruction, and can also be used to remove the object with special tools attached to the end of the scope. Forceps, or medical tweezers, can be used at the end of the endoscopy tube to grasp the object or material and remove it through the mouth. If endoscopy is possible to remove the obstruction, it is the preferred method, since it is the least invasive and provides for the quickest recovery. Often, endoscopy is not able to remove the object but can be used to push the obstructive material into the stomach. If surgery is needed to remove a foreign body obstruction, it is safer to remove the object from the stomach than the esophagus. Some foreign materials, such as bones, can be pushed into the stomach, where they can be digested. In that case, surgical removal might not be necessary. Surgery would also be indicated if there is a tear or perforation in the esophagus from the foreign object. Veterinary medical bills are highly variable, depending on the cost of living in your area and where the procedure is being performed. A basic endoscopy to remove the obstruction with no residual effects to the esophagus, including x-rays and anesthesia, can cost $800-$1,500. If, after the endoscopy procedure, it is determined that your cat needs surgery to repair the esophagus or to remove the obstruction from the gastrointestinal tract, the estimated cost would increase to $1,000-$3,000. If the esophagus is torn and your cat requires extensive surgery and medical care, the cost could be $5,000 or more. Recovery time after an esophageal foreign body removal procedure is dependent on the severity of the obstruction—partial or complete, simple or complicated, mouth/stomach or esophagus removal. If your cat has an uncomplicated endoscopy procedure where the obstruction is removed by mouth and no effects are noted in the esophagus, then recovery time is much shorter than if abdominal or thoracic (between the neck and the abdomen) surgery is needed. Your vet will likely provide medications after the procedure to help decrease any inflammation or pain associated with the previous obstruction. If your cat undergoes surgery or if they were not eating prior to or post-procedure, it is typically necessary for them to remain hospitalized until fully recovered. It is recommended that cats eat soft food until the esophagus has completely healed. This can be accomplished by feeding canned food or softening the dry kibble with water. Esophageal stricture formation is the most common complication associated with an esophageal foreign body obstruction. An esophageal stricture is when scar tissue forms along the wall of the esophagus, causing a narrowing of the tube. Sometimes a recheck endoscopy is required one to two weeks after removal of the obstruction to ensure that a stricture is not developing. Other than seeing your cat swallow or ingest something that they should not, these are the symptoms that might indicate an esophageal obstruction. Drooling Continuous swallowing Difficulty swallowing Extension of the head and neck Gagging Regurgitation Vomiting Decreased or lack of appetite Depression Inability to settle down, restlessness Trouble breathing When something is ingested by your cat, it usually takes 12-24 hours to move through the entire digestive tract. Some objects, however, can take much longer—even months! When an object is too big to progress through the digestive tract, it causes an obstruction. An object that causes an obstruction will remain in your cat’s body until it is removed medically or surgically.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_brachial_plexus_avulsion,Front Leg Injury in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cats can experience a forelimb issue after experiencing an injury due to jumping, being in a road accident, a traumatic fall, or after being caught in, or on, something. Prompt medical attention is advised, since the possibility of a spinal cord injury or other severe damage to the body will require that a proper examination and assessment be made. Injuries to the forelimb are sometimes referred to as brachial plexus avulsion. Cats that are experiencing this condition will often exhibit muscular weakness, absence of pain perception, loss of shoulder movement, and the inability to put weight on their paws. The most common causes of foreleg injuries are road accidents, serious falls, or when cats get a foot caught in or on something while jumping or exploring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT) scans may be used to examine your cat's body for internal lesions. Your veterinarian will look for injuries to the spinal cord, or for any associated neurological issues. Treatment will be based on the severity of the injury. Bandaging the foreleg and protecting it from further injury is the most common response. Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly given to decrease swelling, and pain relievers will be prescribed if your cat appears to be suffering. Amputation is sometimes required for injuries that cannot be repaired, or under circumstances where the injury is life threatening. Following treatment, clinical monitoring of your cat is recommended so that improvements to the injured site can be assessed. One of the most common suggestions is to confine and injured cat so that it will not further complicate the injury. An enclosed area, or cage, can be used to encourage your cat to rest and to ensure that the injury heals fully. Protective swaddling, or binding, is also recommended for keeping the limb in place. Physical therapy may be prescribed for regaining muscle strength during rehabilitation, after the initial severity of the injury has passed. It is important to observe your cat's behavior following treatment as there is a potential for infection if your cat rubs its paws repeatedly on the ground. Also, it is important to deter your cat from mutilating itself in an attempt to stop the pain and the associated healing sensations (e.g., itching). In most cases, the injury will resolve within a few months of the initial prognosis and treatment. Because animals can be injured even while doing things that are apparently harmless, and even in the safest homes, there are really no preventative measures for this medical issue. Keeping your cat indoors, or on a leash while out of doors, will go a long way toward prevention of road or environmental accidents. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_fungal_disease_skin,Fungal Disease (Sporotrichosis) of the Skin in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Sporothrix schenckii is a fungus that has the potential to infect the skin, respiratory system, bones and sometimes the brain, causing a diseased state called sporotrichosis. Infection is caused by the virtually ubiquitous dimorphic (mold and yeast) fungus, S. schenckii, which typically infects via direct inoculation - that is, through abrasions of the skin or by inhalation. The origin of the fungus is environmental; it is naturally found in soil, plants and sphagnum moss, but it can be communicated zoonotically between different animal species, and between animals and humans. Cats tend to experience a severe form of cutaneous sporotrichosis, making them an even greater risk for transmitting the infection to other animals and people. In cats, intact male cats that roam outdoors and fight are predisposed to puncture wounds, which then offer an advantageous route for S. schenckii to enter the body. The infection may also be spread by other cats, often through scratches to the skin. Cutaneous sporotrichosis Disseminated sporotrichosis Pulmonary sporotrichosis Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. It is important to note that this is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it is communicable to humans and other animals, and proper precautions will need to be taken to prevent the spread of infection. Even if you do not have a break in your skin, you are not protected against acquiring the disease. An examination of the fluid from the lesions is often necessary to confirm an infection. A negative finding does not always rule out the disease. Laboratory cultures of the deeply affected tissue often require surgery to obtain an adequate sample. These samples will be sent for analysis, along with a special note to the laboratory listing sporotrichosis as a differential diagnosis. Secondary bacterial infections are common. Because of its potential for infection in humans, your cat may be hospitalized for the initial treatment. In many situations, outpatient therapy may be a consideration. Several antifungal drugs are available for treatment of this infection. Your veterinarian will choose the type that is best suited to your cat. The treatment generally takes some time; at least several weeks after the initial treatment before the patient is considered recovered. While your cat is being treated, you will need to protect yourself from infection. Gloves and face masks are suggested, but your veterinarian will instruct you on the best methods for minimizing risk of transmission. Although difficult to prevent because of its prevalence in the environment, it is helpful to determine the source of the Sporothrix schenckii, so that you can take steps to prevent repeat infections. Your veterinarian will set up a schedule of follow-up appointments at around every 2–4 weeks in order to re-evaluate your cat's condition. Clinical signs will be monitored and liver enzymes will be assessed. Side effects associated with treatment will be evaluated, and treatment will be modified according to your cat's reactions. If your cat does not respond to therapy, your veterinarian will make changes in the medication. Image: Stokkete via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_aspergillosis,Fungal Infection (Aspergillosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Aspergillosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by the Aspergillus, a species of common mold found throughout the environment, including dust, straw, grass clippings, and hay. An opportunistic infection occurs when an organism which does not generally cause disease becomes an infectious agent once it has entered into an animals body. In the case of Aspergillosis, it becomes an infectious agent when the body's immune system is weakened from some other disease or illness. There are two types of acquired Aspergillus infection: nasal and disseminated. Both types can affect cats, and while no particular breed is more prone than another, Persians show a slightly higher incidence. There are two types of Aspergillus infections. The first is the nasal form, where the infection is localized in the nasal passages and front sinuses. It is believed that this develops from direct nasal contact with the fungus. For example, if a cat is outside and around dust and grass clippings, the fungus may enter via the moist lining of the nose. The most commonly associated symptoms are nasal discharge and noisy breathing during inhaling. The second type of Aspergillus infection is disseminated, meaning it is more widespread in the body, not only in the nasal area. It is not certain how this form enters the body. Disseminated aspergillosis is most commonly associated with nonspecific signs, such as lethargy, depression, vomiting, and diarrhea. Other symptoms may include protruding eyeballs. The Aspergillus fungus is commonly found in the environment in substances such as dust, hay, and grass. As an opportunistic infection, it is only likely to infect cats with an immune system that is already in a weakened state. Cats exhibiting immunodeficiency -- an inability to produce a normal immune response -- are at higher risk, and cats with illnesses such as diabetes or feline leukemia virus (FeLV) may also be more susceptible to this infection. Diagnostic procedures vary depending on whether the infection is based in the nasal passages or is disseminated through the body. For suspected nasal aspergillosis, analysis of nasal swabs, fungal cultures of nasal discharge, and a rhinoscopy -- inserting a small fiber-optic scope into the nose in order to examine the inside of the nose and its mucus linings -- can be expected. The symptoms for disseminated aspergillosis are mostly nonspecific and therefore more difficult to diagnose. Tests may include a urine analysis and X-rays to examine the spine. There have been successful treatments through the administration of an antifungal drug directly into the nose or further in the nasal passage. If antifungal cat medication is prescribed, you will need to follow the full course of the medication s that symptoms do no recur. Continued treatment depends on the type and severity of aspergillosis. Cats with the nasal version should be monitored for reduced nasal discharge, while those with disseminated disease need to be monitored with urine analysis and X-ray every one to two months. Your veterinarian will recommend a treatment plan to monitor your cat's progress. General good health will help to ensure a strong and healthy immune system so that this opportunistic disease is not a cause for concern. A balanced diet with opportunities for physical activity are essential components of a healthy lifestyle for your cat. Keeping your cat indoors may also be helpful, as it will limit access to grass clippings, hay, straw, and other substances where the Aspergillus fungus grows.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_histoplasmosis,Fungal Infection (Histoplasmosis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Histoplasmosis refers to a fungal infection caused by the Histoplasma capsulatum fungus. It usually enters an animal's intestinal tract after being ingested through contaminated soil or bird droppings. The most common symptoms for cats are lack of appetite, weight loss, and difficulty breathing. Other potential signs may include: The primary cause of this infection is the ingestion of the Histoplasma capsulatum fungus. The fungus may be breathed in when contaminated soil is disturbed, such as when a cat scratches at dirt that it has used for its own waste, or when your cat comes into contact with contaminated bird (including poultry) or bat droppings. Your veterinarian will want to differentiate the symptoms from heart failure, feline asthma, lymphoma, pyothorax, and fungal pneumonia. A chemical blood profile, complete blood count, and a urinalysis will be conducted. Blood tests may confirm the presence of histoplasma antibodies, although this only means that your cat has been exposed, not that it is in a diseased state. Further differential testing will either confirm or rule out the actual state of histoplasmosis. Veterinarians will usually treat this condition with medications on an outpatient basis. If inpatient treatment is recommended, it may be because your cat has been unable to eat and is suffering from malabsorption. If this is the case, your veterinarian will administer drugs, fluids, and nutrients intravenously until your cat's condition has improved. After treatment, your cat's activity level should be reduced until it is fully recovered. Cage rest, or restriction to an enclosed environment will allow your cat to fully recuperate. If the condition does recur, a second course of treatment may be needed. To prevent the development of histoplasmosis, you will need to try to prevent your cat from being exposed to possible sources of contamination, such as where birds, poultry, or bats might roost, or around soil that is known to have bird droppings in it.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_malassezia_dermatitis,Fungal Infection (Malassezia pachydermatis) of the Skin in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Malassezia pachydermatis is a yeast commonly found on the skin and ears of cats. However, an abnormal overgrowth of the yeast can cause dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin. The exact reasons behind this disease are not yet known, but it has been linked to allergy, seborrhea, and possibly congenital (born with) and hormonal factors. Malassezia dermatitis is also less common in cats when compared to cats, but can affect any breed of cat. Cats have both a juvenile and adult form of malassezia dermatitis, both of which can be associated with food and/or flea allergies. In rex cats, genetic features such as predisposition to mast cell abnormality and coat and skin types may be a factor in the onset of the disease. Mature cats with the disease, on the other hand, are often associated with thymomas and carcinomas of the pancreas and liver. Other factors that may be a predisposing factor to malessezia dermatitis include concurrent infections and high humidity and temperature. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count -- the results of which are typically normal unless the cat has a concurrent disease. More specific testing includes a culture of the causative organism as well as taking a small skin tissue sample for a skin cytology test. In this test your veterinarian will touch a sterilized cotton swab to the affected area and stain it with Diff-Quik stain on a glass slide. After staining the glass slide is observed under a microscope to demonstrate the yeast in the sample. This will help him or her identify the causative organism. There are various therapeutic agents used in treating this condition, but the ultimate goal is to reduce the number of yeast and bacteria. Your veterinarian will suggest medications for application on the skin and will also recommend medicated shampoos, which should help remove scales and resolve foul odors. Concurrent bacterial infections will be treated with antibiotics and antibacterial shampoos. You will need to regularly visit your cat’s veterinarian for evaluation of disease and treatment progress. At each visit, your veterinarian will examine your cat and perform a skin cytology test to confirm that the number of causative organism is decreasing. Skin irritation and bad smell usually resolve within one week of treatment; however, recurrence of disease is common when underlying conditions are not resolved. Follow guidelines strictly and apply the topical medications as prescribed. Do not use any shampoo or medication or alter treatment on your cat without consulting your veterinarian. As recurrence is common, watch your cat for any untoward symptoms and call your veterinarian if you suspect a recurrence. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_lower_urinary_tract_infection_fungal,Fungal Infection of Lower Urinary Tract in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Fungi are usually found on the skin of cats and are also prevalent in the outer environment. These organisms are harmless most of the time, or the body is adept at fighting off any ill effects the fungus might have. Fungal infections are uncommon in cats. In some cases, however, some types of fungus may inhabit and infect the lower urinary tract, causing symptoms of infection. The fungus may also appear in the urine after being released from the kidneys. Infection is not apparent in all cases, and may be present for some time before becoming symptomatic. Cats of any age, breed, or gender may be affected. Even when a fungal infection has become well established in the lower urinary tract, there are many cats that display no clinical symptoms. However, in others the following symptoms may be seen: Following are the risk factors which may predispose your cat to a lower urinary tract fungal infection. Frequent access to the outdoors, in combination with any of these factors can increase the risk. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, including a description of the symptoms and the time of onset. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your dog. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count and biochemistry profile are often normal. However, if a fungal infection has spread to other body organs, the abnormalities in these tests will depend on which of the organs is being affected. Urinalysis is important in the diagnosis of this disease as the fungus is often passed into the urine and the laboratory testing may confirm the presence of the fungus in urine. Your veterinarian will also recommend a urine culture test, which will allow for the growing and identification of the causative fungus. Various species of fungi can be identified on the basis of their different growth patterns and characteristics on culture. More specific tests are also available for the identification of the most common species of fungi that cause infections in animals. Your veterinarian will recommend these tests if the fungus that is involved in the infection could not be identified by the culture testing. Fungal infections are uncommon in cats, usually occurring in the presence of other certain risk factors that are known to predispose a cat to fungal infections. Identifying and correcting these risk factors is important for the overall treatment of these infections. Antifungal drugs will be prescribed to eliminate the infection, with the duration of the treatment varying according to the individual animal. A urinary catheter may be used to infuse drugs directly in to the lower urinary tract, with repeat infusions given if required until the cat has completely recovered. In some cats long-term treatment may be required for the complete resolution of clinical symptoms. During treatment, urine samples will again be collected and sent to the laboratory for culture testing. Usually two urine cultures are performed at a 10-14 day interval to see if the fungal infection has resolved or not. The fungal culture will be repeated two months after the cessation of therapy. You’ll need to take care of your cat's diet and also adhere to your veterinarian's recommendations regarding treatment. Monitor the appearance of your cat's urine as much as possible for changes in the color of the fluid, and to note if the cat is having difficulty urinating. If anything appears out of the ordinary, consult your veterinarian so that adjustments to the treatment can be made. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pneumocystosis,Fungal Infection (Pneumocystosis) of the Lung in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pneumocystosis is a respiratory infection involving Pneumocystis carinii , a fungus commonly found in the environment. Although pneumocystosis may lead to a variety of health issues, it only affects dogs (or humans) with compromised immune systems because the weakened body defenses allows the P. carinii organism to multiply and grow to critical levels in the lungs. Generally, the breathing difficulties will progressively worsen over a four-week period. Other signs associated with pneumocystosis include: Pneumocystosis is caused by an overabundance of the P. carinii fungus in the respiratory system, typically found in immune-compromised cats. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are usually non-specific and may show increased number of leukocytes or white blood cells as seen in infections, increased number of eiosinophils, and increased number of red blood cells. Blood gases testing, meanwhile, may reveal decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood ( hypoxemia ), and increased pressure in blood pH. Thoracic X-rays are also conducted to see the severity and stage of the infection, as related to the lungs. For definitive diagnosis, however, your veterinarian will take a respiratory fluid sample or tissue sample to a pathologist to test for abnormal levels of P.carinii . Although it is the most reliable method for verifying pneumocystosis, lung biopsies are not without complications. Moreover, few diagnostic kits are available. Hospitalization and intensive care is required in severe cases. This may include oxygen therapy to minimize respiratory discomfort and prevent further decrease in the blood's oxygen level, and antibiotics to control infection. In these cases, cats are kept in isolation to minimize exposure to other pathogens. Physical therapy may also be used to promote the removal of secretion from the lungs, while intravenous fluids are used to correct dehydration. Prognosis will ultimately depend on the disease that has caused the immunodeficiency. However, it is generally promising in less severely affected patients that have undergone treatment early. Regular monitoring of blood gases, pulse, and thoracic radiography is required to monitor the cat's response to the treatment. In addition, you should restrict the cat's activity level to a minimum and allow it to rest in a cage. If you should notice any signs of a deteriorating condition, such as coughing, respiratory discomfort, etc., call your veterinarian immediately. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_mycotoxicosis_deoxynivalenol,Fungal Toxicosis Related to Fusarium Fungus in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as vomitoxin for its effect on the digestive system, is a mycotoxin produced by the fungus Fusarium graminearum in grains such as corn, wheat, oats, and barley. Mycotoxicosis is the medical term used to describe a diseased state that is brought on by a mycotoxin, a toxic chemical that is produced by a fungal organism, such as molds and yeasts. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol refers to the toxic reaction that results when a cat ingests pet food that was made with DON-contaminated grain. Known symptoms of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol include a sudden refusal of food and/or vomiting after the ingestion of food contaminated by DON. The refusal of food with concurrent vomiting may also lead to subsequent weight loss. Note that if the contaminated food is removed and no longer given, these abnormal signs may resolve and no treatment will be necessary. Studies have shown that vomiting in cats is common if DON concentration in food is greater than eight milligrams per kilogram of food. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol is caused by the ingestion of grains (for example, barley, wheat, corn or oats and other grains commonly used in the production of pet feeds) that are contaminated by the fungus known as Fusarium. This fungus may react in the body in a toxic manner, leading to symptoms such as vomiting, refusal of food, and weight loss . You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Diagnosis of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol can be achieved by analyzing the suspected cat food for the presence of DON. Other diagnostic procedures that may rule out diseases with similar symptoms to those of mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol (namely inappetite and vomiting) include X-rays, chemical blood profile, and urine analysis. Alternate diagnoses may include an infection due to virus, bacteria, or parasite, exposure to various toxins (such as ethanol poisoning), ingestion of poisonous plants (lilies for cats for example), tumors or other abnormal cell growths, or an infection of the pancreas. This condition can generally be solved simply by removing the contaminated cat food, which should result in a quick end of vomiting and a return to normal appetite and food intake. If this is done, no need for further treatment or medications should be necessary. If mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol has been diagnosed, and the problem addressed via removal of the contaminated food, it will still be important for your veterinarian to check your cat's symptoms. Severe vomiting can lead to dehydration for example, in which case body fluids will need to be replenished before any of the internal organs are damaged. If weight has been lost due to vomiting or lack of appetite, your veterinarian will want you to watch your cat carefully, as cats are at particular risk of severe complications when they have gone without food for more than a day. Your cat's weight will also need to be monitored to ensure that expected normal weight gain occurs during the recovery period. This is a preventable disease. Mycotoxicosis-deoxynivalenol can be avoided by feeding only high-quality cat foods that are free of DON. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/fur-mites-in-cats,Fur Mites in Cats,"Fur mites ( Lynx acarus radovskyi ) are parasites that live on cats’ hair shafts. They mainly cause a dull, dry hair coat. Most cats with fur mites are not itchy. Infestations are rare and tend to occur in more tropical regions, such as Hawaii and the Florida Keys. Cat fur mites are not highly contagious. Infection occurs by direct contact with other infected cats or via recently contaminated environments or grooming tools. Fur mites most commonly affect a cat’s hind end. The mites and their eggs may affect your cat’s coat in these ways: Salt-and-pepper appearance Dull coat Dry coat Rust-colored coat Hair that falls out easily The intensity of itching can vary greatly, depending on the severity of your cat’s allergic response. Other, extremely rare, symptoms of fur mites include: Gastrointestinal disturbances Rectal irritation Poor appetite Restlessness Fever Weight loss A diagnosis of fur mites in cats is made by plucking hairs and examining them under a microscope, as the fur mites live attached to the hair shaft Your vet may collect hair samples with adhesive tape for microscopic examination. Most routine flea and tick medications should be effective against fur mites. All pets that have come into contact with an affected cat should be treated. Fur mites are not known to affect humans. The environment may be treated with products approved for flea control. However, that step may not be necessary if your cat will be treated over 6-8 weeks. Routine treatment with flea and tick preventatives should prevent reinfestation.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/gallbladder-and-bile-duct-disease-cats,Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disease in Cats,"The gallbladder and bile duct are two small organs that can cause major problems for cats. If your cat’s gallbladder or bile duct is affected by inflammation, infection, or blockage, they can become seriously ill. The gallbladder is a small organ connected to the liver that stores bile—a yellow-green fluid that is necessary for food digestion in the stomach and intestines. Bile ducts are tiny canals that carry bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine. Conditions that affect the gallbladder and bile duct are more common in cats than in dogs and have no association with a cat’s gender or breed. If left untreated, gallbladder and bile duct diseases can be life-threatening for your feline friend. Common gallbladder and bile duct disorders include: Cholecystitis —Gallbladder inflammation Choledochitis —Common bile duct inflammation Cholangiohepatitis —Acute or chronic inflammation that affects the bile duct, gallbladder, and surrounding liver tissue Acute —Acute cholangiohepatitis causes sudden, obvious illness in cats and is typically seen in young and middle-aged adult felines. Affected cats have an increased risk for gastrointestinal (GI) infections. Chronic —Many cats with chronic cholangiohepatitis have mild or intermittent signs of illness for months or years before they are diagnosed. The condition usually affects middle-aged and senior cats. Cholestasis —Bile duct obstruction that can be caused by tissue swelling, inflammation, or scar tissue compressing the bile duct. Gallstones are rare in cats, but if present, they can also block the bile duct. Acute cholangiohepatitis signs are usually severe and sudden, and include: Fever Abdominal pain Jaundice (i.e., yellow tinge to mucous membranes and white part of the eyes) Lethargy Vomiting Decreased appetite Chronic cholangiohepatitis signs are typically vague and intermittent, and include: Vomiting Diarrhea Appetite fluctuations Jaundice Weight loss Cholestasis signs can vary depending on the underlying cause, and may include: Lethargy Decreased appetite or excessive hunger Vomiting Jaundice Weight loss Dark urine Pale-colored feces Abnormal bleeding Cholecystitis, choledochitis, and cholangiohepatitis can be caused by numerous issues. These disorders may develop because of any of the following problems: Impaired bile flow caused by gallbladder muscle malfunction Inadequate blood flow to the gallbladder Irritants in the bile Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Trauma to the abdomen Bacterial infection Gas in the gallbladder wall, especially in cats who have diabetes Parasites Abnormal gallbladder development An immune-mediated disorder Cholestasis affects the bile duct, and its causes can include any of the following: Pancreatitis Intestinal inflammation Cholecystitis, choledochitis, or cholangiohepatitis Intestinal obstruction Parasites Gallstones Tumors Diagnosing gallbladder and bile duct disease in cats can be difficult. To do so, your vet may need to perform extensive diagnostics such as: History —Your veterinarian will ask for a detailed medical history, including the signs your cat has shown, the length of time they have experienced problems, pre-existing medical conditions, prior surgeries, and potential trauma. Physical exam —Your veterinarian will be able to detect abnormalities, such as jaundice and abdominal pain, during a thorough physical exam. Complete blood count (CBC)—A CBC is a blood test that can detect abnormalities, such as anemia or an elevated white blood cell count, which may be present with gallbladder and bile duct disease. Biochemistry profile —Cats affected by gallbladder and bile duct disease typically have elevated liver values, which can be assessed through a biochemistry profile. Thyroid levels — Hyperthyroidism , or high thyroid hormone levels, can lead to elevated liver enzymes. Your veterinarian may test your cat’s thyroid levels to rule out this condition. Pancreatic function tests —Pancreatitis can cause or exacerbate gallbladder and bile duct disease, so evaluating your cat’s pancreatic function may be recommended. X-rays —Abdominal X-rays may reveal abnormalities but are often normal in affected cats. Ultrasound —Ultrasound is a good way to image your cat’s liver, gallbladder, and pancreas and to detect signs of inflammation through changes in organ appearance and blood flow. Fine-needle aspirate —Your veterinarian may take a bile sample from your cat using an ultrasound to guide the needle during the collection process. Exploratory surgery —In some cases, exploratory surgery is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. Treatment depends on your cat’s signs, disease severity, and the underlying cause. Initial treatment involves supportive care such as intravenous fluids and feeding tube placement. Cats who stop eating often develop hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver syndrome , a life-threatening condition. Providing nutritional support as soon as possible is important. Other treatments may include antibiotics, corticosteroids, and medication to improve bile flow. Surgery may be necessary if a bile duct obstruction is present. If your cat’s signs are mild, outpatient care may be appropriate, but cats experiencing significant issues will be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring. When diagnosed and treated in the early stages, cats with acute cholangiohepatitis have a good prognosis for recovery. While those affected by chronic cholangiohepatitis can’t be cured, they can experience long-term remission. The prognosis is not as good for cats in advanced disease stages. Some cats may require long-term treatment, including medications to protect their liver, vitamin supplementation, and a prescription diet . Cats affected by cholestasis typically have a good prognosis if the obstruction’s underlying cause is treated and bile can flow normally through the duct. However, if cancer is present, the prognosis for recovery is poor. Preventing gallbladder and bile duct disease in cats is not possible. However, keeping your cat at a healthy weight and feeding them a nutritionally balanced diet for their life stage may reduce their risk. About 40% of cats survive for one to five years after treatment, and about 10% live beyond five years.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_gastric_stasis,Gastritis in Cats,"Gastritis is defined as inflammation of the stomach lining. Gastritis in cats can be either acute (short and immediate or less than one week in duration) or chronic (lasting longer than one to two weeks). Acute gastritis is typically a presumptive diagnosis, and the underlying cause often goes undiagnosed because symptoms resolve with either minimal treatment, or no treatment. Chronic gastritis signs can vary in frequency and type and are characterized by inflammatory cells determined through a biopsy by a veterinarian. Gastritis can develop in any breed, age, or sex of cat. Younger cats are more likely to ingest inappropriate items or different foods, so they are more prone to developing acute gastritis. Acute gastritis often is self-limiting or responds to mild therapy. Chronic gastritis can be very serious or even fatal in some cases. Symptoms of gastritis in cats may include: Vomiting (with or without blood) Decreased/absent appetite Abdominal pain Lethargy Dehydration Melena (dark tarry stool) Diarrhea and/or weight loss Gastritis can be a primary or secondary condition. This means it can occur on its own or be secondary to other systemic diseases, such as liver disease, kidney disease , diabetes mellitus , or neurologic disease. The most common cause of acute gastritis in cats is dietary indiscretion (ingesting food or other items that are novel and cause inflammation of the stomach lining). Acute gastritis can also be caused by: Medication reactions Toxin ingestion, including plants, spoiled or toxic foods, antifreeze, and cleaning agents Infections (bacterial, viral, or parasitic) Overeating Stress Ingestion of foreign objects Chronic gastritis can be caused by: Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) Chronic foreign objects in the stomach causing partial blockage of outflow Tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (benign or cancerous) Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Stomach ulcers Other systemic illnesses (such as liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, or neurologic disease) A thorough history—including any known dietary indiscretion, toxin ingestion, other illnesses, or stressful situations—and physical examination should be performed by your veterinarian when gastritis is suspected. Diagnostic testing becomes more aggressive as clinical signs become more prominent and based on the findings of other less-invasive tests. Diagnostic tests your veterinarian may perform include: Bloodwork : A complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry profile with electrolytes helps to assess hydration status and any underlying systemic disease. Urinalysis : Testing of your cat’s urine helps to assess kidney function and bladder health. Fecal testing : Your cat’s feces will be analyzed to diagnose any intestinal parasites that may be causing gastritis. Abdominal radiographs : Radiographs help to find any masses, fluid in the abdomen, foreign objects, and/or blockage of the gastrointestinal tract. Contrast radiographs : These are used when an abdominal ultrasound is not an option. A contrast agent is introduced into the gastrointestinal tract and monitored via a series of X-rays to see how it is emptied from the body. This test can illuminate masses, blockages, and/or motility issues in the gastrointestinal tract. Abdominal ultrasound : Ultrasound can help assess all the organs of the abdomen for any possible disease. This modality is more specific when trying to assess intestinal wall layering and thickness—and for possible obstructions. Biopsy of the gastrointestinal tract : A biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose the cause of underlying inflammation. Your vet may recommend an upper gastrointestinal endoscopic partial thickness biopsy or a full thickness surgical biopsy. Surgery or endoscopy can often be used to help remove foreign objects from the gastrointestinal tract—if these are the cause of gastritis. Treatment of gastritis depends on the specific cause and the severity of clinical signs. Many cases of acute gastritis are self-limiting, meaning they can be resolved without therapy. Nonmedical therapy for gastritis includes withholding any food for 8 to 12 hours after the last vomiting episode to allow the stomach to settle. Typically, small amounts of water are offered over the first 12 to 24 hours, followed by about 8 to 12 hours of no food and small amounts of a bland diet (which is easy to digest and low in fat) several times throughout the day. It is recommended to gradually increase the amount of food over one to two days, then slowly transition back to the original diet over a period of three to five days to avoid further belly upset. If vomiting restarts, or if your cat continues to vomit during nonmedical therapy, you’ll need to schedule a veterinary visit. If your cat cannot keep water down and continues to vomit only when drinking, contact your veterinarian immediately. Medical therapy for gastritis in cats includes: Anti-vomiting medications, such as Cerenia, Ondansetron , or Dolesetron Pro-motility agents (unless a foreign-object blockage is suspected), such as Metoclopramide Acid-reducers, such as Pantoprazole, Famotidine, or Ranitidine Fluid therapy (either subcutaneous for mild dehydration or intravenous for moderate-to- severe dehydration) Cases of chronic gastritis caused by chronic inflammation (IBD or cancers) may benefit from chronic steroid usage, chemotherapeutic agents, and/or immunosuppressive medications. Your veterinarian will help formulate a plan with you based on your cat’s diagnosis and your long-term goals. Most cats with acute gastritis will improve on their own with no medical intervention. Other cases of more severe acute gastritis will require medical therapy, with a good prognosis dependent on the underlying cause. Certain blockages or toxins can be fatal if untreated. For example, antifreeze ingestion is deadly if not diagnosed and treated within a few hours of ingestion. The prognosis for chronic gastritis also depends on the underlying cause. Often, changes to a novel protein diet (a new protein never before introduced to the pet) or hydrolyzed protein diet and probiotic therapy is recommended for the duration of the cat’s life. Stress should be kept to a minimum in the household. Sources of stress as well as holistic or medical therapies can be determined by your veterinarian. Frequent vet visits (every one to three months) are recommended for cats on immunosuppressive medications, including steroids and chemotherapy. Blood testing and a routine schedule of abdominal imaging may be required. Acute gastritis can recur if your cat continues to ingest anything inappropriate, so it is important to eliminate those items—such as strings, toxins, and plants—and avoid abrupt diet changes. Unfortunately, even in the face of treatment, flare-ups are common in cats with chronic gastritis. Yes, and they often do. It can be serious if symptoms persist or worsen, or if signs are intermittent or recurrent. Gastritis in cats can be fatal if secondary to a toxin ingestion; an obstruction/blockage in the stomach or intestines; or cancer. Yes, stress can cause inflammation of the cat’s stomach lining, but usually urinary tract signs are more common with stress in cats than are gastrointestinal signs.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/gastroenteritis-cats-types-symptoms-and-more,"Gastroenteritis in Cats: Types, Symptoms, and More","urbancow/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images It’s distressing when your cat becomes ill and experiences digestive upset with symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms are collectively called gastroenteritis and can be a sign of a serious condition. Gastroenteritis is inflammation and irritation of the stomach and intestines. Gastroenteritis in cats can be triggered by a variety of causes, including a cat eating something they shouldn’t have , parasites , infection, and body-wide (systemic) conditions such as liver, kidney, or thyroid disease. Gastroenteritis is commonly characterized by vomiting and diarrhea , which can cause your cat to become dehydrated and develop electrolyte imbalances. These issues require immediate veterinary care, especially if your cat’s symptoms are severe. Additionally, vomiting and diarrhea disturb the healthy balance of beneficial bacteria in your cat’s digestive tract. Gastroenteritis is typically a medical emergency in kittens, elderly cats, and cats with other medical conditions. Left untreated, gastroenteritis can potentially result in severe dehydration and other secondary medical conditions, which can be life-threatening. If you are concerned that your cat has gastroenteritis, schedule an appointment with your vet. In most cases, gastroenteritis will not ease without veterinary care. Symptoms of gastroenteritis in cats include: Vomiting Diarrhea Nausea (often characterized by licking or smacking the lips or drooling ) Decreased appetite or loss of appetite ( anorexia ) Low energy ( lethargy ) Weakness Fever Weight loss Kittens, elderly cats, outdoor cats, unvaccinated cats , and cats who are not on monthly year-round parasite prevention are more likely to develop gastroenteritis due to parasites, infections, toxin exposure, or dietary indiscretion. Cats who have concurrent medical issues are also at higher risk for developing gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis in cats can have several causes, including: Internal parasites, such as intestinal worms or protozoa Dietary indiscretion (eating something that upsets your kitty’s digestive tract, including non-food items or new foods or treats ) Bacterial infection Viral infection (such as FIV , FeLV , FIP , panleukopenia virus ) Fungal infection Food sensitivity Contaminated raw diets Poisoning or exposure to a toxin , such as human over-the-counter or prescription medications, human food or drinks, veterinary products, plants, household products , or insecticides Adverse reaction to a medication Inflammatory conditions, such as an allergic reaction , inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or an autoimmune disease Internal diseases, such as diabetes or conditions involving the liver , gallbladder , kidneys , or thyroid Gastrointestinal disease, such as ulcers , pancreatitis , or pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) Cancer To diagnose gastroenteritis, your vet will start by reviewing your cat’s full medical history and performing a comprehensive physical examination . They may also perform diagnostic tests, such as: Fecal tests to screen for parasites and infections Blood work Urinalysis X-rays If your kitty has chronic (long-term) gastroenteritis or if they are not improving with treatment, your vet might advise further testing, such as an abdominal ultrasound and/or endoscopy, which involves examining the digestive system with a camera attached to a long, flexible tube. During this procedure, which is performed under general anesthesia , your vet may take tissue samples . Treatment for gastroenteritis in cats depends on the underlying cause. Cats with mild symptoms of gastroenteritis generally do well with outpatient treatment or staying in the hospital for the day. Kittens and cats who are more severely affected may need to be hospitalized for a few days for more advanced care. To treat your cat’s gastroenteritis, your vet may prescribe: Electrolyte and fluid therapy, including subcutaneous fluids (fluids given under the skin) or intravenous fluids (fluids given through an intravenous catheter while your cat is in the hospital), to correct and prevent further dehydration Anti-nausea medication ( Cerenia ), given by injection or by mouth Most cats with mild gastroenteritis recover in a few days with treatment. Cats who are severely ill may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and may have a longer recovery at home after discharge. Gastroenteritis in cats can’t always be prevented, but here are five ways you can help reduce your cat’s gastroenteritis risk: Schedule regular wellness visits with your veterinarian: Keep your kitty up to date on vaccinations and lab work. Fecal screening tests are needed twice a year for indoor cats and four times a year for kittens and newly adopted cats. Partner with your vet to choose a healthy diet for your kitty: Feed a diet containing a nutritional statement from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) to ensure the diet is complete and balanced for kittens or adult cats. Talk to your vet before changing your kitty’s diet or treats. Avoid raw diets. A study has shown that raw diets can pose health risks to pets due to bacterial and viral contamination . Avoid feeding people food to your cat. Administer a monthly all-in-one parasite preventive (e.g., Revolution Plus) year-round for life: Speak with your vet to determine which preventive is best for your cat. Prevent your kitty from hunting and ingesting wildlife: Keep your cat indoors with only leashed, supervised outdoor visits to prevent them from ingesting rodents and other wildlife. This also reduces their exposure to parasites and infectious diseases. Cat-proof your home: Cats are naturally curious, which can get them in trouble. Check house plants to ensure they are not poisonous to cats. Inspect cat toys often, and discard toys with rips, holes, or loose pieces. Keep small chewable items, medications, supplements, and cleaning supplies out of reach. Put locking lids on cabinets and trash cans. Gastroenteritis can last for 24 hours or longer, depending on the cause and severity of your kitty’s symptoms. Cats with mild symptoms may take a few days to recover. Cats who are more severely affected may need to be hospitalized for intensive care, and after they are discharged, they may need several days of treatment and recovery at home. Indoor cats can develop gastroenteritis from eating something that upsets their digestive tract, an infection (e.g., parasites, bacteria, viruses), accidental exposure to household toxins (e.g., medications, plants, human food, cleaners), inflammatory conditions, or systemic diseases. Your cat’s gastroenteritis treatment will depend on the underlying cause, your cat’s symptoms, and how sick and dehydrated your cat is. Potential gastroenteritis treatments your veterinarian may prescribe include fluid therapy, a gastrointestinal diet, antibiotics, and medications to block nausea, prevent diarrhea and/or vomiting, stimulate their appetite, or treat parasites.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_polymyositis_dermatomyositis,Generalized Inflammatory Muscle Diseases in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Polymositis and dermatomyositis are both generalized disorders which involve the inflammation of the cat's muscles. More specifically, polymyositis involves skeletal muscle damage due to inflammation, but with no pus formation, whereas dermatomyositis is a form of polymyositis in which characteristic skin lesions are also seen. These disorders are rarely seen in cats and are more common in dogs . You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and tests to evaluate levels of creatine kinase enzyme -- normally found in the brain, muscles, and other tissues -- to assess muscular damage. He or she will also collect a sample of the muscle to send to a veterinary pathologist for further evaluation. This is the single most important test for diagnosing polymyositis. In cats with regurgitation, thoracic X-rays will help evaluate the esophagus for dilatation or identify tumor(s) within the esophagus. Surgery may be required if tumor(s) are found. Corticosteroids are typically used to suppress overactive active immune system, which may be an underlying factor. In addition, antibiotics are prescribed to fight off infection. Long-term corticosteroids treatment may be required in cats with severe immune-mediate diseases. As muscle inflammation decreases, you will need to increase your pet's activity level to improve muscle strength. Cats with an enlarged esophagus (megaesophagus) will require special feeding techniques. You will briefed about elevating feeding and adding various foods to the cat's diet, especially foods of different consistencies. In cases of severe regurgitation, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube into the cat's stomach to ensure proper nutrition. He or she will also show you how to use the feeding tube correctly, and will assist in setting up a feeding schedule. In addition, good supportive care is required to prevent skin wounds and ulcers in non-emergency patients. Fortunately, cats with polymositis and dermatomyositis due to immune-mediated causes have a good prognosis. If cancer is the underlying cause of the diseases, however, prognosis is poor.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_malignant_fibrous_histiocytoma,Giant Cell Tumors in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Histiocytes are white blood cells that reside within the connective tissue of the body. Referred to as tissue macrophages, histiocytes play a defensive role in the body’s immune response, engulfing cellular debris and infectious agents, as well as initiating defense mechanisms in the system. The term histiocytoma refers to a tumor containing an excessive number of histiocytes. Generally, histiocytomas are benign growths, but there are documented cases of malignant fibrous histiocytomas, where the tumor is composed of both histiocytes and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are the most common cells found in the body’s connective tissue, playing a major role in wound healing. This condition involves the cells of both, with the addition of giant multinucleated cells, which occur as the result of the immune system cells attacking infectious agent cells and fusing together. This category of giant cell histiocytoma is found mainly in cats, although it can occur in any animal breed. The most common symptoms include: The causes for malignant fibrous histiocytoma are currently being studied. Upon examination, your veterinarian will need to rule out a variety of other medical issues prior to issuing a diagnosis and treatment plan. Other medical conditions that can cause giant cell tumors to form include: Your veterinarian will take a sample of the suspect tissue for biopsy so that the exact composition of the tumor can be ascertained. A histological examination, along with x-ray imaging, will define the course of treatment. Chemotherapy can be helpful if the tumor is large, or if the cancerous cells have moved into other areas of the body (metastasized). In most cases, the highest chance for success will be in prompt and aggressive surgical removal of the tumor. Unfortunately, depending on the location, amputation may be necessary in cases where a limb is being adversely affected. If chemotherapy is administered, there may be a variety of side effects. Consulting with your veterinarian regularly will enable you to better observe your cat for progress and make your cat as comfortable as possible. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_giardiasis,Giardia in Cats,"Giardia is a single-celled organism classified as a protozoan. It can live in the intestines of cats (and other animals, including dogs and humans) and cause severe gastrointestinal disease. It is spread by fecal-contaminated water, food, or soil. Giardia is found worldwide and in every part of the United States. Giardia is primarily a disease that causes a lot of severe, watery diarrhea . Giardia in cats can also cause: Vomiting Excess gas Decreased appetite Decreased energy Frequent trips to the litter box You will probably notice an irritated perianal region and excessive grooming to keep clean, which is unfortunately a source of continual reinfection. It is also worth noting that cats (and other animals) can have the protozoa present in their intestines and still not show any symptoms. It is not known how often this is the case, as Giardia is not routinely tested for in cats unless they have diarrhea. Giardia is a protozoan that must be orally ingested. Cats are infected by the cysts by ingesting stool or contaminated soil (via grooming) or drinking contaminated water. Contaminated food is less often a source of Giardia for indoor cats but can be a source of infection for outdoors cats. Your veterinarian will gather a complete history and conduct a physical exam to evaluate your cat’s hydration status and check for intestinal pain. A quick test for Giardia is available through your veterinarian’s office. They will likely need to do a fecal test for other intestinal parasites . Medications for the eradication of Giardia are readily available and affordable. Metronidazole , an antibiotic, is most often prescribed. Additional medications may be prescribed depending upon the severity of the infection and the cat’s condition. The disease can take multiple rounds of treatment, as cats may continually reinfect themselves through frequent grooming (ingesting cysts on their fur) and other sources of environmental contamination. Because cats that have been treated have no “immunity” against future infection, they can easily be reinfected. Therefore, all living areas that the cats have access to should be disinfected. Ammonia, dilute bleach solution, or steam cleaning can be effective. It is the impracticality of disinfecting entire households that makes this parasite a tough one to eliminate. If there are other pets in your household, medications may be administered to them as a preventive measure. Contaminated soil or areas can remain infective for months under the right conditions, so avoiding those areas when at all possible is advisable. Multiple negative tests are necessary to ensure the disease has passed, as cysts are not always shed and detected on the test. And when bringing a new pet home, it is always encouraged to have an exam and stool check for parasites as well as Giardia testing before bringing the pet home and around other animals. No, Giardia is a protozoal infectious agent that will not resolve on its own. Oral medications are the recommended treatment, and Giardia does not “run its course,” as a common cold does. With the appropriate medication and dosage, most cases of Giardia in cats are not hard to clear, though they do require consistent treatment, strict compliance in decontaminating the home environment, and retesting to ensure the parasite is eradicated. Giardia will last until it is treated and eradicated. The environment must also be decontaminated or the pet can become reinfected. Yes, Giardia is passed in the stool of infected cats. The life cycle is fecal-oral, which means another cat would have to ingest the cysts from the environment. Keep in mind that cats are fastidious groomers, so you can imagine how the disease is spread easily. Yes. Giardia can cause diarrhea and disease in humans. If your cat is diagnosed with Giardiasis , environmental disinfection is important for your own health and safety, as well as preventing recurrence in your cat and any other pets. Yes. Cramping and diarrhea are as painful for cats as they are for humans. If untreated, Giardia can be fatal, especially in kittens. Its dehydrating effects can be quite severe. Cats can have painful cramping and diarrhea as well as dehydration and other symptoms if Giardia is not treated. In kittens or smaller cats, Giardia can cause death from dehydration.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/gingivitis-in-cats,Gingivitis in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Gingivitis is considered the earliest stage of periodontal disease , and more than 80% of pets 3 years or older develop some form of periodontal disease. However, gingivitis is reversible with proper care. Here’s what you need to know about gingivitis in cats and how you can protect your cat’s dental health. Gingivitis is inflammation of the gingiva , or gums. In the early phases of gingivitis, some plaque is present on teeth and there is a mild redness of the gums, but the gingival surfaces are smooth. Plaque is the result of food, debris, bacteria, dead cells, and mucus that collects on the teeth. Plaque forms within 24 hours on clean tooth surfaces, which is why frequent teeth brushing is so important. The gums respond to plaque with swelling, collagen loss, and inflammation. In advanced gingivitis, cats will have moderate-to-severe redness of their gums, irregular gum surfaces, and plaque and calculus (tartar) under their gums and on their tooth surfaces. Calculus forms when calcium in saliva mixes with plaque, making it hard and difficult to remove. The gingival sulcus , or gum pocket, is the narrow space between the inner wall of the gum and the tooth. As gingivitis develops, the bacteria present in these pockets irritate the gums and release toxins that destroy the gum tissue. Some signs of cat gingivitis include: Red or swollen gums , especially on the side of the gums facing the inner cheeks Halitosis /bad breath Variable amounts of plaque and calculus on the surface of the teeth Plaque and tartar accumulation is the main cause of gingivitis in both cats and dogs. Here are some predisposing factors that can lead to gingivitis in cats: Old age Crowded teeth Soft food Abnormal chewing habits Not receiving oral health care (no dental cleanings, teeth brushing , etc.) Uremia and diabetes mellitus Autoimmune diseases FeLV (Feline Leukemia Virus) FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, considering the history of symptoms and possible conditions that might have led to gingivitis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and the onset of symptoms, such as: When the bad breath began What your cat typically eats Whether your cat has had trouble eating/chewing Whether your cat has had any previous health conditions What routines you follow to keep your cat's teeth clean (if any) Which cat dental products you use Part of the physical involves examining your cat's mouth, but your veterinarian may recommend that you make an appointment for a thorough dental exam, which can only be performed under anesthesia and is often combined with a dental cleaning . Treatment for cat gingivitis involves removing plaque and tartar from all surfaces of a cat’s teeth (including under the gums) and dealing with any predisposing factors and gum damage that may have occurred. Your veterinarian will check the depth of the gum pockets. They may need to pull any teeth that are infected, severely damaged, or too crowded. Your veterinarian may also recommend X-rays of the teeth to determine if the gingivitis has progressed to periodontal disease and to look for infection at the tooth root. The tooth surfaces will be polished, and the teeth will be reexamined after cleaning. Other treatments may be necessary based on the condition of your cat’s teeth and gums. Your veterinarian will teach you how to help keep your cat’s teeth clean home, and you should make appointments for follow-up examinations. The frequency of dental exams and cleanings will depend on the stage of periodontal disease your cat is diagnosed with. They may be scheduled once a year, or more frequently if your cat has reached a more severe stage of disease. You can help maintain your cat's oral health care by brushing or rubbing their teeth with a special finger pad using a veterinary toothpaste . It’s best to brush your cat’s teeth every day (at least every other day). Anything less and plaque and tartar can quickly redevelop, causing gingivitis in your cat. Your veterinarian may also give you a veterinary antibacterial solution to squirt on your cat's teeth or to add to your cat’s drinking water to decrease plaque buildup. There may be some cat dental care products that can help you maintain your cat’s dental health as well. Good options are listed below. Talk to your veterinarian about what is appropriate for your cat. Featured Image: iStock.com/FaST_9 Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_glaucoma,Glaucoma in Cats,"Glaucoma is a condition where there is an increase in the fluid, called aqueous humor, inside the eye. Aqueous Humor: Aqueous humor is the fluid that gives eyes their round shape and provides nutrients to the structures inside the eye. There is a balance between enough fluid to support the eye and too much fluid, which can create high pressure inside the eye and damage it due to lack of drainage. Intraocular Pressure: Increased pressure inside the eye, called intraocular pressure (IOP), can cause irreversible blindness if not treated quickly. Glaucoma is caused by increased IOP due to lack of aqueous humor drainage. There are two types of glaucoma in cats: This is caused by an abnormal aqueous humor drainage ability due to an anatomical abnormality. It is a genetic predisposition that is generally seen in dogs and not commonly in cats. This is caused by a secondary disease that creates a physical barrier to aqueous humor drainage. This barrier may be created by white or red blood cells, cancer cells, an eye lens that is out of place (lens luxation), or an overgrowth of tissue covering the drainage angle due to a chronic eye inflammation called anterior uveitis. Cats that develop glaucoma may have Glaucoma is painful, and your cat may act different than normal due to pain. This can look like Since glaucoma is mainly secondary to other diseases, cats may have signs of illness in other parts of their body which may include: Secondary causes include: Your veterinarian can easily diagnose cat glaucoma with an eye test called tonometry, which measures pressure inside the eye, or intraocular pressure (IOP). Normal IOP in cats is 15-25 mmHg. Any IOP above normal is considered glaucoma. Sustained elevations in IOP will cause blindness due to damage to the optic nerve and retina. In emergency situations where the pressure inside the eye is very high and blindness may occur, your veterinarian may administer: Once intraocular pressure is normalized, your veterinarian may conduct other tests to determine the underlying cause, including bloodwork and additional eye tests. If no underlying cause for the glaucoma can be found with extensive testing, the intraocular pressure cannot be well controlled and the eye is blind, or the cause is eye cancer, then surgical removal of the eye, called an enucleation, is generally recommended. Uncontrolled glaucoma is painful, and removing the eye provides significant pain relief for your cat. It is also curative for cases of primary eye cancer and can provide a diagnosis of the underlying cause for glaucoma in cats where one could not otherwise be found. Treatment cost for glaucoma in cats depends on the underlying cause and whether it presents as an emergency that needs emergency treatment as described above. Cats with glaucoma either need lifelong treatment of glaucoma to maintain eyesight and prevent pain, or they may need surgical removal of the eye, as well as treatment for the underlying cause. Due to various underlying medical conditions that can cause glaucoma in cats, the long-term prognosis is difficult to generalize. In cases of infectious diseases or trauma, if the infection or injury can be cured, then the eye may recover. In cases caused by cancer, if the cancer is only in the eye, surgery to remove the eye is curative. In cases where the cancer is metastatic (in other parts of the body) or with non-curable infections like FeLV or FIV, your veterinarian will prescribe daily medication. Regardless of the cause, once blindness has occurred, it will not improve unless there is early intervention with either surgery or medication. Most cats will go on to live relatively normal lives especially in cases where only one eye is removed. Yes, depending on the underlying cause. If the underlying cause can be identified and is treatable, then your cat can either get eye drops to control the glaucoma or may need surgery to remove the affected eye. If you suspect that your cat has glaucoma, you should take them to your veterinarian or an emergency veterinary hospital as soon as possible for testing and treatment. Untreated glaucoma will cause irreversible blindness in the affected eye. There may also be other side effects, depending on the reason that the glaucoma has developed. Yes, glaucoma is very painful. People with glaucoma describe the pain of increased intraocular pressure like a constant migraine headache. Eye drops to reduce intraocular pressure relieve this pain.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_glomerulonephritis,Glomerulonephritis in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The term glomerulonephritis refers to the inflammation and subsequent dysfunction of the glomeruli -- the small mass of capillaries in the kidney that filters waste products from the blood and into the urine so they can be secreted from the body. The most common cause of glomerulonephritis is the deposition and entrapment of antigen-antibody complexes (such as a toxin or enzyme) within the glomeruli. Moreoever, the disease affects both genders, but occurs in more often in males. Symptoms may vary depending on the underlying cause, like inflammation, infection, or neoplasia. In some cats, the only presenting symptom may be weight loss and weakness. In fact, many times, the condition is discovered incidental to a routine annual health screening, when increased concentrations of proteins are found in the urine. If the protein loss into the urine is severe, the cat may develop an abnormal collection of fluid in the abdominal cavity ( ascites ). In cats suffering from advanced disease with kidney failure, there may be symptoms of increased thirst and frequency of urination, lack of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Those with a severe deficiency of the blood protein albumin ( hypoalbuminemia ), may suffer from a blockage of the lung's blood vessels, which causes respiratory difficulties or severe panting. High blood pressure, meanwhile, may cause sudden blindness. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of the complete blood count test are usually not significant. In severe cases, the biochemistry profile may reveal abnormally low levels of blood protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia) and high levels of cholesterol in the blood (hypercholesterolemia). The presence of blood protein albumin and other proteins in the blood may help your veterinarian in making the initial diagnosis. In cats with kidney failure, the urinalysis will reveal corresponding changes in urine. Creatinine is a waste product normally excreted by the kidneys, and its presence in the urine is measured as a diagnostic indicator of kidney function. Urine protein testing is also performed, as the amount of protein found in the urine can also be used to evaluate and monitor kidney function. A more specific test calculates the urine protein and creatinine ratio in order to give your veterinarian an idea of the degree of kidney damage. The extent of protein loss in the urine roughly correlates with the severity of the kidney disease. Therefore, measuring protein and creatinine ratio also helps in assessing treatment response and progression or regression of disease. Diagnostic imaging can also be used for determining how diseased your cat's condition is, and what treatment needs to be applied. These procedures are helpful in the diagnosis of concurrent diseases and in evaluating the kidney size. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound can be used to evaluate the kidneys and other abdominal organs, and can be helpful in performing a less invasive type of tissue collection for biopsy purposes. Your veterinarian may take a kidney tissue sample (kidney biopsy) to rule other causes of kidney failure, such as neoplasia or cancer. As most cases of glomerulonephritis involve an immune reaction (interaction of antigen and antibodies), the most specific and effective therapy is the control and elimination of such an immune reaction. However, finding and treating the exact disease process or antigen that is causing such an immune reactions is not always possible. Moreover, once renal failure has developed, the prognosis is often poor. The overall treatment of this disease depends on the cause and severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Your veterinarian will recommend an individualized diet plan for your cat that is tailored toward kidney health. These patients often require low sodium and high quality, low quantity, protein diets. Because most drugs are eliminated through the kidneys, do not give your cat any types of drugs, or change the dosage of any prescribed drugs without consulting your veterinarian beforehand. In follow-up visits, your veterinarian will need to conduct regular laboratory testing in order to monitor the therapy response and progression of the disease, adjusting medications and therapies as necessary.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_glucosuria,Glucose in the Urine in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Normally, the kidneys are able to reclaim all of the filtered glucose from the urine into the bloodstream. Glucosuria (or glycosuria) is characterized by the presence of glucose into the urine. It is nearly always due to kidney disorders, such as diabetes mellitus. Glucosuria is categorized as hyperglycemic (260–310 mg/dL ) or normoglycemic, and subcategorized as transient or persistent. Symptoms will depend on the underlying disease, but some possible signs include: Hyperglycemic glucosuria Normoglycemic glucosuria You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, electrolyte panel, and urinalysis to detect any underlying systemic diseases causing the glucosuria -- though often there is too little glucose present in the cat's urine to be detected. Hexokinase- or glucose dehydrogenase-based techniques are recommended for quantification of urinary glucose. The type of treatment will depend on the underlying cause of glucosuria. If a urinary tract infection is present, for example, antibiotics will be employed and adjusted according to the culture. Meanwhile, solutions or medications that may have caused the glucose to appear in the urine should be discontinued immediately. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_glycogen_storage_disease,Glycogen Storage Disease in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Glycogen storage disease, also known as glycogenosis, is a rare inherited disorder with various types, all characterized by deficient or defective activity of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing glycogen in the body. This leads to an abnormal accumulation of glycogen, the main carbohydrate storage material in the body which aids short term energy storage in cells by converting to glucose as the body needs it for metabolic requirements. Accumulation of glycogen in the tissues can result in the enlargement and dysfunction of various organs, including the liver, heart, and kidneys. The Type IV classification found in cats is seen in the Norwegian Forest breed. Signs may manifest at five to seven months of age, or in some cases, the disease may manifest in the womb, resulting in a still birth. In cats, type IV glycogen storage disease is apparent in Norwegian Forest cats, and often results in death before birth. If your cat survives this condition, symptoms can include fever, muscle tremors, and weakness. The various forms of glycogenoses all result from some sort of deficiency in glucose-metabolizing enzymes in the body. The types are distinguished by the specific enzyme deficiency. Type IV, the type found in cats, results from a deficiency of the glycogen branching enzyme. Diagnostic procedures will vary depending on the symptoms and suspected type of glycogen storage disease at hand. A tissue enzyme analysis and determination of glycogen levels can serve as a definitive diagnosis. Other tests may include urine analysis, genetic testing, and electrocardiography (ECG) to check the electrical output from the heart for changes. Care will vary depending on the type of glycogen storage disease diagnosed and the severity of symptoms. Hypoglycemia may need to be regulated with diet, feeding frequent portions of a high-carbohydrate diet. Upon diagnosis, your cat will need to be continuously monitored and treated, if necessary, for hypoglycemia. However, there is not much that can be done. Glycogenosis is fatal for most animals, or they are euthanized due to progressive physical deterioration. Because this is an inherited disease, animals that develop glycogen storage disease should not be bred, nor should their parents breed again, in order to avoid the possibility of future cases.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/gum-disease-in-cats,Gum Disease in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Gum disease, or periodontal disease, is a dental condition in cats. It causes inflammation of some or all the affected tooth’s supporting structures. Gum disease is one of the most common illnesses in cats. If food particles and bacteria are allowed to accumulate along a cat's gumline, it can form plaque, which—when combined with saliva and minerals—will transform into calculus (tartar). This causes gum irritation, or a reddening of the gums around a cat’s teeth. This inflammatory condition is called gingivitis . This is an early stage of periodontal disease in cats. After an extended period, tartar builds up under a cat’s gums and separates it from the teeth. Spaces will form under the teeth, fostering bacterial growth. Once this happens, a cat has irreversible periodontal disease. This usually leads to bone loss, tissue destruction, and infection in the cavities between the gum and teeth. Periodontal disease in cats is classified in four stages based upon how the mouth looks during oral examination and in dental X-rays. All stages of dental disease in cats can cause the gums to bleed. Your cat’s medical treatment will be chosen based on this staging by your vet. Gingivitis —This stage occurs when there is inflammation of the gingiva, or soft tissues of a cat’s mouth, without attachment loss. Gingivitis does not affect the firm structures (bone). Early periodontitis —Up to 25% attachment loss of the ligament that holds the tooth in a cat’s gums Moderate periodontitis —25% to 50% attachment loss Advanced periodontitis —More than 50% attachment loss Tooth resorption —Destruction of crown and tooth roots, holes in teeth, and intense pain Health Tools Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps. Symptoms of gingivitis in cats include: Red, swollen gums Bad breath (halitosis) Plaque on the teeth Varying degrees of tarter buildup Painful mouth, which may present as a cat pawing or rubbing their mouth/face Drooling Dropping food Bleeding gums Only eating soft food Turning head excessively while eating Symptoms of periodontitis in cats include all the above, plus: Loose teeth Tooth loss Decreased appetite or anorexia Gum recession Exposed tooth roots Teeth chattering Tooth resorption Cat periodontal disease can be caused by several factors, though it’s most caused by a bacterial infection. Bacteria under the gumline leads to pain and inflammation of the tissue. This bacteria accumulation below a cat’s gumline is often partly due to lack of oral care, such as routine teeth brushing. Lack of routine dental cleanings with your vet can also cause gum disease in cats. There may also be a relationship between having a history of calicivirus infection and severe gingivitis. Other conditions that may contribute to gum disease in cats include: Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Severe kidney disease Diabetes mellitus Autoimmune disease Your veterinarian will look inside your cat’s mouth for red, inflamed gums. Your vet may press gently on your cat’s gums to see if they bleed easily, which is a sign that a deep dental cleaning—or more—is needed. If your vet notices any of these signs of gingivitis or gum disease, they will likely recommend that your cat have a dental procedure. Your veterinarian will run some blood work. They will also check your cat’s heart and lungs to ensure it’s safe to put them under anesthesia for the procedure. Once under anesthesia, the diagnosis of cat periodontal disease involves several procedures. If periodontal probing reveals more than one millimeter of distance between the gingivitis-affected gum and tooth, a cat is considered to have some form of periodontal abnormality. X-rays are important in diagnosing periodontal disease in cats, as up to 60% of symptoms are hidden beneath the gumline. In the disease's early stages, X-rays will reveal loss of density of the tooth which is presented as a dark area instead of bright white. In more advanced stages, it will reveal loss of bone support around the root of the affected tooth. The specific treatment for periodontal disease in cats depends on how advanced a cat’s condition is. In early stages of gum disease in cats, treatment is focused on controlling plaque and preventing the loss of a cat's tooth. This is achieved through daily brushing with pet-safe toothpaste and vet-prescribed products to minimize the development of plaque. Your vet may recommend that the affected tooth is removed. To remove the tooth, your cat will have to go under anesthesia. Blood work and chest X-rays are done before anesthesia to ensure your cat’s safety. Before the procedure, your cat will have to be fasted at least 12 hours to ensure an empty stomach for the procedure to reduce changes of complications such as vomiting and aspiration pneumonia . Once the affected teeth are removed—in conjunction with oral medications like antibiotics—the gum disease should be resolved. Follow-up treatment for periodontal disease in cats consists mostly of maintaining good cat dental care and taking your cat for weekly, quarterly, or biannual checks. Depending on how fast tarter builds up in your cat’s mouth, dental procedures are recommended every six to 12 months. Ask your vet if they can perform dental cleanings in-clinic. If they can’t, ask where they recommend. Avoid non-aesthetic dental cleanings, as they are not recommended. Ensure that the vet performing the cleaning has the capability to perform dental X-rays. Dental cleaning procedures for cats often range from $300 to $2,500, depending on the severity of a cat’s gum disease. Recovery from a dental procedure often requires your cat to wear a recovery collar to prevent them from being able to paw or scratch at the mouth. Some cats also need to eat canned food or even a special dental diet after the procedure to aide in their recovery. Often antibiotics and/or pain medication are part of the recovery plan. Your cat’s prognosis will depend on how advanced their gum disease is. The best way to minimize the adverse effects caused by the disease is to get an early diagnosis, adequate treatment, and proper therapy. The best prevention for gum disease in cats is to maintain your pet’s good oral hygiene. Regularly brush and clean their mouth and gums, at least three times per week, every other day. If trained slowly over time, cats will allow their teeth to be brushed. Training a cat to enjoy their teeth being brushed starts early in kittenhood and should become routine. You can offer your cat a dental treat before and after teeth brushing to ensure that they enjoy the process. Prescription cat food dental diets are available for those cats who are unwilling to have their teeth brushed. Cat dental treats, water additives and other products certified by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) are also shown to help reduce plaque and calculus. Gum disease in cats can be entirely preventable with routine care both at home and with your veterinarian. This can be a very painful condition and can cause further illness if not treated. If you have questions or concerns about your cats teeth, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian or consider chatting with a veterinary professional at Chewy’s Connect with a Vet . Cats can live a long, healthy life with gum disease if they are monitored frequently by their veterinarian. Ensuring that routine dental cleanings are done as well as preventative care, gum disease is manageable or even curable depending on the underlying cause. Dental disease itself is not fatal—but the consequences of this condition can be. Dental disease can cause pain which may prompt your cat to stop eating. Cats that don’t get adequate nutrition will start to develop liver failure within about 72 hours of not eating. This occurs from the body using the fat around the liver for energy. Liver failure can be fatal if not treated promptly and aggressively. Depending on how much liver damage is present, it might not be reversible.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_hair_follicle_tumors,Hair Follicle Tumors in Cats,"PetMD Editorial There are two types of hair follicle tumors, which arise from cystic hair follicles (follicles that have closed over, like a sac), and, which arise from the cells that produce the hair follicles. Hair follicle tumors are generally benign tumors that originate in the hair follicles in the skin. Trichoepitheliomas are small benign tumors, often found along a cat's back, shoulders, flank, tail or limbs. Pilomatricomas are rare skin tumors that develop from the hair matrix, where the cells which grow the hair follicles develop and are contained. Hair follicle tumors should be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian. The prognosis for these hair follicle tumors is generally positive, as the majority of the tumors are found to be benign. Amongst breeds, Persian cats appear to have a predisposition to hair follicle tumors. Trichoepitheliomas Pilomatricomas You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. Samples of the tumor will need to be taken for a close examination of the structure of the tumor. Samples will be taken for histopathologic laboratory analysis, both by fine needle aspirate (fluid sample) and by tissue biopsy. Such an analysis will determine exactly which type of hair follicle tumor is present and whether it is benign or malignant. Although this type of tumor is often found to be benign, it is possible that your veterinarian will find that it is a tumor of a different kind. Your veterinarian will most likely recommend excising the tumor, leaving wide surgical margins to ensure that the tumor has been removed entirely. If the histopathological results show a malignant tumor, your doctor may need to refer you to a veterinary oncologist for further treatment. It is important to monitor your cat for recurrence of the hair follicle tumors. If you notice that your cat is developing more of these tumors, contact your veterinarian. Overall, the prognosis for this medical condition is generally excellent, as the majority of tumors are found to be benign. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_chemodectoma,Heart and Carotid Artery Tumors in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Aortic and carotid body tumors, classified as chemodectomas, are generally benign tumors that grow from the chemoreceptor tissue of the body. These are the tissues most sensitive to chemical changes in the body, such as oxygen content and pH levels in the blood. While chemoreceptor tissues can be located throughout the body, chemodectomas mainly affect the chemoreceptor organs: the aorta and the carotid organs (i.e., heart and carotid artery). Chemodectomas are rare in cats, but when they do occur, older cats tend to be more predisposed. However, there does not appear to be a gender or breed predilection for chemodectomas. Given that this is a rare condition in cats, aortic tumors are more common than carotid tumors, but metastasis to other organs appears to be more common in cats when it does occur. Aortic body tumors occur on the aortic artery near the base of the heart. They are rarely of a malignant nature; they will grow within the space but not spread to the surrounding organs. These tumors become a health concern when their growth displaces the trachea, when they grow into the adjacent vessels, or when their growth places pressure on the atria or vena cava, impairing their functionality for conveying blood to the body and heart. Symptoms associated with aortic body tumors include: Carotid body tumors, meanwhile, occur on the common carotid artery near the point of bifurcation -- where the artery splits into the internal and external carotid arteries. These arteries carry oxygenated blood to the head and neck, and are located in the neck. Because of this relation to the major arterial passages, carotid body tumors are often impossible to remove. In the majority of cases, these tumors remain slow growing but benign, and as with aortic tumors, they become a health issue when they invade the spaces of the adjacent blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. In an estimated 30 percent of cases, metastasis may occur into the surrounding organs, such as the lungs, bronchia or lymph nodes, or further into the liver or pancreas. Symptoms associated with carotid body tumors include: Other symptoms seen in cats affected by either body tumor type include: It is suspected that chronic lack of oxygen ( hypoxemia ) may be associated with chemodectoma development. After performing a thorough physical exam on your cat and taking a complete medical history from you, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, complete blood count, urinalysis, and electrolyte panel. The results of these tests will give some indication of the whether the cancer has spread in the body. If hemorrhaging is occurring, anemia may be present, and if metastasis is taking place, higher than normal liver enzymes may be present in the bloodstream. Chest X-rays will be used to identify the location of the mass and to check for cancer spread to the lungs or spine. A heart ultrasound will also be performed, and if heart impairment is suspected, an electrocardiogram (EKG) may be used to measure the heart’s ability to conduct electrical signals. If possible, a tissue sample will be taken from the mass for biopsy. This will provide a definite diagnosis. Unfortunately, the prognosis for cats with either of these types of tumors is grim. It is often very difficult to remove these tumors because of their placement, and they will continue to grow until functioning of the surrounding vessels or organs is impaired to the point of cardiac arrest or organ failure. Cancer treating therapies, such as radiotherapy, can sometimes be used along with surgery to slow down the spread of these cancers. Your cat will need to be reevaluated by your veterinarian at least every three months for chest X-rays, as well as a physical exam to monitor for recurrence or spread of the cancer.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_endomyocardial_diseases,Heart and Lung Diseases in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Endomyocarditis, or inflammation of the inner heart muscle and lining, is an acute heart and lung (cardiopulmonary) disease that typically develops following a stressful event. It is characterized by interstitial pneumonia , and inflammation of the innermost portion of the heart. Pneumonia is usually severe and commonly results in death. Endomyocarditis occurs predominantly in males, between the ages of 1 and 4 years. The development of biventricular endocardial fibroelastosis (occuring within both heart chambers) or left heart failure , meanwhile, occurs prior to 6 months of age. Endocardial fibroelastosis is an inherited (congenital) heart disease in which severe fibrous thickening of the muscular tissues within the heart leads to heart failure. Moderator bands are normal muscular bands in the right lower chamber (ventricle) of the heart that can sometimes occur in the left lower chamber. Excessive moderator bands (EMBs) is a rare and unique pathologic disease. EMBs can be seen at any age. Endomyocarditis Endocardial Fibroelastosis and EMB Generally, the causes for endocardial fibroelastosis or endomyocarditis are uknown. Risk factors for endomyocarditis include stressful incidents, such as anesthesia (commonly associated with neutering or declawing), vaccination, relocation, or bathing. Endocardial fibroelastosis, meanwhile, may be due to genetic factors; it is often seen in Burmese and Siamese cats.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_aortic_stenosis,Heart (Aortic) Valve Narrowing in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The narrowing of the aortic valve, which controls the blood flow from the left ventricle (one of the cat's four heart chambers) to the aorta ventricular outflow tract, is a congenital (present at birth) defect called aortic stenosis. It is a serious health concern that may lead to various complications. There are three types of three types of aortic stenosis: valvular (present at the valve), subvalvular (present below the valve), or supravalvular (present above the valve). The defect typically develops over the first few weeks to months of life; however, symptoms may appear at any age, depending on the severity of obstruction. Some of the more common symptoms include: In most cases, cats are born with the this heart defect. However, some develop the aortic obstruction due to bacterial endocarditis . You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, often revealing abnormal heart sounds (murmurs), an indication of irregular heart valve function. However, murmurs are are not always a sign of disease, especially in young animals, as they may occur due to pain, fever, or excitement. Your veterinarian will correlate the findings with other symptoms to determine if the murmur is abnormal. The veterinarian may also conduct several laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, though the results are usually normal. Chest X-rays, meanwhile, may reveal an enlarged heart, especially on the left side of the organ. And in cats with congestive heart failure, abnormalities may be detected in the lungs. For a more detailed evaluation of the heart and related structures, the veterinarian may use echocardiography, which may reveal thickening of the left ventricle wall and aortic valve. In some cats, echocardiography may reveal a dilated aorta due to stenosis, resulting in abnormal blood flow. The treatment and management guidelines are controversial and vary among experts. However, most agree the aim of therapy is to treat the complications related to the defect. To truly “cure” the cat, open heart surgery is required to repair (valvuloplasty) or replace the valve. However, the prognosis of cats that undergo surgery is not favorable, and therefore not usually attempted. Catherization may also be used to widen the narrowed vessels, but the procedure does not demonstrate survival advantages for cats with severe forms of the disease. Typically, broad spectrum antibiotics are given to cats with aortic stenosis due to the increased risk of developing bacterial infections in the heart. The overall goal for you and the veterinarian is to minimize the cat's symptoms, prevent complications, and improve its quality of life. Activity should be immediately restricted to prevent complications (sometimes fatal) due to overexertion. Low sodium diets will also be recommended for cats with congestive heart failure. Affected animals shouldn’t allow breeding or preferably neutered. You’ll need to closely watch your cat at home for abnormal signs and inform the veterinarian immediately if and when they occur. Cats with mild forms of aortic stenosis may live a “normal” lifespan without any treatment. However, those with severe forms of the defect have a poor prognosis, even with treatment. Regardless of the severity, many veterinarians will recommend against breeding an animal with this heart defect. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/heart-attacks-cats,Heart Attacks in Cats,"iStock/Vasyl Dolmatov Heart attacks, also referred to as myocardial infarctions, are very rare in cats. As with humans, heart attacks occur in cats when a large blood clot blocks blood flow to the heart. This can lead to changes in breathing and heart rate, weakness , and collapse . Heart attacks can cause discomfort and pain to cats and are generally caused by an underlying heart condition, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , or other systemic illnesses, such as hyperthyroidism . Heart attacks most commonly happen in cats with pre-existing heart disease . They have a higher risk for blood clots because of the changes in the shape and function of their hearts. Parts of the heart can become enlarged or thickened and less efficient at pumping blood, which means that more blood collects in the heart chambers, which can form clots. Heart attacks are often fatal, and cats showing signs of this condition should be brought to a veterinarian immediately. Because heart attacks in cats are rare, there’s not much research available about survival rates, but cats in serious condition when seen by the veterinarian may not survive. Many symptoms of a heart attack in cats are nonspecific and can be caused by a variety of conditions. Taking your cat to a veterinarian for the right diagnosis is important if you notice any abnormal behaviors or symptoms. Symptoms of heart attacks in cats may include: Difficulty breathing Panting Changes in heart rate Lethargy Changes in behavior, such as hiding or vocalizing Collapse Blood clots in the heart that cause a heart attack may also break off and travel down the aorta (main artery) to cause a blockage in a condition known as saddle thrombus. This can lead to back leg weakness, paralysis , or legs that feel cold to the touch, in addition to the symptoms listed above. Heart attacks in cats are caused by underlying diseases. Possible causes include: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common heart condition in cats. It causes major changes to the walls of the heart and can lead to blood clots, since blood is not pumped through the heart very well. Ragdolls and Maine Coon cats have a higher risk of this condition because of their genetics. Hyperthyroidism is common in senior cats; it causes hypertension (high blood pressure) and can lead to heart disease, both of which can increase the risk of a heart attack. Endocarditis is inflammation (swelling) of a cat’s heart lining from infection, which can result in blood clots forming within the heart and other blood vessels. Heartworm disease causes major damage to the heart and lungs, increasing the risk for blood clots. Indoor cats are still at risk, since mosquitoes can easily enter homes and spread the disease if the cat is bitten . Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a rare condition in cats that results in abnormal blood clot formation. It’s usually caused by another underlying disease, such as lymphoma . Since heart attacks are medical emergencies, veterinarians will at first work quickly to stabilize the patient and provide life-saving treatment. Pet parents should let their veterinarians know when symptoms started, if their cat is taking any medications, and if their cat has been previously diagnosed with a medical condition. Once the cat is stabilized, the veterinarian will try to determine the underlying cause of the heart attack. A thorough physical exam is done to find abnormalities. Testing may include: Blood work —A small sample of blood is collected to check for signs of infection, inflammation, clotting abnormalities, or internal diseases. X-rays —Pictures of the chest and abdomen may be taken to check for heart enlargement, fluid in the abdomen or lungs, or changes to blood vessels. Echocardiography —A heart echo is a specialized test that uses sound waves to make detailed pictures of the heart. It’s used to diagnose underlying heart disease. For cats in very poor condition when arriving at the veterinary hospital or who die at home, a postmortem examination is needed to get the right diagnosis. Because a cat having a heart attack is an emergency, treatment is mostly supportive at first. Oxygen therapy, intravenous (IV) fluids, anti-clotting medications, antibiotics, and pain management may be started. After stabilizing, the main treatment goal is to get rid of the blood clot, which can be done using medications or surgery depending on the location and severity of a cat’s condition. A cat’s chance of recovery is usually not good, even with treatment, because of the seriousness of a heart attack. Cats who do recover will be sent home on medications specific to the underlying disease. For example, cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may receive beta blockers and ACE inhibitors (medications that decrease blood pressure and treat arrythmias). A veterinarian will prescribe medications that are right for each cat. Recovery from a heart attack depends on the underlying cause, how quickly treatment is started, and the cat’s overall condition. Supportive care may help a cat having a heart attack if it is diagnosed early. However, heart attacks in cats are often fatal. Cats that do survive often will have lasting damage to their hearts. This may result in exercise intolerance, weakness, and a failure to thrive. Cats who have recovered from a heart attack should be kept in low-stress situations to not make extra work for their hearts. Keeping them separated from other household cats, or dogs if they do not get along, and keeping a consistent routine at home is helpful. Pet parents should bring their cats to all veterinary follow-ups during their recoveries. Keeping your cat healthy with regular preventative veterinary care is important to catch diseases that can cause heart attacks. During routine wellness visits, veterinarians can run blood work to check for signs of inflammation, infection, and metabolic diseases, such as hyperthyroidism. They are also able to complete a physical exam and listen to your cat’s heart and lungs to find issues that call for more testing or treatment. Cats should be kept current on heartworm preventatives , such as Bravecto® Plus , year-round to prevent heartworm disease that can damage the heart and lungs. The prognosis for cats with heart disease depends on how early diagnosis and treatment occurred. Cats who are diagnosed and receive treatment early have a much better outcome (months to years) than cats who receive no early intervention.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrial_fibrillation_atrial_flutter,Heart Beat Problems (Fibrillation and Flutter) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are called the atria (single: atrium) whereas the bottom chambers are called the ventricles. Valves are provided between each atrial and ventricular pair, each on the left and right side. The valve between the right atrium and right ventricle is called the tricuspid valve, where the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle is called the mitral valve. The heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern. In both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter this rhythm is disturbed and synchronization is lost between the atria and ventricles. Both conditions refer to a rhythm problem that originates in the upper chambers of the heart, that is, the atria. Atrial flutter is often a precursor to atrial fibrillation. In atrial flutter there is a premature electrical impulse that arises in the atria, resulting in a faster than normal heart rate, either regular or irregular in frequency, whereas in atrial fibrillation there is quivering type of contraction of the heart muscles, resulting in a rapid and abnormally paced heart rhythm, also referred to as arrhythmia. In atrial fibrillation the atria beat chaotically, resulting in irregular rhythms of the ventricle as well. On an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures the electrical activity of the heart, a distinct pattern can be differentiated in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Older male cats have been found to be more susceptible to this condition. Atrial fibrillation is categorized by relevance, including: The symptoms generally relate to an underlying disease like congestive heart failure (CHF). Following are few of the symptoms related to atrial fibrillation. After taking a detailed history of your cat’s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination. Laboratory tests will include complete blood tests, a biochemical profile, and urinalysis. It is possible that the results of these tests may not reveal much information related to this disease, but they may be helpful for accessing an overall picture of your cat’s health and reveal other diseases, if present. Additional diagnostic tools include echocardiography (ECG), X-ray imaging, and color Doppler to help in characterizing the type and severity of any underlying heart disease. Your veterinarian will first diagnose the level of flutter or fibrillation your cat is experiencing, and whether there is an underlying disease of the heart, such as CHF, that is responsible for the atrial arrhythmia. If the heart is beating too rapidly, your cat will be treated medically for the rhythm to be slowed down. If no underlying disease is found to be present, the treatment will be directed towards normalizing the rhythm of heart and getting the sinoatrial node back into sync with the atrioventricular node (AV) node. If the fibrillation is a chronic problem (more than four months), the success rate drops accordingly. Electrical shock therapy may be used to normalize the rhythm is some cases. If an underlying cardiac disease like CHF is present, the treatment will also be directed towards its treatment, along with stabilizing the heart rhythm. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines regarding diet, exercise, rest, medication, and management of your cat at home. In cases of primary atrial fibrillation, recurrence can occur, especially in patients with chronic problems. Observe your cat’s health and call your veterinarian if you notice any symptoms that appear abnormal. In cases of severe cardiac diseases like CHF, a high level of commitment and care will be required on your part for the treatment and management of your cat’s home care. Keeping a diary of all events and staying in touch with your veterinarian throughout treatment period will help you to follow your cat’s progress. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrial_premature_complexes,Heart Beat Problems (Premature Complexes) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Under normal circumstances, the heart works with exceptional synchronization between the various atrial and ventricular structures, resulting in a consistent rhythmic pattern. Atrial premature complexes result in an abnormal rhythmic disturbance, where the heart beats prematurely, before the normal timing, or pacing. Excluding animals born with a congenital heart disease, atrial premature complexes often affect older cats. Atrial premature complexes (APCs) can be seen on an electrocardiogram (EKG) as a premature wave called a P wave. This P wave may be biphasic, negative, positive or superimposed on the previous T wave on the EKG. There are four chambers in the heart. The two top chambers are the atria (single: atrium), and two bottom chambers are the ventricles. The P wave on an EKG represents the electrical conduction from the sinoatrial node in the heart to and through the atria of the heart. The QRS complex -- a recording of a single heartbeat on the EKG -- following the P wave represents the passing of this impulse through the heart’s ventricles after it passes through the atrioventricular node. The last wave on an EKG reading is the T wave which measures ventricular recovery (from charging) before the next cardiac contraction. An increase in automaticity of atrial heart muscle fibers or a single reentrant circuit can cause a premature P wave to occur. These premature atrial beats begin outside of the sinoatrial node (ectopic) -- the pacemaker of the heart -- and disrupt the normal ""sinus"" heart beat rhythm for one or more beats. Although there may be no symptoms associated with atrial premature complexes, especially in older cats or in cats that are normally not very active, some common signs include: You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The full physical exam will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count and an electrolyte panel. It is crucial to search for an underlying cause for the heart disease that is bringing about the APCs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Other diagnostic tools, like echocardiograph and Doppler ultrasound, can be used to visualize the heart and its performance (rhythms, velocity of contraction). The treatment your veterinarian administers will depend on exactly what kind of heart disease is affecting your cat and how severe it is. There are several different types of medicines that can be used, depending on the type of heart disease present. A drug to dilate the blood vessels (vasodilator) may be prescribed for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and digitoxin may be prescribed to decrease the heart rate and increase cardiac contractility in cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. Underlying cardiac diseases must be treated and kept as controlled as possible by your veterinarian. This means that you will need to take your cat to the veterinarian for frequent follow-up appointments. Sometimes, despite drug therapy, some animals will have an increased frequency of APCs, or will deteriorate to more severe signs of heart disease as the underlying disease progresses. Depending on the underlying cardiac disease, you may need to change your cat's diet to a low sodium diet. Your veterinarian will advise you on the diet and amount of activity your cat will need to be of optimum health. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrial_standstill,Heart Beat Problems (Standstill) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial If ECG (electrocardiogram) findings identify missing P-waves in the cat's atria, it is probably suffering from a rare heart rhythm disturbance called atrial standstill. A measure of the electrical activity of the atria (the top two chambers in the cat's heart), P-waves that are absent may be an indicator of a more serious underlying disease. Atrial standstill can be temporary, persistent, or terminal due to complications such as heart failure. Along with absent P-waves, the ECG of the cat may demonstrate a slow heart rate with regular or irregular rhythm. Although routine laboratory tests, including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, are conducted on the animal, often atrial standstill is confirmed through ECG (electrocardiogram) findings. Other common findings include abnormally high levels of potassium and sodium in the blood -- both of which are only found with a biochemistry profile. These results may also indicate abnormalities related to other concurrent diseases. Echocardiography, meanwhile, will help your veterinarian diagnose the type of heart disease and the severity of the issue. In some cats, atrial standstill is not a life-threatening condition and no hospitalization is required. However, in others it may be serious enough to require immediate intensive care. Such animals typically have an abnormally high blood potassium level or are suffering from severe dehydration. In these cases, intravenous fluid therapy is used to stabilize the animal. If the cat's heart rhythm cannot be rectified by ordinary means, a pacemaker may be surgically implanted into the chest or abdomen. This small medical device helps control the abnormal heart atria activity. The prognosis of the cat depends on the underlying disease causing the heart rhythym disturbance. If it is corrected quickly and (when present) hyperkalemia is reversed, the long-term prognosis is excellent. Your cat will require rest in a stress-free environment, away from other pets and active children, to help control the symptoms of persistent atrial standstill. Even with a pacemaker, however, the symptoms of lethargy and weakness may persist. Cats with pacemakers also require regular follow-up exams and periodic ECGs to monitor the effectiveness of the device and the heart's rhythm. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrioventricular_block_complete,Heart Block (Complete) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Much like a control center, the heart's sinoartial node (SA) is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate through the atrioventricular (AV) node and into the ventricles, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. Complete, or third-degree, atrioventricular block is a condition in which all impulses generated by the SA node are blocked at the AV node, leading to independent and non-coordinated beating of atria and ventricles. Complete heart block usually occurs in older cats except those having congenital (born with) heart disease. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Cats suffering from infections of the heart will demonstrate high white blood cell count on blood testing, while biochemistry profile may reveal electrolyte imbalances. Your veterinarian will record the electrocardiograph, or ECG, which is extremely beneficial to make an initial diagnosis. Echocardiography and Doppler ultrasound are performed in animals with abnormal ECG finding, and those with symptoms associated with heart issues. The ultimate goal of therapy is to clear the blockage of electrical impulses at the AV node. To achieve this, a special device called a pacemaker is used to resolve the electrical impulse conduction problems and normalize the heart's beating. (Chest x-rays are taken to confirm the proper placement of pacemaker.) Both temporary and permanent pacemakers are available, and your veterinarian will recommend which will work best for your cat. The blockage can be rectified surgically too, but this is often riskier for the cat. If your cat has had a pacemaker implanted, he will require extra care as well as cage rest. Typically, permanent pacemakers are placed in a pocket created surgically under the skin. To prevent the pacemaker from moving, a bandage is applied over the surgical wound for three to five days. Because pacemakers are battery operated, a malfunction can occur at any time; the pacemaker may also become infected, dislodged, or run out of battery. In such cases, the cat's heart may again go into a complete atrioventricular block. Therefore, it is vital that you restrict the cat's movements and monitor him for untoward symptoms. Depending on the severity of the underlying disease, the cat's diet may require modifying. In addition, you will need to visit your veterinarian at regular intervals for ECG and chest radiography, which are used to assess proper pacemaker function. Unfortunately, long term prognosis of cats with complete atrioventricular block is very poor. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrioventricular_block_first_degree,Heart Block (First-Degree) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Normally, a heart contraction is caused by an electrical impulse originating from the sinoatrial node, stimulating the atria, traveling to the atrioventricular node and finally to the ventricles. This electrical conduction system is responsible for controlling the heart rate, and generating electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. First-degree atrioventricular block is a condition in which the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is delayed, or prolonged. On an electrocardiogram (EKG) this shows as a prolonged PR interval -- the time between the main electrical impulse, called the P wave, and the QRS complex, which is recognized as the heart beat. First-degree AV block may be found in young, healthy cats due to a high vagal tone (impulses from the vagus nerve that produce an inhibition in the heart beat), or it may be found concurrent with a degenerative conduction system disease. Most cats with this condition will not display and symptoms. However, if induced by digoxin (heart medication) overdose, there may be a loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although it may occur in otherwise healthy cats, those on certain prescription medications, such as digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, and pilocarpine, may be predisposed to first-degree AV block. Some other common causes for the condition include: Low calcium, and certain drugs, may also predispose animals to first-degree AV block. First-degree AV block can also be caused by noncardiac diseases. In addition to the full physical exam, your veterinarian will take a complete background history of your cat's health, when the symptoms began and any other symptoms that may point your doctor to the underlying cause. Standard tests include a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count to check for imbalances or infections. An echocardiogram (EKG) will be conducted to rule out certain types of heart diseases, and X-ray or ultrasound imaging can be used for internal imaging of the heart, confirming the presence of masses, or ruling them out. Gastrointestinal disorders, high pressure in the eye and upper airway disease are some of the diseases that can lead this disorder, all of which are unrelated (directly) to the heart. An EKG recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal the exact abnormalities that are taking place in the cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Depending on the underlying disease causing the atrioventricular block, treatment will vary. Your veterinarian will prescribe diet guidelines as necessary to treat the underlying cause of the disease. You will need to follow-up with your veterinarian for regular appointments so that any changes can be addressed immediately. EKGs will be taken at each visit to follow the progress of the heart's ability to conduct properly. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrioventricular_block_second_degree_mobitz_type_II,Heart Block (Mobitz Type II)  in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The heart of a cat, like other mammalian hearts, is divided into four chambers. The two top chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium) and the bottom chambers are called the ventricles. The heart has an electrical conduction system that is responsible for controlling the heart rate. This electrical conduction system generates electrical impulses (waves), which propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart's muscles to contract and push blood through the interior arteries and out into the body. There are two nodes (masses of tissue) present in the heart that play an important role in this conduction system. The sinus node, or sinoatrial (SA) node, is a clustered collection of similar cells located in the right atrium, its purpose being to generate electrical impulses and to serve as the heart's pacemaker. The other node is called the atrioventricular (AV) node. Like the SA node, it is a clustered collection of similar cells situated in the right atrium, close to the ventricle. The AV node receives impulses from the SA node, and after a small delay, directs the impulses to the ventricles. This delay allows for the atrium to eject blood into the ventricle before the ventricular muscles contract. The AV node can also take the place of the SA node as the heart's pacemaker, should the SA node be affected adversely by a pathological condition of the heart. Second degree AV block in cats is a disease in which the above mentioned electrical conduction system goes off course, as some impulses are not passed down from the atria to the ventricles, thus impairing contraction and pumping functions of the heart muscles. AV block is rare in healthy cats but may be found in older cats. Some cats remain asymptomatic while other may show the following symptoms: In cases of digoxin (a drug used to treat many cardiac diseases) intoxication, an animal may show the following symptoms: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. A previous illness or treatment history is important in these cases. After performing a complete physical examination, your veterinarian will measure your cat's arterial blood pressure to check for hypertension (high blood pressure) related to cardiac disease. Laboratory tests include the standard complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These tests are of importance in the diagnosis of this problem as there are some biochemical changes that can predispose your cat to AV block. For example, if digoxin toxicity is suspected, the level of digoxin will be measured in your cat's serum. More specific tests may be conducted to evaluate the presence of infectious disease or parasitism. Blood culture/sensitivity tests will show evidence of a type of organism that is involved in infection and its sensitivity to various antibiotics. Other diagnostic tools that are important for the evaluation of the heart's structural and functional parameters include electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography for measuring the heart's electrical impulses. This disease is not aggressively treated in cats. If the heart rate is being maintained at a level at which the heart can pump an adequate amount of blood for normal body functions, generally no treatment will be required. If an underlying disease is responsible for the AV block, your veterinarian will treat it accordingly. There is no special nursing care that is required for these patients. If symptoms persist, strict cage rest is often recommended. Your veterinarian may also recommend a special diet for your cat if there is an underlying disease requiring dietary restrictions. It should be noted that if there is an underlying cause that is responsible for the AV block, it will need to be treated in order for the problem to be resolved. You will need to talk to your veterinarian about the various options available for treatment. In persistent cases, medication is not enough for long-term treatment of this problem. For such a case, a veterinarian may suggest a permanent pacemaker (a small device that is placed under the skin of the thoracic [chest] cavity to help control an abnormal heart rhythm) for long-term management. You may need to visit your veterinarian frequently for evaluation of your cat's current cardiac health status and progress, as this problem can lead to further serious complications if it is not monitored regularly.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrioventricular_block_mobitz_type_1,Heart Block (Mobitz Type I) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Second-degree atrioventricular block occurs when the electrical conduction within the AV node is delayed. The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. The atria, the two upper chambers of the heart that receive and send out blood, are prompted into action by the SA node's electrical impulse, which then activates the atrioventricular node (AV node). The AV node conducts the normal electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles, coordinating the mechanical activity so that the atria have forced the blood down into the ventricles before the ventricles contract to send the blood out into the body through the pulmonary artery and aortic artery. Most cats with this condition show no signs, appearing to be in perfect health. Low calcium levels and certain drugs (e.g., digoxin, bethanechol, physostigmine, pilocarpine) may predispose some cats to second-degree AV block–Mobitz Type 1. Second-degree AV block–Mobitz Type 1 can also be brought about by diseases unrelated to the heart. This condition is uncommon in cats, but has been documented. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a full physical exam, with a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count. A thorough history from you will allow your veterinarian to rule out masses, gastrointestinal disorders, high pressure in the eye and upper airway disease. X-rays may help detect some of these disorders as well. An atropine response test, which increases the firing action of the sinoatrial node and conduction of the AV node will indicate if the disease is originating from the heart. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Treatment will vary depending on the underlying disease causing the second-degree–Mobitz Type 1 atrioventricular block. Cats that are diagnosed with this condition are often given a guarded prognosis, as the condition will progress without intervention. A pacemaker may be necessary. Your veterinarian will guide you through a health plan for your cat that emphasizes the necessary diet and activity guidelines that will effectively treat the underlying cause of disease, if one is present.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_left_anterior_fascicular_block,Heart Block or Conduction Delay (Left Anterior) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Left Anterior Fascicular Block (LAFB) is a condition that affects the heart's conduction system, which is responsible for generating electrical impulses (waves) that propagate throughout the musculature of the heart, stimulating the heart muscles to contract and pump blood. If the conduction system is disrupted, not only will contraction of the heart muscles be affected, but the timing and frequency of heartbeats too. This is the most commonly described form of bundle branch block in cats. There are no specific symptoms related to this condition itself, rather, related to the underlying cause of the LAFB. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which may reveal electrolyte imbalances. Electrocardiography, however, remains the most important tool for diagnosis. Your veterinarian will record your cat’s electrocardiogram (ECG) and compare it with a normal ECG to see if any abnormalities are present. Further evaluation of the heart is usually done with echocardiography. This helps in the diagnosis of underlying heart disease or problem, and the extent of heart involvement. Your veterinarian will also take X-rays of both the thoracic and abdominal regions to see if there are any abnormal masses, tumor, foreign body, and/or abnormal heart position. The form of treatment recommended for your cat grossly depends on the diagnosis and may vary patient to patient. Therefore, correctly diagnosing the underlying cause of the LAFB is paramount. Prognosis and follow-up exam schedules varies greatly depending on the underlying disease. However, in cases of severe or advanced heart problems or cancer, prognosis is not good.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_left_bundle_branch_block,Heart Block or Conduction Delay (Left Bundle) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) is a defect in the heart’s electrical conduction system. It occurs when the left ventricle (one of the cat's four heart chambers) is not directly activated by the electric impulses through the left posterior and anterior fascicles of the left bundle branch, causing the deflections in the electrocardiographic tracing (QRS) to become wide and bizarre. LBBB may be complete or partial in nature. Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to LBBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific. Left bundle branch block is often only found accidentally, perhaps while performing an echocardiogram. In the case of this defect, he or she may identify structural defects in the heart without left-side enlargement. Thoracic and abdominal radiography may also show masses and other abnormalities, while Holter monitoring may reveal intermittent LBBB. Treatment is directed towards treating underlying cause. This condition itself is not life-threatening and treating the underlying cause results in complete resolution of problem. However, if left untreated, LBBB can lead to more severe heart rhythm changes or even complete heart block. You may be required to take your pet for regular follow-ups exams to evaluate the status of disease and the cat's response to treatment.

RBBB may be complete or partial in nature; however, it is not as frequent as left anterior fascicular block. Often, no specific symptoms are seen that can be attributed to RBB, only those that are related to the underlying disease causing the defect. Although it may be present in normal cats, a right bundle branch block is more often associated with congenital (present at birth) heart disease(s). Other typical causes for the defect include: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically non-specific.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_hemangiosarcoma_heart,Heart Cancer (Hemagiosarcoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A hemangiosarcoma of the heart is a tumor that originates in the blood vessels that line the heart. Hemangio refers to the blood vessels and sarcoma a type of aggressive, malignant cancer that arises from the connective tissues of the body. A hemangiosarcoma may originate in the heart, or it may have metastasized to the heart from another location in the body. This tumor often will go undetected until complications arise. Because a hemangiosarcoma arises from the blood vessels, when it reaches an unsustainable size it will burst, often resulting in life threatening internal bleeding. Other typical symptoms relate to the size of the tumor interfering with the heart's ability to function. The pumping of blood into or out of the heart organ may be blocked or slowed, resulting in an irregular heart rhythm; the pericardial sac that surrounds the heart may become filled with blood due to burst vessels, or with fluid that places restrictive pressure on the heart; or there may be a responsive abdominal swelling that puts pressure on the heart and other organs. In addition, the blood loss may lead to a regenerative anemia, with concurrent symptoms that can confound the initial diagnosis. Most symptoms are seen related to complications affecting heart rather than tumor itself. The exact cause is still unknown. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and any incidents of ill health, behavioral changes, or accidents that have recently taken place. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being primarily affected and which organs are being affected secondarily. Your cat's age, breed, and the outward symptoms that are presenting will be the initial signals for a rough diagnosis. Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The blood tests may reveal anemia, as often the blood loss will lead to a state of regenerative anemia, where the body is lacking in sufficient red blood cells, but is still capable of producing more of them – though it may not be able to keep with the demand. Your veterinarian will want to take fluid samples from both the abdomen and the chest, by abdominocentesis and pericardiocentesis respectively, for cytological analysis. This can also be used to remove excess fluid so that your cat is more comfortable. Blood found in the fluid sample is a frequent sign of hemangiosarcoma, and failure of clotting in the blood when it is drawn is another telling indication, since the body is working hard to maintain its blood balance and is using the blood clotting factors too rapidly. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Your veterinarian may also need to take a surgical tissue sample of the mass for examination (biopsy). Visual diagnostic methods, such as x-rays and ultrasound of the thoracic (chest) and abdominal cavities may reveal variations in cardiac size and structure. Echocardiography is the most valuable tool for making accurate diagnosis. It will confirm the presence of fluid, structural abnormalities in the heart, the presence of a tumor mass or clot, and other aspects of tumors within the heart. This tumor is very difficult to treat as it tends to rapidly metastasize to different locations in the body. Treatment involves treating both the primary disease as well as the complications that have arisen due to the tumor. Chemotherapy is often recommended for slowing the progression of metastasis, but this alone will not stop the disease spread. Because of the vulnerable nature of the location of this sarcoma, it is often neither practical or even possible to recommend surgery with any hopes of success. Your veterinarian may drain the fluid that has accumulated within the thoracic and/or abdominal cavity, and pain medications will be prescribed by your veterinarian to relieve your cat's discomfort. Unfortunately, this disease has a poor prognosis, and even successful treatments may only add months to your cat's life. The location of this tumor (heart) makes it especially life-threatening, so the prognosis is very poor in most patients. In almost all cases, tumor metastasis has already taken place into the lungs at the time of diagnosis, making treatment more difficult. Even after surgery, recurrence is common. The life expectancy for affected animals is less than six months. Watch for symptoms associated with recurrence and involvement of other body sites. If you notice your cat having difficulty breathing, sudden behavioral changes, which may indicate metastasis to the brain, or any other symptoms, call your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will prescribe a pain protocol for your cat, as well as a diet that is especially designed for cancer patients. Consult your veterinarian for advice on making your cat as comfortable as possible, as end of life arrangements may need to made as the hemangiosarcoma progresses. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_patent_ductus_arteriosus,Heart Defect (Congenital) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The aorta is the main artery that feeds oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to the body. The pulmonary (lung) artery carries deoxygenated blood to be oxygenated, traveling from the right side of the heart to the lungs. Once the blood has been oxygenated by the lungs, it then returns to the left side of the heart, through the pulmonary veins to be pumped out into the body by the aorta. In the womb, the fetus’ descending aorta is connected to the pulmonary artery by the ductus arteriosus blood vessel, allowing blood to flow directly from the right side of the heart to the aorta, without stopping for oxygen in the lungs. This is because the fetus gets its oxygen from the mother's bloodstream and does not yet need to have its own blood oxygenated. Normally at birth, this connection is no longer patent (open). Once a newborn has begun to breath on its own, the pulmonary artery opens to allow blood to flow from the right side heart into the lungs to be oxygenated, and the ductus arteriosus closes. But in patent ductus arteriosis (PDA) the connection remains patent. Consequently, blood is shunted (diverted) in abnormal patterns in the heart. PDA allows blood to flow from the aorta into the pulmonary artery, and then to the lungs. If the shunt is moderate to large, it can cause left-sided congestive heart failure from blood volume overload on the left side of the heart. Less frequently, a large-diameter PDA will cause injury to the blood vessels in the lungs, from the excess amount of blood flowing into the lungs. High blood pressure in the lungs, and reversal of the shunt so that the blood goes from right to left (pulmonary artery to the aorta), as well as the typical PDA shunt direction of left to right (aorta to pulmonary artery) can be expected. This atypical right to left shunting of a PDA can cause the aorta to carry blood that is low in oxygen, sending a signal to the body to produce more red blood cells (since they carry oxygen), making the blood too thick. The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. You will need to give a thorough history of your pet's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. The level of oxygen in your pet's blood may also be tested, with samples taken from different locations for comparison. Visualization of the heart, using radiograph and ultrasound imaging, is very instrumental for an accurate diagnosis of PDA. Often what will be seen in an X-ray is left heart enlargement; right to left (“reversed”) PDA will show a heart of normal size on an X-ray. The cat may be given oxygen therapy, nitrates, and cage rest. When your pet has regained stability, it will be scheduled for surgery as soon as possible. Cats with right to left shunting PDA should never have surgical correction. Cats with a normal left to right PDA shunt can be treated normally after they have been allowed two weeks to recover from their surgical correction. Because this trait is genetically transmitted, cats that have had a PDA should not be bred. The best way to avoid this is to have your pet spayed or neutered, and to make sure that you know your cat's hereditary history. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_restrictive_cardiomyopathy,Heart Disease Caused by Scarring of the Heart Muscles in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A cat's heart is composed of four chambers: the top two chambers are the left and right atria and the bottom two chambers are the left and right ventricles. The valves of the heart are located between the left atrium and the left ventricle (the mitral valve), between the right atrium and the right ventricle (the tricuspid valve), from the left ventricle to the aorta (the main artery of the body, the valve of which is the aortic valve), and between the right ventricle to the main pulmonary artery (the pulmonary, or lung valve). Cardiomyopathy is the medical term for disease of the heart muscle. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the muscle is stiff and does not expand, such that blood cannot fill the ventricles normally. Restrictive cardiomyopathy in cats is characterized by abnormal filling of the chambers of the heart (known as diastolic dysfunction), severe atrial enlargement, normal left ventricular wall thickness and variable abnormal pumping of the heart (known as systolic dysfunction). Scar tissue of the heart muscle layer may be present. Other heart-muscle disorders, including inflammatory or immune-mediated diseases, may also be present. Your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical exam with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis to rule out other causes of disease. will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Your veterinarian will also order an electrocardiogram to evaluate the electrical conductivity of the heart’s beat for abnormalities. X-rays and an echocardiogram are essential in assessing heart disease and its consequences. X-rays of the lungs should also be taken to check for fluid accumulation. If your cat is mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic it can be treated on an outpatient basis. Patients with acute, severe congestive heart failure should be hospitalized for emergency care, and patients with severe breathing difficulty will receive oxygen. Low-sodium fluids may be administered cautiously if dehydration occurs, and a heating pad may be necessary for hypothermic patients. Any life-threatening fluid in the chest cavity will need to be reduced. At home, you will need to maintain a low-stress environment to decrease anxiety for your cat. An enclosed space, such as a room, or if necessary, cage rest, will be best for your cat during its recovery. Keeping activity to a minimum is essential for healing. Protecting your cat from active children, guests, and other pets will help in its recovery as well. If your cat is having trouble eating, hand feeding should be employed. Ask your veterinarian for guidance when choosing which foods will best during the recovery period. If your cat refuses to eat, you may need to have nutrition given intravenously. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary to assess your cat’s response to treatment and to assess resolution of swelling and fluid retention. Bloodwork, x-rays and an electrocardiogram should be repeated at each visit. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat shows signs of trouble breathing, exercise intolerance or weakness.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/heart-disease-cats,Heart Disease in Cats,"Heart disease, also called cardiomyopathy, ultimately affects the ability of the heart to contract, the strength of those contractions, and the overall amount of blood distributed to the body. The feline heart is a muscle made up of four chambers—two atria and two ventricles. The atria serve as receptacles for blood entering the heart, from the lungs on the left side and the body on the right side. From there, blood is pumped into the ventricles and then either flows into the lungs from the right side to pick up oxygen or out from the left side into the aorta (the body’s largest artery) to deliver oxygenated blood to the body. Because the heart is a muscle, doing any work outside of its normal job causes it to thicken and become enlarged. As the muscle walls thicken, they become less elastic and less able to relax, preventing the ventricles from filling up with adequate blood. As a result, the blood backs up into the lungs and heart failure develops. The thickening that occurs can also lead to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) as well as the development of clots . Heart disease in cats can occur as the result of many different abnormal processes in the heart, such as abnormal rhythm, abnormal heart muscle, abnormal contraction, valve disease, or some combination of the above. Heart muscle disease has traditionally been classified as either primary (congenital) or acquired. Primary (congenital, meaning a birth defect) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) , either with or without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM), is the most common form of heart disease in cats. In this disease, the left ventricular muscle walls become thickened. HCM is a progressive disease and SAM occurs when the mitral valve gets “sucked” into the aorta during contraction, causing a temporary blockage, restricting blood flow, and increasing pressure. Acquired (developed as cat ages): Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is often attributed to a nutritional deficiency in the amino acid taurine. DCM is a widening of all heart chambers, which leads to thinner walls and an increased workload of the heart, ultimately with loss of contraction strength and heart failure. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) , where the muscle becomes tough and less flexible; usually the left ventricle is only mildly enlarged; however, the atria are enlarged and mitral valve insufficiency is usually present. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) , where the right ventricle becomes dilated with thinner walls. This cardiomyopathy often leads to right-sided heart failure . Unclassified cardiomyopathy (UCM) is used as a catch-all term for those diseases that do not fit into any specific category. There are also other types of heart disease that can occur secondarily as a complication of another disease, such as cancer, hyperthyroidism , or hypertension (high blood pressure) . Many cats with heart disease can be asymptomatic (show no visible signs), which makes diagnosing the condition challenging. Unfortunately, for some cats, the only symptom is sudden death. Other cats may experience the following: Abdominal distension Abnormal heart sounds such as murmur , arrhythmia, or gallop rhythm Collapse Cool extremities (cat is cold to the touch) Decreased appetite Heart failure Lethargy Pale or blue gums Respiratory changes such as increased respiratory rate, open mouth breathing, panting, labored breathing, and cough (rarely) “Stretching” postures Sudden hind limb paresis or paralysis, most often caused by a saddle thrombus (clot) and accompanied with pain and vocalization Vomiting Weak pulses, felt on the inside of the cat’s thighs HCM has been shown to be inherited, often by genetic mutation, in purebred cats such as Maine Coons and Ragdolls , and is more prevalent in male cats. Other predisposed breeds for HCM and heart disease include the Persian , Sphynx , American Shorthairs , and British Shorthairs . Testing for this condition is available through a DNA/genetics test . Cats with an underlying heart disease do not always have a heart murmur that can be detected in a routine exam. In fact, about one-third to one-half of cats diagnosed with HCM have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis, and many cats may sadly only experience sudden death. Therefore, when symptoms are present, it’s critical to have your cat examined by a veterinarian. Several tests are often recommended to help determine the cause of your cat’s specific heart disease. An echocardiogram, or ultrasound of the heart, is considered the best diagnostic tool, as it can determine the ventricle wall thickness, pressures within the heart, valve conformation and ability, and presence of clots. It is the only method to differentiate the different types of heart disease. Additional tests your vet may recommend for your cat include: Treatment will depend on the type and degree of heart disease present, often influenced by the presence of heart failure, degree of thickening, strength of muscle contractions, and the ability of the valves to function. Your cat will be assessed, a physical exam performed, and supportive care measures taken, which often will include oxygen therapy as well as mild sedation or anti-anxiety medication to minimize stress and slow your cat’s breathing. Thoracocentesis or abdominocentesis, a procedure where fluid is removed from the chest or abdomen, may be necessary to help your cat breathe. Medical management often includes some combination of the following: ACE inhibitors , such as enalapril : to help reduce blood pressure and the heart’s workload. Anticoagulants , such as heparin or warfarin: often utilized in the presence of known clots or to help break down clots. Antiplatelet therapy , such as aspirin or clopidogrel : to help prevent clot formation. Beta blockers , such as atenolol : an antiarrhythmic medication that also helps decrease the heart rate and helps regulate blood pressure. Calcium channel blockers , such as diltiazem : to relax the heart. Diuretics , such as furosemide : to draw the fluid off the lungs. Dietary management with well-balanced, high-quality food that meets the requirements for taurine or taurine supplementation may be needed. In addition, diets low in sodium such as Royal Canin® Renal Support are typically recommended. Cats that are diagnosed with hypertension (high blood pressure) or hyperthyroidism can often be regulated with medications. Hyperthyroidism can be treated with surgery, medication, diet, or radiation. Unfortunately, resolution of an underlying heart disease is not possible in many cats, so it can only be managed as best as possible. Lifespan is variable, as some cats with heart disease can experience a normal life and then die from an unrelated condition. Other cats can die quite suddenly, even with the best of medical care. Providing a relatively stress-free lifestyle for your cat is important, as is monitoring for changes in her behavior, appetite, and breathing rate. There are certain phone apps you can use, such as Pet Breath Counter , to document your cat’s respiratory rate and show trends and values over time. (A respiratory rate of greater than 30 while at rest should prompt immediate veterinary attention!) Medications are often the mainstay of acute and long-term therapy. It is important to never discontinue medication without consulting your veterinarian first. One study concluded that the average survival time for cats with HCM is about five to six years. For cats with heart failure, the time frame is roughly three to 18 months. It’s important to note that not all cats with heart disease will experience heart failure. Commonly, the signs of heart disease in cats are decreased appetite, lethargy, changes in your cat’s breathing, and abnormal heart sounds like a murmur or arrhythmia. Sadly, sometimes the only sign that may be witnessed is acute collapse and death. It is possible for cats to recover. However, heart failure is often a progressive disease and will likely recur. It’s important to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for rechecks and follow-up testing to ensure your cat is on the best course of therapy.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_sick_sinus_syndrome,Heart Disease of the Sinus Node in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart's contractions by firing off electrical surges. One of the disorders that can affect the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node is called sick sinus syndrome (SSS). This disorder complicates conduction of the electrical impulse out of the sinus node and the specialized conduction system of the heart. Secondary pacemakers, such as the muscle fibers of the sinus node, will also be affected by sick sinus syndrome. (Note: the body's natural pacemakers are responsible for setting the pace for the heart's rhythm and generating the electrical impulses within the muscle tissue.) Any irregular contraction of the heart (arrhythmia) will be visible on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, in which the heart beats too slowly, and then too quickly, is a variant of sick sinus syndrome. Clinical signs of sick sinus syndrome in cats will become apparent when organs begin to dysfunction because they are not receiving a normal amount of blood supply. If your cat tends to be fairly inactive under normal circumstances, it will take longer for symptoms of sick sinus syndrome to become apparent. When symptoms do show, those that will generally present are: Some of the suspected relationships to SSS are genetic, however, the causes for this condition are mostly unknown. One possible cause is when there is a heart disease that is cutting off the blood supply to or from the heart, disrupting normal heart function and electrical functionality. Cancer in the thoracic or pulmonary (both refer to the chest) region may also lead to SSS. A complete physical exam will be performed by your veterinarian. It will include a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to verify proper organ function. You will be asked to provide a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history and onset of symptoms, and possible incidents or recent health conditions that might have precipitated this condition. The history you give your veterinarian may provide clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily. In order to to assess sinus node function, a provocative atropine response test may be done. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action (output of electrical impulses) of the SA Node. An ECG may be indicated in certain breeds that are predisposed to SSS, as these same breeds are often predisposed to other diseases of the heart valves (the valves that separate the four chambers of the heart). Hence, if there is a heart murmur, disease of any of the heart’s valves should first be ruled out. Only cats showing clinical signs need treatment, and only cats requiring electrophysiologic testing of the heart, or implantation of an artificial pacemaker will need to be hospitalized. Attempts to manage an abnormally fast or abnormally slow heart rate, without prior pacemaker implantation, carries a significant risk of worsening the extremes of the abnormal heart rate syndrome. You will need to keep your cat's physical activity to a minimum while it is healing from this condition. Encourage rest in a quiet, non-stressful environment as much as possible, away from other pets or active children. Cage rest may be recommended for the interim. Although therapy for SSS may appear to work at the beginning of treatment, medical therapy commonly does not have long term benefits. The only solution in these instances is surgical correction.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_left_sided_congestive_heart_failure,"Heart Failure, Congestive (Left-sided) in Cats","PetMD Editorial The heart has four chambers: two chambers at the top, the right and left atria; and two chambers on the bottom, the right and left ventricles. The right side of the heart collects blood from the body and pumps it into the lungs, where the blood is oxygenated. The oxygen rich blood is then collected by the left side of the heart, and from there it is pumped out into the body's various organs. Congestive left-sided heart failure refers to a condition in which the left side of the heart is not able to push blood through the body efficiently enough to meet the metabolic needs of the body, and frequently results in blood pooling in the lungs. Low blood output from the heart causes tiredness, exercise intolerance and fainting. Muscle failure of the left ventricle (the left lower chamber of the heart): Pressure overload of the left heart: Volume overload of the left heart (the mitral valve on the left side of the heart, separating the left atrium from the left ventricle): Difficulties filling the left heart with blood: Heart beat rhythm disturbances: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history, onset of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A blood chemical profile, complete blood count, urinalysis and an electrolyte panel will be ordered to check the underlying cause of the heart disease and its severity. Your veterinarian will also draw blood from your cat to check thyroid function. Imaging studies can be used to gain a further understanding of your cat's heart condition. X-ray and ultrasound imaging may be used, as well as electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recordings for examining the electrical currents in the heart muscles. These recordings may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Treatment will depend on the exact underlying cause of the cardiac disease. Most patients suffering from left-sided congestive heart failure can be treated on an outpatient basis. However, if your cat is having trouble breathing it should be placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) in an oxygen cage. Your veterinarian will also recommend hospitalization if your cat is presenting with very low blood pressure. Surgical intervention may benefit select patients with congenital defects, such as malformations of the heart that were present at birth, and some forms of congenital and acquired heart valve disease. Your veterinarian will also prescribe medications for the heart, if appropriate, and will advise you in a diet and exercise plan that will keep your cat's blood pressure down and relieve pressure on the heart muscle, while hopefully strengthening its ability to pump blood. Left sided congestive heart failure is an incurable disease. Your cat will need to have its activity restricted to some extent to relieve pressure on the heart. While may cats do spend a lot of time resting, if your cat is still highly active, even with this condition, you may need to put some barriers in place for your cat's well being (such as intermittent cage rest, or creating an environment for your cat that limits jumping and running). Your cat should also be fed a moderately sodium-restricted diet that is high in nutrients. This diet may be changed to a severely sodium-restricted diet if the disease worsens, but your veterinarian will determine if this is appropriate. Diet changes should only be made with a veterinarian's approval. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_congestive_heart_failure_right_sided,"Heart Failure, Congestive (Right-sided) in Cats","PetMD Editorial Right-sided congestive heart failure occurs when the heart fails to pump blood at the rate required to meet the basic needs of the body. While it is not curable, there are treatment options that can improve the quality of life for your cat. All organ systems in the body can be affected by congestive heart failure. Common signs include weakness, lethargy, difficulty breathing, an enlarged liver, and abdominal distension. Upon physical examination, several signs of disease may present, including jugular vein distention, heart murmur, and rapid, shallow breathing. Heartworms are one of the causes for congestive heart failure, but in some cases, congenital heart failure stems from hereditary causes. In other cases, a weak heart muscle can cause congestive heart failure. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Other diagnostic tests include heartworm testing and fluid analysis to determine the cause. In addition, you will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily. Additionally, if there is any information you can give about your cat's familial line, it can help your doctor to pinpoint the origin of the heart condition. Your veterinarian will need to differentiate between all of the different causes for the heart failure when examining your cat. Unless the condition is severe, your cat will most likely be treated on an outpatient basis. Some of the treatment options that are used to treat this condition include a restriction on activity and a reduction of sodium in the diet. In some cases, surgery will be required. If there is a build up of fluid in the abdomen or chest, a technique called tapping can be used to remove some of the excess fluid. Following treatment, it is important to administer the full course of prescribed medication and observe any abnormalities in your cat's behavior. It will also be necessary to monitor your cat's kidney health. This disease is not curable, so ongoing management will be required. Preventing right-sided congestive heart failure is dependent on the underlying cause of the disease. For example, if heartworms are causing the heart disease, you will need to ensure that your cat is taking heartworm medication regularly, and that you revisit your veterinarian for routine wellness checkups.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_sinus_arrest_sinoatrial_block,Heart Impulse Block in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The sinoatrial node (SA Node, or SAN), also called the sinus node, is the initiator of electrical impulses within the heart, triggering the heart to beat, or contract, by firing off electrical surges. Sinus arrest is a disorder of heart beat impulse formation caused by a slowing down or cessation of spontaneous sinus nodal automaticity – the automatic behavior of the tissues that set the pace for the heart's rhythm. It is the failure of the sinoatrial (SA) node to initiate an impulse at the expected time that leads to sinus arrest. Persistent sinus arrest that is not due to the use of a drug is often indicative of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) - a disorder of the heart’s electrical impulse formation within the sinus node. Sinoatrial block is a disorder of impulse conduction. This is when an impulse formed within the sinus node fails to be conducted through the atria (the interior of the heart), or when it does so with delay. Most commonly, the basic rhythm of the sinus node is not disturbed when the impulses fail to conduct properly. Sinoatrial block is classified into first, second, and third-degree SA block (similar to degrees of atrioventricular [AV] block). It is difficult to diagnose first and third-degree SA block from an electrocardiogram (ECG) reading only. Second-degree SA block is the most common type of SA block, and the only degree that can be recognized on a surface ECG. In addition, there are two types of second-degree SA blocks: Mobitz type I (also called Wenckebach periodicity) and Mobitz type II. First-degree sinoatrial block Second-degree sinoatrial block Third-degree sinoatrial block Physiologic Pathologic Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat, with a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel and a urinalysis. The electrolyte panel may show hyperkalemia, abnormal levels of potassium in the blood, which can lead to arrhythmias. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a history of symptoms, and their onset. Thoracic (chest) x-rays and/or a cardiac ultrasound imaging may be taken by your veterinarian to confirm or rule out heart disease and abnormal tissue growth (neoplasia). A provocative atropine response test may be done to assess sinus node function. This test uses the drug atropine to stimulate the firing action of the SA Node. Cats with SSS generally will have no response, or will have an incomplete response to the atropine. Most patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Only patients showing clinical signs of illness should be hospitalized. Fluid therapy will be given to patients in need of it. Very ill patients that are not responding to medical therapy may require implantation of an artificial pacemaker, and will be hospitalized prior to surgery in preparation of it. If your pet becomes excessively weak, or is showing signs of losing consciousness, or fainting, it will need to have its activity restricted. After care will be dependent on whether your cat has an underlying disease, along with the SA block. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments as necessary, and an ECG reading will be done at each visit to follow your cat's progress. If your cat becomes weak, or loses consciousness, contact your veterinarian immediately for advisement. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_myocarditis,Heart Inflammation (Myocarditis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Inflammation of the heart's muscular wall (or myocardium) is medically referred to as myocarditis. It is often caused by bacterial, viral, rikettsial, funal, and protozoal infections, which may affect the heart directly or reach the heart from other body parts. Clinical symptoms depend on the type of infection and extent of lesions, but in severe cases, heart failure may result. The inflammation itself may be focal or diffused throughout the myocardium. Other symptoms associated with myocarditis include: Although viral, bacterial, rikettsial, funal, and protozoal infections are the most common cause of myocaditis, drug toxicity to the heart can also be a factor. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, paying close attention to the cat's cardiovascular system. Various laboratory tests -- such as complete blood count (CBC), blood culture biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- will be used to isolate and identify the causative organism. The abnormalities revealed by these tests, however, will depend on the affected organ. Your veterinarian will also perform an echocardiogram (EKG) on the cat to evaluate the extent of myocardial damage and abnormal accumulation of fluid around the heart. In addition to evaluating the abnormalities related to heart dysfunction, EKG findings help in differentiating the location of the lesions within heart. Thoracic X-rays, meanwhile, help evaluate the heart size, whether fluids are located in the lungs, and other such abnormalities. Other more specific testing include pathological exams of fluid samples taken from around the heart. Cats with severe myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or severe heart rhythm problems may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment. If specific causative organism is identified, infection will be treated with suitable medicine, such as antibiotics to fight off bacterial infections. There are also medications to correct heart rhythym issues, should the cat be suffering from them. In some patients, a pacemaker may need to be implanted. The overall prognosis for myocarditis depends on the extent and severity of disease. Cats with CHF as a result of myocarditis, for example, have very poor prognosis, while those with milder forms of the disease respond well to treatment. You will need to visit your veterinarian regularly for follow-up evaluation and frequent laboratory testing will be conducted to monitor progress and response to treatment. Limiting your cat's activity is important for recovery, as well as setting aside a quiet place for it to rest, away from household activity, children, and other pets. Certain diet restrictions may be recommended, especially those concerning your cat's salt intake. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_digoxin_toxicity,Heart Medicine Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Digoxin is commonly used for treating congestive heart failure, its primary benefit being to help the heart contract. While digoxin can be an extremely useful medication, the difference between a therapeutic dosage and a toxic dosage can be negligible, and overdoses frequently occur. For this reason, your veterinarian will need to monitor digoxin blood levels throughout treatment. Owners also need to be aware of toxicity signs, as they can be subtle and may have the same symptoms as heart failure. One of the most significant concerns about this condition is toxicity to the heart cells themselves, called myocardial toxicity. When this occurs, abnormal heart rhythms can occur, often leading to heart failure. Depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea are often the first symptoms your cat will display. This can occur even when the medication is given at the prescribed dose because therapeutic and toxic levels are very close. With acute overdose, your cat may become comatose or have seizures. Any time toxicity is a concern, it is important to consult with your veterinarian, as the effects of toxicity can progress quickly. It is important to take routine blood samples to assess the digoxin level in your cat's serum. Doses are initially based on lean body weight, but individual cats metabolize the drug differently. For this reason, your veterinarian will take blood samples to determine serum digoxin levels throughout the treatment. Additional blood analyses for electrolytes, organ function and cell counts are also important. An electrocardiogram, which checks for arrhythmias, is critical for determining the prognosis and an appropriate treatment plan. No additional digoxin should be given once you have noticed symptoms of toxicity in your cat. It is important that your cat receive emergency medical attention immediately if there is an overdose, because toxicity can quickly lead to death. If an acute overdose has taken place, it may also be necessary to induce vomiting by using activated charcoal or other approved methods. Your cat's fluid and electrolyte balance will also need to be corrected, as these abnormalities are a significant contributor to the toxic affects of the digoxin the heart. If an abnormal rhythm is present, antiarrhythmic medications may be given. A continuous electrocardiogram may be positioned on your cat to monitor its heart rhythm. Antibody therapy, which uses an agent to bind with the cardiac stimulant that is in the blood stream, is used in humans with digoxin toxicity and has also been used on cats. However, the medication can be costly. Management of the disease will change, and different medications will be prescribed because congestive heart failure is progressive. Careful management and frequent follow-up exams are critical, especially if digoxin is related with another treatment plan. Expect to have your cat's blood levels checked periodically throughout treatment. Having a digoxin toxicity episode may be a concern, but lower doses can begin again after the blood has dropped below toxic range and your cat has no further signs of toxicity. Recent reports have indicated that using digoxin at levels below therapeutic levels can be beneficial and safer. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_heart_murmur,Heart Murmur in Cats: What It Is and How to Manage,"iStock/Vasyl Dolmatov A heart murmur is an abnormal heart sound noted when listening to your pet’s heart with a stethoscope. A heart murmur results from an underlying health condition, such as weak heart valves that triggers this abnormal sound. Typically, there are only two heart sounds that are considered normal. An extra heart sound or a “whooshing” noise heard when the heart beats is considered a heart murmur and is a common finding in middle aged to older cats . In some cases, it can be found in younger cats and can be a concern for congenital issues (those present at birth), but this is quite rare . The “whooshing” noise or heart murmur itself is caused by turbulent (rough) blood flow through the heart. Blood should flow through the four normal chambers of the heart and through the valves (doorways between chambers) in a smooth, calm way. When there are barriers to flow, turbulence occurs and it changes the normal “lub” and “dub” heart sounds. Turbulence can be caused by heart valve malfunctions, holes in the walls of the heart or arteries, or narrowing of blood vessels or heart chambers. Turbulence can also occur from excitation and fast heart rates or thinning of the blood ( anemia ). Heart murmurs are classified three ways: Based on their grade (the loudness of the murmur) Configuration (when the murmur is the loudest during contraction and relaxation of the heart) Location of the murmur (when listening with a stethoscope) Veterinarians grade heart murmurs on a scale of 1–6 depending on how loud the heart murmur is upon listening. This is a subjective scale based on what the specific veterinarian hears while listening to the heart with a stethoscope. The grade for heart murmurs include: Grade I: audible only to a trained ear or hardly heard at all Grade II: soft but audible Grade III: intermediate and the most common grade of heart murmur Grade IV: louder murmur that radiates across the heart, often on both sides of the chest Grade V: loud heart murmur with a noticeable “thrill” or vibration felt when touching the chest wall Grade VI: loudest heart murmur heard before the stethoscope even touches the chest and often has a noticeable “thrill” or vibration felt when touching the chest wall Finding the location of the heart murmur is difficult in cats because of their small chest cavities, and it’s often heard best along the sternum. The grade, location, and configuration of heart murmurs is helpful for finding the underlying cause. Heart murmurs can be congenital or acquired. Congenital heart murmurs are present at birth or soon after birth and are often associated with heart defects. These types of murmurs can be quiet early in life and are not always found until later with growth and maturation. Acquired heart murmurs occur at any point in life and can be benign (no underlying disease causing the murmur) in cause or may be associated with heart disease ( HCM in cats ). Some heart murmurs are called “innocent” or benign. This means that there is no underlying heart disease causing the abnormal heart sounds. They are found often in cats of any age and are usually intermittent (sounds come and go) and are quiet when listened to with a stethoscope. Pet parents will typically not notice any symptoms in cats until heart disease progresses and signs of congestive heart failure or thromboembolism (blood clots) develop. Heart murmurs are usually found incidentally during a routine physical examination. Your veterinarian will discuss possible causes and next steps for diagnosis. Symptoms of severe heart disease, heart failure, and thromboembolism include: Chronic weight loss or muscle wasting Decreased appetite Hiding behavior Weakness Coughing or wheezing Exercise intolerance—panting with mild exertion Increased respiratory rate at rest Increased effort to breathe Fluid from mouth or nostrils Change in the color of the gums to blue, gray, or white Lethargy Collapse Paralysis of the hind limbs Painful vocalization Stunted growth in kittens with severe congenital causes The cause of a heart murmur in a cat can be due to various underlying conditions such as: Anemia Anxiety High blood pressure Heart disease Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) Heart wall defects or holes in the heart walls (atrial or ventricular septal defects) Heart valve deficiencies: mitral, tricuspid, or aortic valves Stenosis (narrowing) of the valves: subaortic, aortic, mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonic valves Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): a congenital heart defect where an important blood vessel fails to close properly following birth Tetralogy of Fallot: severe congenital malformations of the heart Thromboemboli (blood clots) in the heart or vessels Heartworm disease Endocarditis (infection of one or more heart valves) Maine Coons are prone to moderate to severe HCM and HOCM. Persian cats , American Shorthairs, and British Shorthairs are also prone to less severe cases of inherited HCM. Siamese cats have a higher rate of congenital PDA and inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The cause of a heart murmur in a cat is typically not found by using a stethoscope alone to listen to the lungs, though this can be helpful in determining the location, configuration, and grade of the murmur. Unfortunately, a benign or innocent heart murmur can sound like a heart murmur caused by severe heart disease in a cat. So all heart murmurs will need to be evaluated thoroughly by a veterinarian to ensure the health of your cat. Your veterinarian will likely recommend full blood work , including a cardiac proBNP, which gives a quantifiable number value to the amount of stretch on the heart muscle itself. Concerning symptoms and consistently increased levels of proBNP can suggest underlying heart disease in cats. Blood work can help rule out anemia or underlying systemic disease, such as hyperthyroidism , which can contribute to heart disease. Chest radiographs are often recommended to assess the size of the heart, to evaluate the vessels going to and from the heart, and to assess the lungs for any signs of fluid or congestive heart failure (CHF). An echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart is considered the gold standard to investigate the underlying cause of a heart murmur. Sometimes an electrocardiogram (EKG) is recommended if an abnormal heart rhythm is noted. A heart murmur itself does not require treatment, but the underlying cause of the heart murmur may need to be addressed. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and severity of the heart murmur. Benign or innocent murmurs usually require no treatment at all. Often, cat age, overall health, and the cost of therapy are major considerations with treatment of heart disease in cats. CHF, depending on its severity, often requires hospitalization, diuretics ( furosemide ), cardiac medications ( benazepril ), and oxygen therapy. In many cases of CHF in cats, pleural effusion (fluid buildup around the lungs) needs to be removed by a procedure called thoracocentesis to allow the lungs to fully expand again. Some congenital heart murmurs, such as small holes in the heart walls (or septal defects), may resolve within six months as the animal grows. In some cases of congenital heart disease in cats, surgery is necessary to close a PDA or septal defect. Treatment of other underlying health conditions, such as anemia or hyperthyroidism, may help with underlying heart murmurs. Each case is different, so your veterinarian will work with you to determine the best diagnostic and treatment plan while also discussing the prognosis for your cat. Close monitoring of heart murmurs and heart disease is necessary to check for progression of the condition. Management of CHF and congenital cardiac issues in cats is done with regular veterinary checkups every few months, bloodwork, and X-rays to monitor whether the cat is stable or if medications need to be added or adjusted. Prognosis ranges from excellent when discussing benign heart murmurs to grave when discussing severe congenital or acquired heart disease. Long-term prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause of the heart murmur and response to treatment. Focus is not placed on cure in most cases, rather it is placed on quality of life and comfort for your cat. No. Heart murmurs vary depending on grade (loudness), configuration (whether heard during contraction or relaxation of the heart), and location of the murmur. Prognosis depends on the cause of the heart murmur. It is typically excellent for benign murmurs, but prognosis is often grave when there is severe heart disease. Your cat’s long-term prognosis will also depend on their response to any treatment needed. “Innocent” or benign heart murmurs have no underlying heart disease causing the abnormal heart sounds. They are found often in cats of any age and are usually intermittent and quiet when listened to with a stethoscope. Innocent heart murmurs can only be confirmed via echocardiogram or ultrasound of the heart.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_pericarditis,Heart Sac Inflammation (Pericarditis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial If a cat's pericardium (the membranous sac surrounding the heart and roots of the vessels) becomes inflamed, it is a condition referred to as pericarditis. The pericardium is made up of two layers: a fibrous outer layer and a membranous inner layer that adheres closely to the heart. Within the sac is a layer of pericardial fluid made up of serum, a watery fluid that serves to keep the surfaces of the membranous sac and heart moist. The body's membranes will also secrete serum when they detect inflammation of the surrounding tissues and organs. When either of the layers of the pericardium becomes inflamed, the natural reaction is for the membranes to produce more serum, which leads to an excess of serum in the pericardium. The build-up of fluid compresses the heart, placing too much pressure on it, and on the surrounding tissue, typically leading to more inflammation and further swelling. Pericarditis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Right-sided congestive heart failure is the usual outcome of pericarditis. Other symptoms include: May be diagnosed as idiopathic or agnogenic (meaning that it is not related to anything in particular, and is of unknown cause). The only apparent problem may be that there is excess fluid buildup, with seemingly nothing else to explain the disease. Other common causes include: 1. Trauma 2. Bacterial infection: 3. Viral infection: 4. Fungalinfection: 5. Parasitic infection: 6. Protozoal infection Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel to look for an underlying cause, or systemic illness. If bacterial based pericarditis is suspected, your veterinarian will take a fluid sample of the pericardial effusion for aerobic and anaerobic culture. That is, examination of tissue that lives with oxygen, and tissue that lives without oxygen. Thoracic radiograph images (X-rays of the chest), and echocardiogram images are essential for an accurate visual diagnosis. Other, less sensitive tests which might still supply useful information about the heart are cardiac catheterization, where a tube is inserted into an artery or vein in the arm or leg, and then threaded up into the chambers of the heart; and electrocardiogram, which records the heart's electrical muscle activity. Both tests measure functionality: blood pressure and flow, rhythm, and how well the heart muscle is pumping. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the pericarditis. All cats with this disease will need to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Chemotherapy will be prescribed if there are cancerous neoplastic (abnormal tissue growth) conditions, and bacterial infections will be treated with the appropriate antibiotics. A pericardectomy surgery to remove part of the pericardium may also be necessary. This condition will sometimes reoccur. If signs of illness return at anytime after taking your cat home, call your veterinarian immediately for advisement. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_myocardial_tumors,Heart Tumors in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Myocardial tumors are rare types of tumors that affect the heart. When they do occur, they tend to occur in older animals. A myocardial tumor can take either of two forms: a benign tumor, which is a mass of tissue that does not metastasize; and a malignant tumor, which does metastasize throughout the body. A benign tumor might be categorized as a hemangioma – a harmless growth consisting mainly of newly formed blood or lymph vessels. Conversely, a malignant tumor might be categorized as a hemangiosarcoma - a are and abnormal, rapidly reproducing tissue growth that arises from the blood vessels in the heart. A tumor that arises from the fibrous tissue, like heart valve tissue, is referred to as a fibroma if it is benign, and a fibrosarcoma if it is malignant. There are also tumors that develop in the softer, connective tissue in the upper chambers of the heart (atria). Benign tumors of this sort are termed myxomas; myxosarcomas when they are malignant. One particular type of tumor that is always malignant is the rhabdomyosarcoma – a tumor that arises from the skeletal muscle in the heart. There are also tumors that can spread to the heart secondarily. Some tumors which do not arise in the heart, but which spread to it, are lymphomas - malignant tumors of the lymph nodes; neurofibromas - benign tumors of nerve fiber origin; granular cell tumors – of unknown origin, which can be malignant or benign; and osteosarcomas - malignant tumors that originate in the bone. Symptoms are dependent on what type of tumor is in the heart, and where in the heart it is located: The causes for myocardial tumors are still unknown. [ pageberak ] Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a baseline blood work profile. This will include a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Chest x-rays and ultrasound imaging will allow your veterinarian to visually examine the heart, so that a complete assessment can be made of the heart, and any masses that are present within it. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat). Your veterinarian may also need to take a surgical tissue sample of the mass for biopsy. Even if the mass in the heart is extensive, or has begun to spread through the body, surgical resection is still the recommended treatment of choice for most heart tumors. This holds even if the surgery will not cure the condition. But, if the tumor is benign, surgical resection may be curative. Chemotherapy can be administered in the case of malignant heart tumors, but unfortunately, in many cases patients will die in spite of treatment. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat in order to perform serial heart ultrasounds. These examinations will help your doctor to follow the progress of your cat's condition as well as to check the heart muscle for signs of doxorubicin toxicity – if doxorubicin has been prescribed as part of a chemotherapeutic program. Doxorubicin is an effective drug for treating malignant cancers, but one of the negative side effects is that it can damage heart muscle. Your veterinarian will also take chest x-rays at each visit to make sure the tumor has not spread. The final prognosis for most malignant myocardial tumors is guarded to poor.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_endocarditis_infective,Heart Valve Infection (Infective Endocarditis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Inflammation of the inner lining of the heart is medically referred to as endocarditis. Infective endocarditis can occur in response to any infection of the body. Generalized infections in the body may invade the inner lining of heart, as well as the valves of the heart. If the underlying disease if not treated in time, complications can lead to heart failure and death. This condition is rarely seen in cats. Variable set of symptoms may be present in patient depending upon the nature and site of infection, complications and extent of affects on heart. The following symptoms may be present in an affected cat: You will need to give your veterinarian a complete background history for your cat, including information about the onset of symptoms, any illnesses or injuries your cat has experienced, any surgical procedures, and the duration and frequency of symptoms that have been apparent. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination, including basic laboratory testing: a complete blood count (CBC) test, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The results of these tests may reveal information related to the underlying infection, and may point to the organs being affected. Blood cultures will help to determine the causative agent involved in the infection and will also allow your veterinarian to determine the most suitable antibiotics for treatment of the underlying infection. A visual examination of the heart, using radiographic (i.e., X-ray) studies can help your veterinarian to determine the extent of heart involvement, and echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to image the inner organs, is an excellent tool for a detailed evaluation of the heart's functioning ability. Your veterinarian will also need to measure the electrical activity of the heart, which is done using an electrocardiogram (ECG) to record the heart's movement and impulses. This is a serious health problem and your cat will most likely require immediate hospitalization for intensive care and treatment. Fluid therapy and antibiotic therapy will be started to maintain body fluid level and to control the infection, respectively. Patients with valve involvement generally do not have good prognosis. Treatment is usually continued for 12 weeks. During that time your veterinarian will take multiple blood samples at regular intervals to measure how much of the infection, if any, is still present. After antibiotic therapy has stopped, blood samples will be taken to confirm that the infection has been resolved. If your cat's heart problem was mild, it will usually respond well to treatment. If the endocarditis was diagnosed in time, and aggressive treatment was employed along with detailed follow up, the chances of a full recovery are greatly enhanced. You may need to take your cat to the veterinarian for weekly follow-up examinations, and to determine overall progress. Your veterinarian may also suggest a special diet for your cat to improve cardiovascular functioning and organ health. Treatment will be directed towards treating the underlying infection as well as the heart problems that have resulted from such infections. In cases where a diagnosis was not made early on, and the disease has had an opportunity to advance, the overall prognosis may be very poor due to further complications that are common in affected cats. In such a case, you will need to consult with your veterinarian on alternative plans. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrioventricular_valve_dysplasia,Heart Valve Malformation in Cats,"Heart valve malformation, also known as atrioventricular valve dysplasia , occurs when the atrioventricular valves are malformed and do not fully close. Instead of flowing only one way through the heart, blood backs up from the ventricle into the atria, and from there into either the lungs (mitral valve dysplasia) or the body (tricuspid valve dysplasia). If the condition is untreated, left-sided or right-sided congestive heart failure will develop. The feline heart is a muscle made up of four chambers ‑ two atrias and two ventricles. The atrias serve as receptacles for blood entering the heart, from the lungs on the left side, and the body on the right side. From there, blood is pumped into the ventricles and then either flows into the lungs from the right side to pick up oxygen or out from the left side to deliver oxygenated blood to the body. The atrioventricular valves ‑ mitral and tricuspid ‑ open and close between the atria and ventricles and direct the blood flow throughout the heart. Closure of these valves is audible and results in a “ lub-dub ” heard when listening with a stethoscope. The tricuspid valve, which contains three cusps, lies between the right atria and right ventricle. The mitral valve, which contains two cusps, is located between the left atria and left ventricle. If the valves are malformed and blood is no longer moving one way, the heart muscle must work harder to pump the same amount of blood out to either the lungs or the body. It will eventually bulk up, becoming enlarged either in size or thickness. Unfortunately, this process restricts the amount of blood pushed out due to a sheer decrease in volume. As the atria become enlarged stretching occurs, resulting in increased platelet activity and secondary blood clot formation which can have life-threatening consequences. Click here to download this medical illustration. Cats suffering from heart valve malformation often have these general symptoms: Failure to gain weight Loss of appetite Difficulty breathing Weakness Fainting spells Muscle wasting If the malformation is in the mitral valve, your cat may have the following specific symptoms associated with left-sided heart failure because fluid accumulates in the lung and chest cavity: Increased heart rate Difficulty breathing “Stretching” postures Cough Pale or blue gums Weak pulses, felt on the inside of the cat’s thighs Cool extremities If the malformation is in the tricuspid valve, your cat may have the following specific symptoms associated with right-sided heart failure: Ascites , or fluid buildup, in the abdomen Distension of the jugular veins Weakness or collapse Fluid accumulation in the lower limbs Enlarged liver Unfortunately, for some pet parents, the only sign will be the sudden passing of the cat, as cats with severe congenital heart defects are likely to die prematurely. Congenital heart defects are rare in cats. It is estimated that less than 1 percent of the population is affected, with males and purebred cats such as Maine Coons and Ragdolls having a higher incidence. Specifically, with atrioventricular valve dysplasia, the defects are present at birth and mostly involve some sort of developmental problem where the valves are thickened, shortened or attached to the wrong location of the heart. The chordae tendineae (cords of tissue that connect the valves to the heart muscle) may be thickened or elongated which affects the valve’s ability to function. For most cats, an audible murmur can be detected, usually during one of the first of several kitten wellness exams. Further testing is then recommended. Sometimes, the veterinarian can detect another heart sound or a “gallop” rhythm. Once detected, or if you have a cat predisposed to atrioventricular valve dysplasia, a thorough cardiac exam will be performed. This often will include: Diagnostic Imaging, such as chest X-rays and an ultrasound of the heart, referred to as an echocardiogram or EKG. It determines heart size, chamber thickness, pressures and valve function Blood pressure measurements Electrocardiogram Cardiac biomarker evaluation (NT-proBNP and cTnI), which can aid the veterinarian in detecting underlying heart disease Blood work and urine testing are often conducted (though the results are typically unhelpful) as a baseline to serve for medication monitoring, and the effects heart valve malformation may have on the organs. For some cats with mild atrioventricular valve dysplasia, follow-up and careful monitoring may be the recommended therapy. Most cases require some type of medical management. Cats are usually prescribed a combination of the following: Diuretics (water pills), to remove excess fluid from the blood Blood thinners, such as aspirin or Plavix, to reduce the formation of a blood clot ACE-inhibitors, such as Enalapril or Benazepril to reduce blood pressure and help reduce the heart’s workload Pimobendan, a drug that not only improves the effectiveness of the heart’s contraction, but also helps regulate heart rate Atenolol, a beta-blocker, that helps regulate blood pressure and heart rate Open-heart surgery to repair or replace the valve can be performed, although this is often limited and has been more widely used in the treatment of mitral regurgitation in dogs. Cats with mild heart defects may live for years without any clinical signs and may have a relatively normal life—or they may present with clinical signs of heart failure later in life. If the defect is severe, signs of heart failure and fatal arrhythmias may occur, and although the signs can be treated, the prognosis is often poor. Exercise restriction, nutritional management (often geared toward sodium reduction), and use of antibiotics when undergoing surgical procedures may also be recommended. Cats diagnosed with hyperthyroidism should be monitored and screened for the presence of structural heart disease. Cats that have been diagnosed with atrioventricular valve dysplasia and/or heart failure should have frequent checkups and blood work to ensure that the medications prescribed are not having negative effects on the kidneys. Depending on the severity on the defect, your cat may need chest X-rays every three to six months and echocardiograms every six to 12 months. Some cats can have a relatively normal life, while others will fail to survive into adulthood, depending on the severity of the malformation. Cats diagnosed with congestive heart failure have a poor prognosis, with an average survival of 3 months to 1.5 years. Cats can live with congenital heart disease, but for those whose disease is caught early will have a better quality of life because some diseases can be managed medically. Others, such as patent ductus arteriosus can be treated surgically. Tou S. P. Congenital and Inherited Disorders of the Cardiovascular System in Cats. Merck Veterinary Manual.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_atrioventricular_valvular_stenosis,Heart Valve Narrowing (Mitral and Tricuspid) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial There are four chambers in the heart. The top two chambers of the heart are the atria, and the bottom two chambers of the heart are the ventricles. The valves that communicate between the atria and ventricles are the atrioventricular valves. The mitral valve communicates between the left atrium and left ventricle, and the tricuspid valve communicates between the right atrium and the right ventricle. Abnormalities in the mitral valve, on the left, affect blood flow to the lungs. The tricuspid valve, on the right side of the heart, is responsible for blood flow to the body. Abnormalities seen here result in poor blood flow throughout the body. Stenosis (narrowing) of these valves can occur due to the valves being malformed from birth, bacterial heart muscle infection, cancer of the heart, or hyptertrophic cardiomyopathy (a disease often seen in cats suffering from a thyroid tumor). Stenosis of these valves causes the valves to become leaky, increasing the diastolic pressure gradient between the atrium and the ventricle (the pressure gradient is the period in which the heart's chambers dilate and fill with blood – diastole of the ventricles follows diastole of the atria). Mitral valve narrowing can cause high blood pressure in the lungs, trouble breathing, and coughing. Mitral valve stenosis is more commonly seen more in Siamese breeds. Tricuspid valve stenosis can lead to swelling of the legs and paws, and an enlarged liver may be seen on radiographis images. Both mitral and tricuspid valve stenosis can lead to congestive heart failure (CHF). Exercise intolerance Fainting (syncope) Trouble breathing Coughing (mitral valve narrowing) Pale or bluish skin color (cyanosis) Fluid in the abdomen, swelling (tricuspid valve stenosis) Stunted growth Spitting up blood There are a variety of causes that narrow a cat's heart valves, much of it depending on the type of valve stenosis. Mitral valve stenosis, for example, is congenital and commonly affects Siamese . Tricuspid valve stenosis, meanwhile, is also congenital in nature and may be due to cancer of the heart and bacterial infection of the heart muscle. Moreover, both of these are usually diagnossed at an early age. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms, including any information you have on your cat's family line. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. The results of these tests typically return normal levels. Based on the apparent symptoms and the results of the initial physical exam, your veterinarian should be able to narrow the cause down to which type of heart valve disease is present. This will need to be confirmed with further testing. For diagnostic purposes, your veterinarian will need to view the heart using imaging tools. X-rays can help your veterinarian to determine if there is enlargement of the valves or atrium on either side of the heart, and echocardiography will show atrial dilation, and possibly abnormal flow of the blood through the heart. Electrocardiograph readings can also help your doctor to determine if the heart's electrical functioning is being affected. An abnormal rhythm, and the exact measurement of the abnormality can be a great help in determining which side of the heart is most affected. Your doctor may also use a diagnostic method called angiography, which utilizes X-ray imaging along with a radio-opaque contrasting agent (dye) that is injected into the blood vessels. This dye makes it possible to visualize the vessels internally and evaluate the flow of blood through the heart and surrounding vessels. In rare instances, a veterinarian may also want to check for pressure disparities within the heart (intracardial) and within the vessels (intravascular) by catheterizing it, a process called cardiac catheterization. This method can also be used for injection of contrasting agents, to take a sample for biopsy, if cancer is suspected, and to assess the severity of the disease. Medicine is essential to treating heart valve disorders. Diuretics may be used to reduce fluid retention, but other drugs of choice will be based on the final diagnosis. While it is possible to surgically replace or repair damaged valves, it is expensive and has limited availability. An alternative treatment to surgery is a method called balloon valvuloplasty, which may be performed by a specialist after a referral from your veterinarian. Intensive care hospitalization will be necessary for medical treatment of your cat if it is suffering from congestive heart failure. Your cat will need to be rechecked about every three months or sooner to see if there are continuing signs of chronic heart failure and to adjust the treatment accordingly. Chest X-rays, an electrocardiogram (EKG – to measure the electrical activity of the heart) and echocardiography will very likely be performed at the follow-up appointments. Your veterinarian will discuss precautions and home treatment with you, but generally, cats that are diagnosed with AVD need to be restricted to a low-salt diet and exercise should be restricted. Because this is a genetically based disease, if your cat is diagnosed with it, your veterinarian will strongly advise against breeding your cat out. Spaying or neutering is indicated.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_heartworm_disease,"Heartworm Disease in Cats: Symptoms, Treatment, and Prevention","iStock/konradlew Heartworm disease is caused by a parasite, Dirofilaria immitis , which is spread by mosquitos. While cats are susceptible to heartworms, they are a fairly resistant, imperfect host—meaning they aren’t ideal for mosquitoes to feed on them. Cats acquire heartworm far less than dogs in the same geographic location, with only 5–20% affected . Only around 25% of heartworms reach adulthood in cats. Typically, cats also have a low worm burden (usually one to four worms compared to hundreds in dogs), and less than 20% of those worms will produce microfilaria, the infective form of heartworm. Cats also have higher rates of aberrant heartworm migration, which is when heartworms fail to migrate to the pulmonary arteries and instead travel to other body cavities, blood vessels, or the central nervous system. Click here to download this medical illustration. The life cycle of heartworms is complex and involves many larval, or immature phases: First, a mosquito acquires microfilaria when it bites a dog infected with heartworm disease. Once ingested by a mosquito, the microfilaria will molt, or transform, over the next 10–14 days into three different forms of larva: L1, L2, and L3. After the third molt, the L3 larva can now infect new dogs and cats. The mosquito bites a cat and transfers the infective L3 through saliva into the bite wound. The L3 stays within the cat’s tissues for 3–4 days until it molts again to L4. L4 remains in the tissues for approximately two months. Finally, L4 molts to L5, the immature adult, which leaves the tissues via the bloodstream. L5 lands in the pulmonary arteries—the vessels responsible for bringing oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs to re-oxygenate. L5 continues to develop in the pulmonary artery for another 4–6 months until, finally, it becomes an adult heartworm. The adult is capable, in some worms, of releasing microfilaria into the bloodstream to start the cycle all over again. The American Heartworm Society divides heartworm disease in cats into two stages: Stage 1 occurs when immature L5 worms arrive in the pulmonary arteries, many of them dying. This causes a severe, acute inflammatory reaction (often misdiagnosed as asthma or other respiratory diseases) as the vessels and heart respond to the parasite. Veterinarians and researchers call this acute inflammatory process heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD). As the living worms mature, the inflammatory response lessens, in part from the adult worms actively suppressing the immune system. Stage 2 occurs when adult heartworms die, invoking a highly inflammatory, anaphylactic, and often fatal response. The dead worms start off a strong pulmonary inflammatory cascade, and a cat’s blood vessels are small and narrow. When an adult heartworm dies, it easily causes an embolism. A cat who survives adult heartworm death will have permanent lung damage and chronic respiratory disease. For PetMD's complete guide on heartworm disease in cats, click here .

Clinical signs of heartworm disease vary greatly in severity. Some cats may not have any clinical signs at all. Most of the noticeable issues come from the adult heartworm suddenly dying and causing acute issues within the cat or abnormal worm migration causing tissue damage. When cats do show signs of illness, veterinarians most commonly see the following: Lethargy Coughing Decreased appetite Weight loss Exercise intolerance Vomiting Difficulty breathing Increased breathing Open-mouth breathing Neurologic abnormalities—difficulty walking, (ataxia), and possible seizures Heart murmur Sudden death The parasite Dirofilaria immitis is the cause of heartworm disease. It is transmitted by mosquitos. Click here to download this medical illustration. Warm areas, especially in the southern United States, allow efficient mosquito reproduction and, therefore, southern states have a higher percentage of heartworm in cats. Outdoor cats are more susceptible, but even indoor cats can acquire heartworm if a mosquito ventures inside. Heartworm disease in cats is often difficult to diagnose, especially compared to dogs. This is due to a range of testing factors including: Tests for microfilaria may give frequent false negatives, since cats rarely have circulating microfilaria. Antibody blood tests can detect immature infections early, even two months after infection. However, a positive result does not confirm an adult infection, and it can even remain positive after cats clear the infection. Antigen blood tests are the gold standard of diagnosing dogs with heartworm disease but can only test for the presence of female heartworms. Because cats can have very low and single-sex (i.e. all male) worm burdens, this method of testing will also miss some feline infections. Chest radiographs (X-rays) may help in diagnosing cases of feline heartworm disease because enlargement of pulmonary arteries and changes to the lung tissue are suggestive of heartworm disease. Common features of heartworms can be seen on X-rays in about half of cases. Echocardiography (ultrasound) of the heart is useful to visualize the actual live worms in the pulmonary artery and right side of the heart. It can also help determine if pulmonary pressures are abnormal while excluding or confirming cardiac disease. Positive blood tests, enlarged arteries on radiographs, and changes in the heart increase the level of suspicion of a heartworm infection. While no test is perfect, your vet will use physical exam findings in addition to multiple types of tests to determine the severity of heartworm disease in your cat. Treating heartworm disease in cats is difficult. Many common therapies—including the most common canine treatment, merbromin—are toxic to cats. Merbromin, otherwise known as Immiticide, is used to kill adult heartworms in dogs but its use in cats has been associated with serious side effects that occur from worm death. The American Heartworm Society , the leading expert for care of heartworm-infected pets, does not currently recommend using therapies that kill adult heartworms in cats. Cats who currently do not show any clinical signs may have the option of being monitored over time for a spontaneous cure . A spontaneous cure happens when the cat’s immune system naturally clears the heartworm infection without causing any problems and without treatment. When it comes to medications to treat heartworm disease in cats, your vet may recommend: Ivermectin —a medication that can reduce worm loads when given over a long period of time (two years or more). Allergic shock or an inflammatory reaction are two side effects of this medication in cats. Ivermectin is a common ingredient in heartworm prevention medication. Prednisolone —a steroid that can decrease a cat’s strong inflammatory response, this medication is prescribed for those that have clinical signs such as coughing or evidence of lung disease on an X-ray. It helps to diminish the breathing issues associated with heartworm positive cats. Doxycycline —an antibiotic that helps to remove the bacteria that lives inside heartworms and increases inflammation in cats. Other medications such as terbutaline , theophylline , or albuterol may also be recommended to help with respiratory distress. Because of the difficulty with medical management of heartworm disease in cats, the preferred method of treatment is to remove heartworms through surgery. An invasive surgery can remove worms after entering the chest cavity and using forceps to directly remove the worms through the heart. However, all forms of surgery for heartworm in cats can lead to circulatory collapse and sadly death. That’s why prevention is key to helping your cat stay safe and protected from heartworms in the first place. All heartworm-positive cats should have serologic testing, echocardiograms, and chest radiographs performed every six to 12 months to monitor their heartworm status, whether they were treated or were asymptomatic. Ideally, veterinarians will perform both antibody and antigen tests to gather the most information. Veterinarians will cautiously declare a cat “recovered” from heartworm disease once blood tests are negative in addition to resolution of clinical and radiological signs. Without medication therapy or surgery, there is no cure for heartworm disease in cats. The goal is to keep the cat symptom free for as long as possible hoping that the cat outlives the worms. The median survival time for cats with heartworm disease is an average of one and a half to four years . Managing heartworm-positive cats for success involves close monitoring, in-depth discussions with veterinarians, and full understanding of the risks of heartworm in cats. Heartworm is a scary but preventable disease. Fortunately, there are plenty of heartworm medications for cats available on the market. In addition to preventing heartworm, many of these preventative medications also help to prevent intestinal worms, fleas, and tick activity. Kittens can start preventatives around 8 weeks of age and continue their entire lives. A common misconception is that indoor cats don’t need heartworm prevention because they are indoors but think how often you are bitten in your own house. Mosquitoes can still make their way inside and find your cat just as easily. Some common heartworm medications you can discuss with your vet include: The median survival time for cats at the time of diagnosis is four years. Some cats are asymptomatic, but the most common first signs are lethargy, coughing, and vomiting. Heartworm in cats can be fatal and unpredictable. Heartworm is not transmissible from one cat to another without an intermediate vector, such as a mosquito. 1. Atkins CE. Feline Heartworm Disease: What’s New-2008 .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/systemic/heatstroke-cats,"Heatstroke in Cats: Signs, Treatment, and Prevention","Miguel Angel Flores/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Heatstroke in cats is when a cat’s body temperature surpasses 104 F. When this occurs, there’s a significant release of inflammation throughout their body. Inflammation caused by heatstroke sets off several reactions that affects every major system of the body, causing the breakdown of essential proteins and enzymes. This puts the cat at risk of organ failure and potentially death. If your cat is experiencing heatstroke, contact a veterinarian immediately. Heat exhaustion is an early stage of heatstroke, when the cat’s temperature is approximately 103–104 F. Recognizing the signs of heat exhaustion and acting quickly can prevent heatstroke in cats and tissue damage. During heat exhaustion, a cat may: Seek a cooler area, such as a tile floor or a shady spot Pant Start to drool Develop sweaty paws Drink more Groom themselves to cool off If you notice any of these signs, immediately do the following: Move your cat to a cool, air-conditioned area. Place a slightly cool, damp towel on your cat’s back. If your cat allows, place a damp towel under their belly. Rubbing cool water on the paw pads and ears will also help with cooling. Offer your kitty cool water to drink ; some cats may like ice cubes. It's important to start brief cooling at home (such as applying cool damp towels and water to the ears and paws), but head directly to a veterinarian for emergency care. Signs of heatstroke in cats include: Rectal temperature greater than 104 F Disorientation Reddened gums Vomiting , which may contain blood Diarrhea , which may contain blood Pinpoint spots of bleeding on the skin, whites of the eyes, gums, inside of the ears, and belly (petechiae) Labored breathing and wheezing Panting Seizures Collapse Inability to walk or stand up Heatstroke in cats is most common in: Cats allowed outside , especially on very hot days, very humid days, or when there is little shade or water available Indoor cats let outside into hot temperatures when they are not used to the heat Indoor cats when there is no power or air conditioning in the home Brachycephalic (flat-faced) cats , on any warm day Obese cats Senior cats Kittens that are 4 months of age or younger Cats with underlying health issues such as kidney disease , diabetes mellitus , or mobility issues that hinder their access to water Cats with heart, respiratory, or neurological conditions (such as seizures) Cats inadvertently trapped in a running clothes dryer Cats unintentionally confined in a car (even on mild days, the interior of a car can quickly become dangerously hot ) The diagnosis of heatstroke in cats primarily relies on both the cat’s history and a physical examination . The veterinary team will immediately take blood samples as well as start pulse oximetry to determine the oxygen saturation of the blood and start an electrocardiogram (ECG) to monitor the heart. In most cases, supplementary oxygen will be needed. Lab tests are used to check for any major and minor infection in the blood throughout the cat’s stay, including kidney and liver injury . The veterinary team will pay close attention to the cat’s body temperature, because once cooling efforts start, they do not want the body temperature to drop too low . The first step in treating heatstroke in cats is to bring their body temperature back to a more normal range. This is primarily achieved through intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. Your vet will pay close attention to how alert the cat is upon arrival for treatment and whether your cat becomes more alert as the treatment progresses. Cooling of the ears, feet, and belly with room temperature water may also continue in the hospital, depending on the cat’s temperature when they arrive. Heatstroke patients often experience low blood sugar. The addition of glucose to their IV fluids over several days will prevent seizures or other side effects of having low blood sugar. Throughout the hospital stay, lab tests will be used to screen for kidney and liver injury. Heatstroke can lead to a breakdown of the lining of the blood vessels, causing a greater risk of bleeding. If this occurs, the cat may benefit from one or more plasma transfusions. Cats that become comatose may have cerebral edema, or brain swelling . This may be treated with mannitol, a diuretic IV medication. Cats with heatstroke are also more susceptible to sepsis (severe infection throughout the entire body) , so antibiotics (such as ampicillin and Clavamox ) are often used. Cats that are having difficulty breathing may receive supplementary oxygen by remaining in an oxygen cage. Some cats that are in severe respiratory distress may need to be intubated and ventilated to help them breathe. Kidney failure from heatstroke is possible. If this is the case, fluid therapy is essential but must be carefully monitored. In either of these cases, the veterinarian may recommend referral to a veterinary hospital where a ventilator or kidney dialysis is available. In mild to moderate cases of heatstroke in cats, pets often make a full recovery by the time they are discharged from the hospital. Medications to take home may include antibiotics such as Clavamox and gastrointestinal protectants, like sucralfate or omperazole . Your veterinarian may want to see your cat back in five to 10 days. This is so that they can perform a recheck examination and lab tests to assess your cat’s organ function, and sooner if your cat experiences vomiting, diarrhea, or disorientation. Your cat will need ample rest once she is home. Improvement should be noted within the next several days. Your cat may need to return to the vet for follow-up blood work in three days to verify if there are any lingering kidney or liver effects. In very severe cases of heatstroke, the prognosis is poor. You can ask your veterinarian about the expected long-term care for your cat, as some pets with severe heatstroke may require long-term treatment for kidney failure, heart disease, or neurological problems . Keep in mind that cats that have had heatstroke are more sensitive to a recurrence in the future. Cats should be kept indoors and protected from heat. To prevent heatstroke in cats, take the following precautions: Always keep your cat indoors to protect them from predators, heat, and parasites Do not let cats out on a catio on hot or humid days Before using your clothes dryer, always check for the presence of a cat to prevent accidental entrapment, and keep it closed in between use. Place a bag or purse on or next to the cat carrier to ensure you don’t accidentally leave your cat in the car. Install a Wi-Fi thermostat in your home to receive alerts if the power goes out, so you can get your cat to a cooler place if you are not home. Give cats with seizures their medications regularly, as missed doses can trigger episodes. If your cat is seeking a cooler area to lie down, is panting, seems uncoordinated, sluggish or having changes in its behavior, then your cat is probably too hot. Additionally, other signs that your cat is too hot is trouble breathing, vomiting or diarrhea, either of which can be accompanied by blood. Depending on the severity of heatstroke when first evaluated, some cats can recover without major long-term complications; others, unfortunately, may develop kidney or liver failure. These cats can have complications associated with heatstroke side effects. This includes bone marrow dysfunction, neurologic issues, and clotting disorders. If caught early enough, cats can recover from heat exhaustion. If your cat is overheating, move her into the shade or a cooler environment away from sunlight and provide fans or proper ventilation. As cats can die from the heat, have your pet evaluated by a veterinarian right away. Allen, S. Disorders of Heat and Cold . Clinical Small Animal Internal Medicine. Wiley Global Research. 2020.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hemoglobinuria_myoglobinuria,Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Urine in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hemoglobin serves to carry oxygen to the tissues, and also carries the pigment that causes the blood to appear red. The destruction of blood cells within the blood vessels frees hemoglobin into the blood plasma (the yellowish colored liquid matter of the blood), where it binds with haptoglobin, a blood plasma protein which functions for the purpose of binding with free hemoglobin in order to prevent loss of iron. However, when all of the haptoglobin is used up, hemoglobin spills over into the blood, binding reversibly to blood proteins, and changing the color of the plasma from a faint yellow to pink. The unbound hemoglobin is then cleared through the kidneys. Myoglobin serves the same purpose as hemoglobin but is particular to the muscles, and is differentiated by the amount of oxygen and carbon monoxide it delivers to the tissues (more, and less, respectively). Muscle damage releases myoglobin into the blood plasma, but it does not bind to serum proteins. Consequently, plasma color does not change, and the myoglobin is quickly cleared from the blood by the liver and kidneys. If there is too much hemoglobin and myoglobin in the blood plasma, these proteins will no longer be reabsorbed in the kidneys, and will instead spill over into the urine. Not only can hemoglobin and myoglobin damage the kidneys, but their presence in the blood indicates low oxygen-carrying capacity, which can result in liver damage, serious illness, and shock, all of which serve to further decrease the amount of oxygen available through the muscles and blood. In addition, the destruction of red blood cells inside the blood vessels, along with severe muscle damage, can bring about disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), an often fatal blood clotting disease. Some of the possible causes for hemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria are listed here. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and recent activities. A complete blood chemical profile will be conducted. This will include a complete blood count, and a test to measure for toxic levels of copper and zinc concentrations. Your doctor will also probably take a blood smear to look for irregularities of the red blood cells, and may also use the ammonium sulfate test to detect hemoglobin or myoglobin presence in the blood. A urinalysis to look for bilirubin in the urine is another test that will be necessary for pinpointing the exact cause of the condition. Bilirubin is a red-yellow bile pigment that comes from the degradation of the red pigment (heme) in hemoglobin; too much bilirubin cannot be processed by the liver and will spill over into the urine. Excess bilirubin in the blood is also the cause of yellowing of the skin and eyes. Radiographs and ultrasounds are useful for visualizing the liver in case of copper-associated liver disease, or to reveal swallowed coins or cage bolts/nuts – both common sources of zinc or copper poisoning. Medications prescribed will depend upon your veterinarian’s final diagnosis of what is underlying the symptoms. If the condition is severe, your cat will be hospitalized for stabilization and fluid rehydration. Your veterinarian will advise you on when you will need to return with your cat for follow-up appointments. There may be further need for a blood chemistry profile, a complete blood count, urinalysis, packed cell volume (PCV) test, and an arterial blood gas analysis. Genetic diseases are generally incurable, but can sometimes be managed by taking certain precautions with the animal. For example, neonatal isoerythrolysis, a congenital condition which results in the destruction of red blood cells, can be prevented by not allowing kittens with type A or AB blood to nurse from a type B queen (mother).

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_pulmonary_contusions,Hemorrhage of the Lung in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pulmonary contusion, or a hemorrhage of the lung, occurs when the cat's lung is torn and/or crushed during direct trauma to the chest. This then impedes the cat's ability to breath and pass arterial blood to a capillary bed in synchrony. Cats suffering from capillary damage may also develop pulmonary fluid in the lungs, as well as hemorrhage. Pulmonary contusion occurs in both dogs and cats and there is no specific breed, age, or gender predilection. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated/preceded this condition. Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including blood tests, a urinalysis, and chest X-rays. If there are rib fractures, for example, they will show up on X-ray. Your doctor will also perform coagulation (clotting) tests, and may culture cells from the trachea. Your pet will probably need to be hospitalized so that respiratory function can be supported, and the cardiovascular system can be stabilized. A hospital stay may be recommended so that the cat may be resuscitated quickly if complications should arise. Your veterinarian will want to look at other organ systems to be sure there are no other internal injuries. Activity will be restricted for a time, and respiratory functions will be carefully monitored for 24 hours after the trauma. If shock sets in, it may be necessary to administer fluids intravenously to support the cat's cardiovascular function, and in some cases, blood plasma transfusion might also be called for. Nutritional support will be given by intravenous fluid, if necessary. Prescribed medications, meanwhile, will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of the symptoms. Initially, your veterinarian will want to frequently monitor respiratory rate and effort, mucous membrane color, heart rate, pulse quality, and lung sounds. There may also be a need for further blood tests and urinalyses, to monitor your cat’s systemic reaction to the trauma. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/hepatic-lipidosis-cats-fatty-liver-disease,Hepatic Lipidosis in Cats (Fatty Liver Disease),"Hepatic lipidosis is a common cause of liver failure in cats. Any cat can develop the condition, but it is most commonly seen in middle-aged cats who are (or were) overweight and haven’t been eating much recently. When cats don’t eat, they can lose weight quickly. As a result, large amounts of fat get sent to the liver and end up inside liver cells—sometimes so much fat that the cells can no longer function normally. This is hepatic lipidosis, which is sometimes also called fatty liver disease. When cats stop eating, hepatic lipidosis can start developing within just a few days. Don’t let your cat go without food for more than a day or two before you call your veterinarian for advice. Aggressive treatment is usually needed to reverse hepatic lipidosis, but there is good news: As long as they get the treatment they need, as many as 90% of cats with the condition can be expected to survive. Cats with hepatic lipidosis usually have some combination of the following symptoms: Poor or no appetite Rapid weight loss Jaundice (icterus)—a yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes and other tissues Vomiting Lethargy and depression Unusual behaviors Weakness Diarrhea or constipation Dark urine Abnormal bleeding or bruising Anything that stops a cat from eating can lead to hepatic lipidosis. Some common causes include: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) : Infiltration of inflammatory cells into the wall of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, poor appetite, and weight loss. Cholangiohepatitis and other types of liver disease: Poor appetite, weight loss, and vomiting are common symptoms with almost any type of liver disease. Cancer: Cancer anywhere in the body can trigger cats to eat poorly and lose weight. Pancreatitis : Inflammation of the pancreas is painful and often leads to decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Environmental changes: Cats are creatures of habit. Sometimes disrupting their normal routine, such as moving to a new home or adding a new family member, is all that is needed to make them stop eating. Cats that get lost or trapped somewhere without food may also starve and develop hepatic lipidosis. When an underlying cause can’t be identified, a cat will be diagnosed with idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. A veterinarian may suspect that a cat has hepatic lipidosis after learning they haven’t been eating much and they’ve recently lost a lot of weight. A physical exam can also provide evidence, but diagnostic testing is necessary to differentiate hepatic lipidosis from other diseases that have similar clinical signs. Veterinarians will usually start with a basic panel of bloodwork and a urinalysis. Many cats with hepatic lipidosis will have high levels of bilirubin and very high levels of alkaline phosphatase (a type of liver enzyme) in their blood. When a cat has hepatic lipidosis, an abdominal ultrasound should reveal that the whole liver looks abnormal, rather than just a specific part. During the ultrasound, the veterinarian can use a needle to remove a small sample of liver cells. If they’re filled with fat, the diagnosis is confirmed. Additional testing may also be necessary, both to identify hepatic lipidosis and to look for the health problems that may have led to it. At first glance, treatment for hepatic lipidosis seems simple. Get the cat to eat! But in reality, this is much harder than it sounds. Poor liver function makes a cat feel really bad. As a result, they don’t eat, which makes their liver function even worse … and so the cycle continues. Force-feeding a cat who is nauseated usually backfires. They tend to “blame” the food for how bad they feel and can quickly develop an aversion to eating anything at all. Because we need to get food into a cat with hepatic lipidosis quickly, a feeding tube is usually the best option. Nasogastric tubes (small tubes placed through the nose into the stomach) can work for a few days, but many cats with hepatic lipidosis require a month or two of tube-feeding. A better long-term solution is an esophagostomy tube. A veterinarian will briefly anesthetize your cat and place the tube into the esophagus through an incision through the skin of your cat’s neck. The tube is then sutured in place so that pet parents can use it for long-term feeding. Other types of feeding tubes may also be considered, based on the specifics of the case. Next, cats need to be gradually reintroduced to food. Giving too much food too quickly can lead to refeeding syndrome—a potentially fatal shift of fluids and electrolytes within the body. A schedule to prevent refeeding syndrome often looks something like this: Day 1 – feed 25% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals Day 2 – feed 50% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals Day 3 – feed 75% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals Day 4 – feed 100% of the cat’s caloric needs divided into 4-6 meals Cats with hepatic lipidosis may also require treatment with B vitamins, vitamin K, and vitamin E. Fluid therapy with added magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium may be necessary as well. To support the liver, veterinarians often prescribe nutritional supplements and medications like S-adenosylmethionine , L-carnitine, milk thistle, silybin, and ursodiol . Additional treatments will be based on a cat’s symptoms and underlying health problems. Cats will usually be hospitalized at the beginning of treatment so that veterinary staff can closely monitor their condition and adjust their treatment as needed. But once they are stable, cats can continue their recovery at home. If your cat has a feeding tube, your veterinarian will provide you with all the training you need to feed your cat, give medications, and maintain the tube. Tube feedings typically continue for a month or two. Once a cat is no longer nauseated and has started regaining weight, it’s time to start offering them food by mouth. Your veterinarian will likely recommend gradually reducing the amount of food you provide through the tube to give your cat a chance to get hungry. The feeding tube can be removed once a cat is eating completely on their own. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your cat’s health or treatment plan. A full recovery from hepatic lipidosis is definitely possible, so don’t give up even if it takes a while. The prognosis for a cat with hepatic lipidosis depends on the treatment they receive and any underlying health problems they might have. With aggressive treatment, the survival rate for cats with hepatic lipidosis can reach 90%, but this may be lower if hepatic lipidosis is caused by another disease that is difficult to treat. Cats with hepatic lipidosis are often prescribed canned foods that are high in protein and low in carbohydrates. Diets that are designed to help cats recover from serious illness, like Hill’s prescription diet a/d , or that manage diabetes , like Purina® Pro Plan® Veterinary Diets DM , often work well for hepatic lipidosis, but other liver problems may respond better to different diets. A veterinarian who is familiar with your cat’s case can help you pick out several good options. Any condition that damages a cat’s liver cells (hepatocytes) can lead to high liver enzymes on a panel of bloodwork. Possibilities include hepatic lipidosis, cholangiohepatitis, cancer, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) , exposure to certain drugs or toxins, infections, parasites, portosystemic shunts (PSS), trauma, diabetes , hyperthyroidism , pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or congestive heart failure . Sometimes diseases that have nothing to do with the liver can lead to similar changes in bloodwork.

This generalized muscle disorder is primarily seen in newborn cats or those less than one year old. Domestic short-haired and Devon Rex cats are also more prone to this form of muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin deficiency due to inherited defect. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then conduct a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Creatine kinase enzyme levels may be elevated due to the dystrophin deficiency. Liver enzymes are also elevated in cats with this disorder. The most hopeful test for reaching a definitive diagnosis, however, involves taking a muscle biopsy. The muscle tissue sample is sent to a veterinary pathologist to verify abnormal levels of dystrophin. No treatment is proven to be effective. Glucocorticosteriods are often given to cats suffering from non-inflammatory muscular dystrophy, but their effectiveness is variable and their exact mode of action in this disease is still unknown. Cats with this disorder are prone to aspiration pneumonia or cardiac disease and must evaluated at regular intervals for such complications. Be vigilant of complications and contact your veterinarian should problems arise. Unfortunately, the overall prognosis is very poor in cats with non-inflammatory muscular dystrophy. Often, your veterinarian will discourage breeding the animal, due to the genetic nature of the disorder. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_peritoneopericardial_diaphragmatic_hernia,Hernia Between the Pericardium and Peritoneum in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia is a congenital defect that affects the communication between the peritoneum (membrane that forms the lining of abdominal cavity) and pericardium (double-wall sac containing the heart). Like other hernias, the protrusion of the septum affects the surrounding area -- in this case, the abdomen. Symptoms will largely depend on the amount on the amount and nature of abdominal contents herniated. Some common ones include: Peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia occurs at the embryologic stage, and is considered a prenatal defect. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are typically normal. Abnormalities visible on X-rays ultimately depend on size and amount of herniated abdominal contents. More advanced techniques, like contrast peritoneography, are also used for a more detailed evaluation, whereby contrast medium (chemical) is given by injection into the peritoneal cavity and then X-rayed at different angles. Another technique commonly employed for confirmation of diagnosis is echocardiography. Surgery is typically required to close the hernia and place the viable organs to their normal location. However, if found in adult cats displaying no adverse symptoms, no treatment is required. Prognosis is good for cats that have undergone surgery with no other complicating factors.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_hiatal_hernia,Hernia (Hiatal) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A hernia occurs when one part of the body protrudes through a gap or opening into another part of the body. For example, a hiatal hernia takes place at the opening of the diaphragm where the food pipe joins the stomach. Part of the stomach pushes through the opening, and a hernia is formed. It is most likely to occur before a kitten has reached the first year, and is usually inherited (congenital). However, trauma may bring on an acquired hiatal hernia, and this can occur at any age. X-rays may show soft-tissue density in the region of the esophageal opening (hiatus), but they may not reveal lesions. However, an enlarged esophagus can be detected by X-ray. Contrast exams can show the esophagus as it is joined to the stomach and may reveal any abnormalities that are causing the problems. An exam called the esophagoscopy will use a scope to detect inflammation and might possibly show the end (terminal) of the esophagus sliding into the thorax. Diagnosis of hiatal hernia is based on examination and observation of one or more of the following manifestations of the condition: Not all hiatal hernias require treatment. Conservative therapy may be successful in controlling symptoms, and feeding small but frequent portions of a low-fat diet may control symptoms. Your veterinarian can prescribe drugs that will promote digestion and increase the tone of the sphincter in the lower esophagus. Medications such as cimetidine will decrease the acidity of the reflux, and promote healing of the damaged esophageal tissue. However, surgical treatment will be necessary if your surgeon finds that your cat needs the opening (hiatus) to be closed, or to have its stomach attached to the abdominal wall so that it does not protrude further. If your cat develops aspiration pneumonia, antibiotics may be necessary, as well as other kinds of therapeutic breathing treatments. If your cat requires surgery, you will need to follow through with return visits to your veterinarian for after care treatment. This is also true if you are managing the hiatal hernia from home. Aspiration pneumonia is one of the possible long term complications related to a hiatal hernia, so you will need to be watchful for signs of this. If you do detect symptoms of pneumonia, you will need to take your cat to the veterinarian immediately for treatment, as complications can quickly progress, possibly with a fatal outcome. Even with prompt treatment, some cats may have a recurrence of all of the symptoms, forcing you and your doctor to return to square one so that other causes can be settled upon and a treatment plan put into place.

https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_dg_canine_herpesvirus_infection,Herpesvirus in Dog Pups,"PetMD Editorial This infection is a systemic, usually fatal disease in young pups caused by the canine herpesvirus (CHV). Found worldwide, CHV especially causes high mortality rates in pups (two to three weeks old) due to their immature immune systems and poor temperature regulation. In fact, it rarely affects dogs older than three to four weeks. Although any breed can be affected, purebred dogs are more prone, as are young pregnant females and their pups. Herpesvirus infections are also a leading cause of fetal death and spontaneous abortion. The following signs should be taken seriously, as the onset of symptoms is sudden and death can occur just 12 to 36 hours afterward: This infection is caused by the canine herpesvirus (CHV). You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health to your veterinarian, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis -- the results of which are typically within normal ranges. In some dogs, however, a decreased number of platelet cells (which are responsible blood clotting) may be observed. Otherwise, your veterinarian will attempt to isolate the causative virus by conducting cell cultures or frozen tissue examinations. Typically, treatment is not recommended in pups with this form of herpesvirus infection, as antiviral therapy is ineffective. Instead, preventative measures are often the only recourse. A serum removed from bitches that have recovered from CHV infection, which contain protective antibodies, will be injected into pups before the illness' onset. Pups that survive from CHV infection may suffer from blindness, deafness, kidney damage, and nervous systems, while the bitches often give birth to future healthy litters. And although there is a CHV vaccine available in Europe for pregnant bitches that are at high risk, the effectiveness of the vaccine has not yet been proven. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_pulmonary_hypertension,High Blood Pressure in the Lungs in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Pulmonary hypertension in cats occurs when pulmonary arteries/capillaries vasoconstrict (narrow), are obstructed, or receive excessive blood flow. Where pulmonary refers to the lungs and their immediate environs. The capillaries of the lungs are very tiny branches of blood vessels only one cell in thickness, connecting the smallest veins to the smallest arteries for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide to the blood and tissues. Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, so high blood pressure in the left atrium of the heart can also cause elevated pressure in the capillaries of the lungs. High pulmonary blood pressure is dangerous because it can alter the shape and performance of the heart. The right ventricle is enlarged, while the left ventricle fills abnormally. Less oxygenated blood reaches the body, leading to troubled breathing, exercise intolerance, and blue-purple tinged skin. Eventually, this increased blood pressure in the right heart can lead to the pooling of blood in the body. The tricuspid valve can also be affected. Located in the right side of the heart, separating the right atrium (upper chamber) from the right ventricle (lower chamber), the tricuspid valve consists of three flaps of tissue that prevent blood from flowing back into the atrium from the ventricle. High pulmonary blood pressure can bring about abnormal functioning of the tricuspid valves, causing a back-flow of blood from the right ventricle back into the right atrium, eventually leading to right-sided congestive heart failure. Pulmonary hypertension in humans is typically due to an abnormal congenitally formed arrangement of the blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary vasculature), but with cats, the current medical findings show that they only develop secondary pulmonary hypertension, that is, hypertension in the lungs due to an underlying disease. Pulmonary (lung) disease Extrapulmonary causes of chronic hypoxia (inadequate levels of oxygen reaching the lung tissues) Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. In order to find the underlying cause for the pulmonary disorder, your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) test, to measure the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as to measure the capability of the lungs to move oxygen into the blood. If there is any fluid that has escaped from the vessels into the lining of the lungs (pleura) or abdomen (referred to as effusion), your veterinarian will take a sample for laboratory analysis. If a blood clot in the lung is suspected ( pulmonary thrombosis ), your veterinarian may perform several more blood tests to confirm this. A comprehensive examination of the thorax, the cavity where the lungs reside, is essential for diagnosis. Thoracic radiography, or x-ray imaging, is an essential diagnostic tool for your veterinarian to visualize pulmonary abnormalities and/or heart disease. Likewise, an echocardiogram (using Doppler) is a more sensitive tool for finding heart abnormalities, pulmonary blood clots, and measuring pressure gradients in blood vessels when the heart is contracting. Your veterinarian may also use an electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) to evaluate the electrical functioning of the heart. Recordings from this test would allow your doctor to make a diagnosis based on any observed abnormalities, if they exist, indicating lack of oxygen to the heart muscle. If your cat is showing signs of severe breathing problems it will be hospitalized and placed in an oxygen cage until its breathing has stabilized. Medicines will be prescribed by your veterinarian in accordance with the underlying disease diagnosis. If the finding is severe heartworm infestation, surgery may be performed to resolve the condition. Many times the prognosis for secondary pulmonary hypertension is guarded at best. If the disease cannot be resolved, treatment can serve to make your cat more comfortable, but it is not curative. If heart failure is diagnosed, your veterinarian will probably prescribe a restricted sodium diet for your cat. Otherwise, to encourage the best conditions for your cat, try to avoid environments that may place undue physical pressure on the cat, such as excessively cold or dry air, excessive heat, second-hand smoke, and high altitudes.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_portal_hypertension,High Blood Pressure in the Portal Vein to the Liver in Cats,"PetMD Editorial When ingested food enters into the intestinal tract, the nutrients and toxins that are a part of the food that has been ingested are released into the digestive blood stream. Before this blood can flow into the systemic blood stream, it must first go through a filtering and detoxification process. The filtering process is carried out mainly by the liver, which detoxifies the blood and sends it out into the main circulatory system. The portal vein, the main part of the hepatic portal system, carries this deoxygenated, prefiltered blood from the digestive tract and its related organs (i.e., the spleen, pancreas and gallbladder) to the liver for processing. When blood pressure in the portal vein reaches a level that is greater than 13 H2O, or 10 mm Hg, this is referred to as portal hypertension. The two main causes of portal hypertension are increased portal flow, or increased resistance to blood. Increased portal flow occurs when the portal veins attach to arteries, as they do in an arteriovenous fistula (where a new passage is formed between a vein and an artery), or it can occur as a result of blood being diverted (shunted) from the arteries to the liver. Increased resistance to blood can occur in the portal vein prior to its entry into the liver (prehepatic); in the portal vein inside the liver (hepatic); or, it can occur in the hepatic veins in the inferior vena cava (the largest vein in the body, which feeds blood from the lower body to the heart), after blood has exited the liver (posthepatic). Whether due to increased portal blood flow, or to increased resistance to blood, portal hypertension can cause the formation of multiple portosystemic shunts (PSS), a condition in which the circulatory system bypasses the liver. Cats with portal hypertension can also develop increased abdominal lymph production, leading to fluid build-up in the abdomen. Even more critical is the development of hepatic encephalopathy, which manifests as seizures and problems with mobility due to the unfiltered toxins being delivered to the brain through the bloodstream. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Other important tests that your veterinarian will order are tests for total serum bile acids, blood ammonia levels, and a sampling of abdominal fluids. Testing the abdominal fluid is essential for determining where the cause of the portal hypertension is originating. Internal imaging will also be a part of the diagnostic procedures. Results of chest x-rays may show that it is a heart disorder causing the portal hypertension, while abdominal x-rays will allow for a more exact examination of the spleen and liver. An abdominal ultrasound is invaluable for diagnosing disease. In addition, an echocardiogram can assist in diagnosing heart disorders, clots (thrombi), or protrusions in the walls of the abdomen (hernia). Your veterinarian can also use a diagnostic technique by which the internal anatomy is illuminated by using an injected radioactive tracer. This technique is used for a colorectal scintigraphy, where the colon is examined for abnormalities, and for a portovenography, which allows for examination of the portal system, and which can confirm whether there is a portosystemic shunt (PSS) – i.e., a diversion of blood flow. In simple terms, the radiopaque injection (tracer) will allow your doctor to visually examine the blood flow, and see whether the blood is passing through the liver to be filtered and detoxified, or whether the blood is being shunted – diverted – around the liver, creating a toxic condition for the entire system. Angiography, another imaging process using this technique, will allow your doctor to confirm possible abnormal openings and passages (arteriovenous fistulae) in your cat's liver by visually tracing blood flow through the arteries and veins. A sample of tissue may also need to be taken from the liver (liver biopsy), if liver disease is suspected. Your cat will probably be hospitalized for monitoring and for fluid therapy, since dehydration and fluid retention are causes for concern. Your cat's system will need to be detoxed to prevent critical damage to the brain and system. Surgery may be necessary, but it is dependent on the underlying cause of the disease. If your cat has abdominal fluid build-up, your veterinarian will also prescribe diuretic drugs to treat this. After your cat has been discharged from care, you will need to restrict its activity until the abdominal swelling has resolved. Dietary changes may be in order, but you will need to consult with your veterinarian before making any major changes to your cat's meals. For example, if your cat is suffering from abdominal distention, it may need to be on a low salt diet to mitigate the fluid retention, but if your veterinarian wants your cat to have more fluid intake with increased urination so that the system will clear, dietary indications will be different. If your cat is diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, your doctor will likely recommend a low protein diet, until the liver is at full functioning ability, but again, do not make these changes unless they are recommended by your doctor. Your veterinarian will plan follow-up care based on the underlying disease. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/high-blood-sugar-cats,High Blood Sugar in Cats,"Like in people, cats’ blood sugar should stay in a specific range to maintain normal body processes. The normal range for a cat’s blood sugar, or blood glucose, is 80 to 120 mg/dL. However, certain situations can lead to high blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia, in cats. The pancreas produces insulin, which is a hormone that helps blood glucose enter the body’s cells so it can be used as energy. High blood glucose can develop if a cat’s pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate their blood sugar or if the insulin it produces does not effectively reduce blood glucose (i.e., insulin resistance). This condition is called diabetes mellitus . When blood glucose levels get too high, excess glucose will be eliminated in the cat’s urine. High blood sugar on its own isn’t a medical emergency. However, unresolved feline hyperglycemia can quickly lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA develops when the liver breaks down fat because the body’s cells lack adequate glucose to use as an energy source. Fat breakdown produces chemicals called ketones, which can accumulate in the body and lead to serious, life-threatening illness. Symptoms of high blood sugar in cats include: Excessive water intake Excessive urination Increased appetite Weight loss Cats who are seriously ill, such as those with diabetic ketoacidosis, usually have more severe clinical signs, including: Loss of appetite Vomiting Lethargy The leading cause of feline hyperglycemia is diabetes mellitus. One study estimated that approximately 1 in 200 cats has diabetes mellitus. Any cat can develop diabetes mellitus, but it’s most common in cats over 6 years of age. Cats are usually overweight or obese when they develop diabetes, but then lose weight as the disease progresses. Tonkinese , Norwegian Forest Cats , and Burmese cats are reportedly predisposed to developing diabetes when compared to crossbred cats. Additional causes of increased blood sugar in cats include: Anxiety —Stress, reactivity, or fear can increase blood sugar in cats. This commonly occurs during veterinary visits if cats become stressed out or irritable. In this case, the blood sugar is only temporarily elevated and doesn’t reflect true disease. Cushing’s disease —Cushing’s disease, or hyperadrenocorticism, is an overproduction of cortisol due to a tumor of the pituitary gland or adrenal gland. Cushing’s disease is associated with diabetes mellitus and is more common in dogs than cats. Acromegaly —Acromegaly occurs in cats who produce excess growth hormone, which is usually due to a tumor in the pituitary gland. This diagnosis should be considered in diabetic cats who continue to gain weight despite good control of the disease. Acromegaly is most common in middle-aged to older male cats, and Maine Coon cats may be predisposed. Other conditions that may predispose a cat to hyperglycemia include recurrent episodes of pancreatitis and kidney failure (especially acute or sudden failure). Some medications, such as glucocorticoids (i.e., steroids, such as prednisolone ), hormone drugs, and diuretics, increase the risk of hyperglycemia. In cats, this is most commonly associated with the long-term administration of steroids. Your veterinarian can detect high blood sugar with routine blood work during your cat’s annual wellness appointment. High blood sugar can also be diagnosed using a drop of blood and a glucometer. If your veterinarian suspects diabetes, they may perform this test prior to running full blood work for a faster diagnosis. Your vet may also perform urine testing, or urinalysis, to see if your cat has glucose in their urine. To help your veterinarian make a diagnosis, important things to share about your cat include: Changes in appetite Changes in drinking or urinating habits Any vomiting Changes in weight Diabetes mellitus is primarily managed with insulin administration and dietary changes. Your veterinarian can teach you how to give your cat insulin injections at home. There are multiple types of insulin available, and your veterinarian will recommend the type that is best for your cat. Examples include: Protamine zinc insulin ( ProZinc ®) Glargine ( Lantus ®) Detemir (Levemir®) For at-home administration of insulin, you will need insulin syringes and a safe way to dispose of needles . There are two types of insulin syringes: U-100 and U-40 . You must ensure you use the right syringe type for the insulin’s concentration, or the dose you give will not be appropriate and could cause dangerously low blood sugar. New oral treatments may be successful for some cats. For example, Bexacat ™ (bexagliflozin tablets) is an insulin-free oral medication for diabetic cats that became available in 2023. This treatment is meant to help improve blood glucose levels in diabetic cats who haven’t been previously treated with insulin. Your veterinarian may recommend a prescription diet to manage your cat’s diabetes. Some possibilities include: Purina® Pro Plan® Veterinary Diets DM Dietetic Management ( dry or canned ) Royal Canin®/MD Veterinary Diet Glycobalance ( dry or canned ) Hill’s Prescription Diet m/d GlucoSupport ( dry or canned ) There are also over-the-counter options that may be appropriate for some cats. With strict dietary management, some cats can go into diabetic remission and will not be dependent on insulin. There are also over-the-counter options that may be appropriate for some cats. With strict dietary management, some cats can go into diabetic remission and will not be dependent on insulin. Transient feline hyperglycemia that occurs due to stress or anxiety doesn’t typically need to be treated with medication. However, your veterinarian may recommend ways to reduce stress for future veterinary visits. These may include anti-anxiety medications, like gabapentin, or feline pheromone products . Some cats can go into diabetic remission. According to the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) , your cat has the best chance of going into remission if you achieve good blood glucose control within six months of diagnosis. Cats who do not achieve diabetic remission will be dependent on medical treatment for the remainder of their life. Because diabetes causes your cat to urinate more, it’s important that your cat always has access to fresh water and a clean litter box. Cats with diabetes are also more likely to develop urinary tract infections , so contact your veterinarian if you notice your cat straining in the litter box or frequently urinating small amounts, or if you see blood in your cat’s urine. Control of diabetes requires strict dietary management. This includes providing a well-balanced diet and usual feeding routine, restricting your cat’s access to treats, and not feeding table scraps. To help prevent your cat from developing diabetes, keep them at a healthy weight and feed them a healthy diet. Schedule annual wellness exams, including blood work, with your veterinarian, who will assess your cat’s weight and make any recommendations about dietary changes. If a cat’s high blood sugar is not controlled, they can develop a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA occurs when the liver breaks down fat for energy, which leads to the accumulation of ketones in the blood. Work with your veterinarian to develop a safe treatment plan for your cat. Always provide access to water, and restrict access to treats and table scraps. Survival times vary widely, but well-managed diabetic cats can live for several years. One study reported a median survival time approaching one and a half years. Another study reported that almost two-thirds of cats survived more than one year, approximately one-fourth survived more than three years, and around 10% survived for more than five years after diagnosis. A blood glucose over 250 to 300 mg/dL is considered dangerously high in cats. If you have a diabetic cat with blood glucose levels over 300 mg/dL despite treatment, contact your veterinarian.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hyperlipidemia,High Cholesterol in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hyperlipidemia is characterized by abnormally excessive amounts of fat, and/or fatty substances in the blood. Chylomicrons are micro particles of liquid fat, in the class of lipids, which include both triglycerides and cholesterol, and which are formed during the digestion of fats from food. After eating a meal, the nutrients in an animal’s body pass into the small intestine, from which chylomicrons are absorbed 30-60 minutes later. Normally, the absorption of chylomicrons increases serum triglycerides for 3-10 hours, but some animals will have high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels for more than twelve hours after a meal - one of the main indications of hyperlipidemia. The clear part of the blood, the serum, is referred to as being lipemic when it has levels of triglycerides measuring over 200 mg/dL. Sometimes, levels of triglycerides in an animal’s serum can be even greater than 1000 mg/dL, giving the serum a milky, opaque appearance. This is medically referred to as lactescence (literally, being milky). Certain diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism can decrease the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is responsible for dissolving lipids. Diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hyperadrenocorticism can affect the liver in such a way that the liver produces more very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), resulting in increased lipid levels in the blood. Other diseases, like nephrotic syndrome, cause the liver to increase production of cholesterol. Conversely, if the liver itself is diseased, it may not be able to excrete cholesterol at all. Hyperlipidemia can also be the result of an inherited disease in certain breeds of cats. Symptoms of hyperlipidemia include seizures, abdominal pain, nervous system dysfunctions, patches on the skin, and cutaneous xanthomata, which are yellowish-orange lipid-filled bumps (i.e., bumps filled with a fatty, greasy liquid). Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms, diet, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health. Your pet will most probably need to be hospitalized so that it can be put on a strict fast for twelve hours. After twelve hours or more, your veterinarian will order a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a serum sample for biochemical analysis, and a urinalysis. If triglycerides are greater than 100 mg/dL, and/or if cholesterol is greater than 200 mg/dL, your cat will be diagnosed hyperlipidemic. The results of the blood work and urinalysis will allow your veterinarian to rule out the various underlying diseases that cause hyperlipidemia. Your veterinarian may also perform further testing for hyperadrenocorticism and hypothyroidism, depending on the blood work results. It may also be relevant to check your pet’s lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Initially, treatment will begin with changing your cat's existing diet to one which contains less than ten percent fat. If this is not effective, alternative medical treatments may be prescribed at your veterinarian’s discretion. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments so that your cat's serum triglyceride levels can be monitored. This will be for the prevention of possibly fatal bouts of acute pancreatitis as the result of abnormally high levels of fat in the blood. Image: Mr. Nikon via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_azotemia_uremia,High Levels of Blood Nitrogen in Cats,"PetMD Editorial An excess level of nitrogen-based substances compounds such as urea, creatinine, and other body waste compounds in the blood is defined as azotemia. It can be caused by higher than normal production of nitrogen-containing substances (with high protein diet or gastrointestinal bleeding), improper filtration in the kidneys (kidney disease), or reabsorption of urine back to bloodstream. Uremia, meanwhile, also leads to an accumulation of waste products in the blood, but is due to improper excretion of the waste products through the urine because of abnormal kidney function. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). The CBC results may confirm nonregenerative anemia, which is common in cats with chronic kidney disease and failure. Hemoconcentration may also occur in some cats with azotemia, whereby the blood thickens due to a decrease of fluid content. Along with identifying abnormally high concentrations of urea, creatinine, and other nitrogen-based compounds in the blood, a biochemistry test may reveal high levels of potassium in the blood ( hyperkalemia ). The urinalysis, meanwhile, may reveal changes in urine specific gravity (a urinalysis parameter commonly used in the evaluation of kidney function) and abnormally high concentrations of protein in the urine. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound are two other valuable tools often used by veterinarians to diagnose azotemia and uremia. They can help in determining the presence of urinary obstructions and the size and structure of the kidneys -- smaller kidneys are commonly found in cats with chronic kidney disease, while larger kidneys are associated with acute kidney failure or obstruction. In some cats, a kidney tissue sample will be collected to confirm the diagnosis of kidney disease and also to eliminate the possibility of other acute or chronic kidney diseases that may be present. The type of treatment recommended by your veterinarian will depend on the underlying cause of the diseases, though the ultimate goal is to halt the primary disease, whether it be azotemia or uremia. In the case of urinary obstruction(s), for example, your veterinarian will try to relieve the obstruction to allow normal passage of urine. In addition, if the cat is dehydrated, intravenous fluids will be administered to stabilize the animal and rectify electrolyte deficits. The overall prognosis of this disease depends on the level of kidney damage, acute or chronic states of kidney disease, and treatment. However, as most drugs are excreted through kidneys, cats with kidney disease or failure require extra care for selection of proper medications to avoid further damage to kidneys. Don’t give any drug to your cat without prior consultation with your veterinarian. Moreover, don’t change the brand or dose of the drug prescribed by your veterinarian without prior consultation. You’ll need to monitor the urine output of your cat at home and in some patients the owners need to properly record the urine output. This record of urine output will help your veterinarian to determine the progression of the disease and overall performance of kidneys with current therapy. Your veterinarian may repeat the laboratory tests to measure the level urea and creatinine concentrations 24 hours after starting intravenous fluids. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/high-phosphorus-cats,High Phosphorus in Cats,"sonnydaez/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Phosphorus is an essential mineral for your cat’s health. It plays several important roles, including growing, maintaining, and repairing cells and tissues, as well as maintaining vitamin D and calcium levels. Phosphorus is also responsible for regulating protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism. Most of the phosphorus in a cat’s body is bonded to calcium, forming calcium phosphate, which creates and maintains healthy bones and teeth. The remainder of a cat’s phosphorus circulates in the blood to aid in metabolism. When a cat’s phosphorus levels are above a normal range (2.5 mg/dL to 5.5 mg/dL), they have a condition called hyperphosphatemia. High phosphorus in cats is most often caused by kidney disease , but other conditions can also lead to hyperphosphatemia. High phosphorus levels can result in low calcium levels, which can cause the cat’s body to break down bone to release stored calcium. If a cat’s phosphorus level has been elevated for months or years, they may experience decreased bone density, which can cause weak bones, bone pain , and fractures . In some cases, hyperphosphatemia can cause calcium to deposit in soft tissues, especially if levels are chronically elevated. This can result in painful calcified lesions on the cat’s paw, as well as calcification in blood vessels, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. Symptoms of high phosphorus in cats depend on the underlying cause of your cat’s high phosphorus levels. However, general signs include: Decreased appetite Lethargy Nausea or vomiting Weight loss Tooth loss Muscle tremors High phosphorus in cats occurs when a cat has too much phosphorus or too little calcium, because these minerals have an inverse relationship. Common causes of high phosphorus in cats include: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) —Cats with CKD don’t eliminate enough phosphorus, and hyperphosphatemia commonly develops . High phosphorus levels are linked to disease progression and increased fatality rates in cats with CKD. Addressing hyperphosphatemia is important to prevent complications of CKD and to help your cat feel better. Acute kidney injury — Conditions, such as when the bladder is blocked from an obstruction and poison ingestion , can cause acute kidney injury and can lead to high phosphorus levels because the kidneys’ ability to eliminate phosphorus is impaired. Hyperthyroidism —Excess thyroid hormones lead to increased tissue breakdown that releases phosphorus into the bloodstream, causing increased phosphorus levels. Bone cancer —Bone cancer can cause imbalances in phosphorus and calcium levels, leading to hyperphosphatemia. Osteoporosis —When bone breakdown exceeds bone formation, phosphorus is released, contributing to hyperphosphatemia. Diabetes —Diabetic cats can develop hyperphosphatemia, likely because high blood glucose levels pull phosphorus into the bloodstream. Excess vitamin D ingestion —Elevated vitamin D levels cause increased absorption of phosphorus from the intestines as well as increased reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to elevated phosphorus levels. Tumor lysis syndrome —Cancer treatments can cause damaged cancer cells to release phosphorus, leading to hyperphosphatemia. Any cat can develop hyperphosphatemia. However, older cats and those who are overweight are at an increased risk for many conditions, such as CKD and diabetes, that can lead to elevated phosphorus levels. If your cat is suspected of having hyperphosphatemia, their veterinarian will perform a comprehensive health assessment, which may include: History —Your veterinarian will ask you to provide a thorough history about any symptoms your cat has been exhibiting, pre-existing health conditions, and if your cat has your cat has swallowed anything poisonous. Physical exam —Your veterinarian will examine your cat from whiskers to tail to check for abnormalities. Screening blood work —A complete blood count (CBC) can help assess your cat’s overall health and a biochemistry profile shows your cat’s phosphorus levels, as well as other helpful parameters such as kidney values and glucose levels. Urinalysis —Your veterinarian may recommend a urinalysis to further evaluate your cat’s health. Thyroid testing —If the cause of your cat’s hyperphosphatemia is not evident, your veterinarian may recommend a thyroid test. X-rays —Your veterinarian may recommend X-rays to check for bone abnormalities or to assess your cat’s kidneys. Treatment for high phosphorus in cats depends on the underlying cause. Potential treatment strategies include: CKD —CKD has no cure, but the condition can be managed to slow disease progression and improve your cat’s quality of life. Prescription diets that are low in phosphorus are beneficial for cats with CKD. If a prescription kidney diet can’t control your cat’s phosphate levels, your veterinarian may recommend medications that block phosphate absorption from the intestines. Vitamin D toxicity —Treatment for cats affected by vitamin D toxicity includes intravenous (IV) fluids and medications to prevent absorption of vitamin D, and to decrease phosphorus and calcium levels. Hyperthyroidism —Controlling your cat’s hyperthyroidism can help normalize their phosphorus levels. Diabetes —Treating your cat’s diabetes will regulate their blood glucose concentrations, which can help normalize their phosphorus levels. In some cases, such as if your cat has hyperthyroidism or diabetes, controlling your cat’s underlying condition will keep their phosphorus levels in normal range. Cats with CKD require long-term monitoring and maintenance, and dietary management can take a month or two to normalize phosphorus levels. Your veterinarian will likely recheck your cat’s blood work every four to six weeks. Cat parents can’t prevent every case of high phosphorus. However, to reduce your feline friend’s hyperphosphatemia risk, follow these tips: Keep your cat at a healthy weight to help reduce their risk for conditions, such as diabetes and CKD, that can lead to elevated phosphorus levels. Store all medications and supplements in a safe location, away from your cat. Schedule regular veterinary visits to monitor your cat’s health, so conditions are detected early when they are easier to treat and manage.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/traumatic/high-rise-syndrome-cats,High-Rise Syndrome in Cats,"iStock/RobertPetrovic High-rise syndrome refers to the common set of injuries that cats get from falling from the second story of a building or higher. These injuries include chest trauma, shock , head and facial injuries, and limb fractures. The term “high-rise syndrome” was coined by veterinarians in New York City in the 1980s. They noticed an interesting phenomenon—that cats seemed to survive very high falls. These vets noted the same triad of injuries in many of these cats. Overall, these patients had a great survival rate, even with some cats falling as much as 32 stories. Cats have a special ability that allows them to orient themselves when falling so that they land feet-first. They can rotate and twist their bodies midair to right themselves quickly, then arch their back, like a parachutist, to increase their drag and slow their fall. This is called the “righting reflex.” Cats that fall from greater than seven stories suffer fewer injuries than those that fall shorter distances. Researchers believe this is because the average-sized cat reaches terminal velocity—meaning they stop speeding up—after seven stories (about 70 feet). Cats can relax their body, so they are less tense when they hit the ground, resulting in less injury. High-rise syndrome is more common in young cats who are less risk-averse, and during warmer weather when apartment windows are more likely to be open. While 90% of cats will survive falling from a high-rise building, about a third of those cats won’t survive without veterinary help. There are two big takeaways from this research: Even if your cat fell from a very high distance (i.e., 30 stories or more), don’t assume the fall is fatal. There is a good chance your cat can survive with veterinary care. If your cat sustained a fall, take them to the nearest veterinary hospital immediately. There are several common injuries that occur in these cats that need to be addressed. Symptoms of high-rise syndrome in cats include: Difficulty breathing Panting Listlessness Pale gums Cold body temperature Lameness Blood coming from the mouth Broken teeth Facial trauma Limb disfigurement, swelling , or pain Cats enjoy sitting on windowsills to watch the birds fly by. This can become dangerous if there is no screen in the window. If the cat is startled or falls asleep, they can fall out. Young cats and kittens are more likely to be curious, active, and adventurous, leading them to push their boundaries. Additionally, they lack the experience with hazards found in older cats and thus make up a larger percentage of high-rise syndrome victims. High-rise syndrome is diagnosed based on a history of falling from more than two stories. Following a diagnosis of high-rise syndrome, your vet will want to do several tests to find out which internal and external injuries your cat has. After doing a thorough physical exam, your veterinarian will want to take X-rays. They may also recommend more imaging, like an ultrasound, to check for possible abdominal bleeding. Bloodwork will typically be recommended. At first, treatment for high-rise syndrome in cats is focused on shock management and stabilization. After the first 24 hours post-trauma, the treatment focus may shift to fixing orthopedic injuries, such as fractures. About half of the cats who have high-rise syndrome have respiratory distress, with bruising of the lungs (pulmonary contusions) and a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) being common injuries. These cats may need oxygen support and need to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) with an oxygen chamber. Head and face injuries are also very common, with many affected cats having broken teeth, fractures of the hard palate (the bone right above the roof of their mouth), and facial trauma. If these injuries are bad enough to prevent a cat from eating, a feeding tube may need to be placed temporarily until they heal. Click here to download this medical illustration. Orthopedic injuries, like broken legs or luxated (out of the joint) hips, shoulders, or elbows are also common. Any superficial wounds need to be thoroughly cleaned , then the bone injuries are set and bandaged. Orthopedic surgery may be needed. After being discharged from the hospital, watch your cat’s mental activity, food/water intake, and stool/urine output closely. Cats breathe out of their nose, so panting is generally considered a sign of respiratory distress. If your cat is panting, take them to be seen by the closest emergency vet immediately. Sometimes pulmonary contusions (bruising on the lungs) can worsen over 48 hours following trauma. Managing stress during recovery is important. Allow your cat a comfortable, quiet place to rest where they have easy access to all their resources. A soft food diet may be needed if they had any trauma to the face or teeth. If your cat had any orthopedic injuries, they will likely be put under strict activity restriction orders. This may require setting them up in a small bathroom or large dog crate to prevent excessive use of the affected limbs. Litter boxes with low entry points or a ramp entry may be helpful for them to get in and out of the box. Thankfully, high-rise syndrome can be prevented by not giving your cat access to open windows. Keep window screens tightly in place and replace them if they are getting flimsy or have holes or gaps. If you do not have screens, keep your windows shut. Remove any furniture that would allow a cat access to a higher window. Keep balcony doors shut or install screen doors to your balcony. Consider installing a catio to allow your cat a safe place to bird-watch . The back legs are more commonly broken than any other bone in a cat’s body. The tibia (shin bone) is broken most, and the femur (thigh bone) is broken second-most often in cats with high-rise syndrome. Lefman S, Prittie J. High-rise syndrome in cats and dogs .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_hip_dysplasia,Hip Dysplasia in Cats,"Hip dysplasia is the medical term describing abnormal development of the hip joint. Cats with hip dysplasia have poorly aligned hips that are too loose, which leads to discomfort. The hip joint is made of a ball and socket. The ball is the round-shaped head of the femur bone in the hip and the socket is the cup-shaped depression in the cat’s pelvis. In cats with hip dysplasia the ball does not sit firmly in the socket, which results in a loose joint. This abnormal hip joint leads to pain and reduced function. Over time this poor connection leads to early arthritis as the body tries to stabilize the joint and compensate for the abnormality, laying down new bone and bone spurs. Hip dysplasia is a degenerative disease, meaning that it worsens over time. Bony remodeling (where the body removes and builds bone) and arthritis worsens, resulting in greater discomfort and impaired mobility. Fortunately, hip dysplasia is rarer in cats than in dogs, and many cats with hip dysplasia may never show clinical signs. Researchers suspect this is because cats are better at compensating for hind limb lameness and hiding their pain. It is still important to be aware of the condition, especially if you have a purebred cat. Some purebreds have a higher risk for dysplasia . Click here to download this medical illustration. Many cats will never show obvious clinical signs of hip dysplasia and may hide their pain well. Their signs are often more subtle. with the most common clinical signs including: Reluctance to jump to high surfaces Avoiding stairs Hesitance to squat in the litter box Going to the bathroom outside the litter box Excessive chewing/licking at the hip area Avoiding physical activity Changes in temperament, such as becoming agitated, aggressive, or grumpy Rarely, lameness or stiff gait Hip dysplasia is an inherited condition, and purebred cats have a higher chance of developing it. Hip dysplasia is more common in the following breeds: Maine Coon Persian Himalayan Siberian While hip dysplasia in cats is generally considered to be caused by genetics, some underlying factors can predispose a cat to develop hip dysplasia. Obesity : Excess weight puts increased force on the hip joint, leading to excessive wear and tear. This can result in degenerative changes accelerating breakdown of the ball and socket. Other orthopedic conditions, like knee problems, can lead to increased stress and breakdown of the hip joint. Injuries can also lead to earlier onset of degenerative changes and accelerate the progression of hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia is often diagnosed by a combination of a physical exam and X-rays. Your veterinarian will want to palpate, or feel, your cat's hips. They will likely move the hips through a range of motions to see if they move normally. During this exam, c ats with hip dysplasia will often exhibit something called Ortolani sign, which is an abnormal movement of the hip joint when the ball is too loose and comes out of the socket. Sometimes cats can be challenging patients to palpate, especially when they’re in pain. They may be stiff or aggressive when their hips are put through this range of motion. Sedation may be needed to facilitate a thorough physical exam of the hips. Radiographs (X-rays) are very helpful in diagnosing hip dysplasia. With X-rays your veterinarian will be able to see the shape of the femur and the pelvis and be able to assess any degenerative changes. Treatment of hip dysplasia can be challenging in cats. Generally, treatment can include one or more of the following: Pain Medications and/or joint supplements : Pet parents should never give their cat any human pain medication, which can be very dangerous. For example, acetaminophen is toxic to cats , and can result in death. Your veterinarian may prescribe drugs that are appropriate for cats, like opioid medications. Many veterinarians will recommend supplements to support joint health. Products like Cosequin or Dasuquin contain glucosamine and chondroitin to support cartilage health. While they will not undo damage in your cat’s hips, they have demonstrated some success at slowing down the progression of degenerative arthritis changes. As with prescribed drugs, supplements must only be given under the direction of a veterinarian, as some supplements can be harmful. Weight Management : Obesity can speed the breakdown of the hip joint and cause subsequent pain. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most important things you can do for your cat to improve their quality of life. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is usually accomplished through a combination of dieting and exercise. Exercise can be very challenging to encourage in cats, and may be discouraged if a cat has a debilitating orthopedic disease. Work with your veterinarian to determine the appropriate amount of food that your cat should receive in a day. Your vet may suggest changing your cat’s diet to encourage weight loss, through over-the-counter or prescription diet food. Given how finicky some cats can be, monitor your cat’s appetite to ensure they are eating the new diet. Surgery : While surgery for hip dysplasia treatment in cats is uncommon, surgery may be recommended if the condition seriously impairs a cat’s quality of life. Two of the more common types include femoral head ostectomy (FHO) and a total hip replacement. Both of these surgeries aim to decrease pain by eliminating the grinding and misalignment (called subluxation) in the joint itself. While hip dysplasia is uncommon in cats, most cats do well with weight management, joint supplements, and pain control. With medical management, the prognosis is good overall. Hip dysplasia often does not dramatically shorten a patient’s life expectancy unless they are born with genetically severe abnormal conformation in their hips. Because hip dysplasia is largely inherited, there is not much that a pet parent can do to prevent it in their cat. Avoid breeding cats that have been diagnosed with hip dysplasia. Keep your cat at a healthy weight to minimize excessive force on their joints and earlier onset of arthritic changes in the hip joints. Yes, cats can live good-quality lives with hip dysplasia as long as their pain is controlled. Yes, it can be painful. Sometimes it is not, however, and is only discovered incidentally on X-rays. Some cats with hip dysplasia never show any clinical signs and are not overtly uncomfortable. Cerna P, Timmermans J, Komenda D, Nyvltova I, Proks P. National Library of Medicine.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_tracheal_hole,Hole in the Trachea in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Tracheal perforation is a loss of the integrity of the tracheal wall, in the form of a hole or rip, allowing leakage of air into the surrounding tissues and creating air pockets under the skin, air collection in the mediastinum (in between the lungs), and potentially air in the sac around the heart, free air in the chest cavity, and air in the most posterior part of the abdominal cavity (pneumoretroperitoneum). This loss of integrity can be caused by a penetrating trauma, trauma from inside the trachea, or blunt neck or chest trauma. The severity of tracheal perforation ranges from a small perforation to complete tracheal avulsion (tearing away of the trachea). In cats with complete avulsion, the mediastinal tissues can help to maintain the airways. The following signs may occur immediately after injury or up to a week later: Penetrating cervical (neck) wounds: Perforation by a veterinarian (iatrogenic): Blunt trauma can cause intrathoracic tracheal avulsion: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your pet, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. An arterial blood gas analysis may also be done to check oxygenation of blood. A pulse oximetry measurement may show less than normal (or even low) oxygen saturation. Side view X-rays of the neck and chest are essential for diagnosis. Air pockets under the skin, air collection in the mediastinum, free air in the chest cavity, and potentially air in the sac around the heart will be seen with tracheal perforation. In cases of tracheal avulsion, the site of disruption may be visible. Abdominal X-rays may show a pneumoretroperitoneum -- air that has escaped into the space behind the lining of the stomach (peritoneum). An examination of the interior walls of the trachea can be done by tracheoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of tracheal perforation and to estimate its severity. False-negative examinations can sometimes occur. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor healing of the surgical incisions if surgery was indicated. Cats that suffer from an avulsed trachea (one that has been torn away) and do not receive surgery may suffer sudden death. In fact, even with surgery, an animal with a repaired avulsed trachea have a guarded prognosis. Call your veterinarian immediately if signs of redness, oozing or swelling are noted at the surgical incision site. The veterinarian should also be called immediately, on an emergency basis, if your cat begins to have difficulty breathing. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/hookworms-cats,Hookworms in Cats,"The following may contain Chewy links. PetMD is operated by Chewy. Hookworms are one type of intestinal parasite that can affect cats and kittens. Their name comes from their hook-like mouth parts that anchor them into the wall of the intestines, allowing them to feed on fluids and blood from their host to get nutrients. Click here to download this medical illustration. These parasites cause damage to the areas of the intestines where they feed, and they can release a blood thinning compound that causes bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. There are several possible symptoms of hookworm infection, including anemia, digested blood in the stool (black tarry stool), weight loss, and poor hair coat quality. Cats can experience blood loss due to hookworm feeding. This can lead to anemia, which is more common in kittens than in adult cats. Hookworms are very small compared with some other types of intestinal parasites. They are barely visible to the naked eye, so they are not typically seen in stool. Proper fecal testing is needed to diagnose this issue and properly treat it. Cats can get hookworms in many ways, including: Ingestion: Cats can get hookworms by eating vertebrates, such as rodents, or by eating cockroaches that are carrying hookworm larvae. Kittens can get hookworms through their mother’s milk as well. Larvae (eggs) picked up in the soil: Hookworm larvae hatch and can stay alive in the ground for several weeks or even months. When a cat ingests these immature hookworms—sometimes by licking their feet after walking outside—most larvae move to the intestinal tract and stay there. Larvae burrowing into cat’s skin: Once they burrow through the skin, they migrate to the lungs and trachea, where they are coughed up and swallowed. Hookworms are more common in warm, moist environments, as well as environments with overcrowding and poor sanitation. When your veterinarian checks your feline friend for hookworms, a stool sample is needed. This can be collected at the clinic, but it is less stressful for your kitty if you bring a sample with you from home. Your veterinarian has fecal collection cups available to help you collect a sample. Once they have the sample at the clinic, hookworms can be diagnosed via a fecal flotation. This is a test oftentimes performed in the clinic, but it can also be sent out to a reference lab. Fecal flotation involves the stool being mixed in a special solution, sitting for about 10 minutes, and then being examined under the microscope. This leads to diagnosis via microscopic examination of the feces. Treatment for hookworms is generally safe and inexpensive. There are several potential treatment options for feline hookworms, using the following medications that may be prescribed by your vet: Ivermectin (Heartgard) Milbemycin oxime (Interceptor) Emodepside (Profender) Selamectin (Revolution Plus) Moxidectin Two treatments of the medication prescribed by your veterinarian, given 2-3 weeks apart, are generally required since the medications will not kill larvae. The second treatment is needed to kill any larvae that transformed into adult parasites during that time. After the second dose of dewormer, recovery is rather quick and prognosis is good for full recovery from hookworm infection. While your pet is being treated for hookworms, please continue to promptly remove all feces from the litter box or yard and wash your hands after handling feces. During this time, feces can still pass hookworms on to other pets in the environment. Several measures should be taken to prevent infection or reinfection of hookworms in cats. As kittens, it is ideal for them to be treated with a veterinary-approved and prescribed dewormer by 2-3 weeks of age. It is important to keep all cats on monthly preventatives, no matter whether they are indoors only, have access to a porch, or have full access to the outdoors. Even with indoor cats, there is a risk of hookworm infection. Hygiene is a very important factor in hookworm control and prevention. Cat feces should be promptly and appropriately disposed of, and always wash your hands after handling cat feces. It is important to promptly treat any diagnosed worms as soon as they are detected. Yes. Indoor cats can be exposed to carriers such as rodents or cockroaches. It is also possible for people to track parasites inside on their shoes or belongings. Yes, via their feces. Children should not be allowed to play in potentially contaminated areas, such as non-covered sandboxes or beaches, since cats can use these areas as their own personal litter box. While feline hookworms may not affect humans internally, they can cause a disease called cutaneous larva migrans, a migration of hookworms into the skin of humans. Brooks, W.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/poisoning-toxicity/c_ct_hormone_replacement_poisoning_in_cats,Hormone Replacement Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is used in various forms by many women, including creams, gels, sprays and patches. However, accidental exposure of cats to these hormone replacement products can cause serious illness. Cats are easily poisoned by these products. Hormone replacement products can also be poisoning to dogs. If you would like to learn how they affect dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Symptoms associated with hormone replacement poisoning will vary depending on the sex of the cat. There is also concern that prolonged exposure to HRT products could cause bone marrow suppression leading to aplastic anemia (a severe blood disease) and possibly mammary tumors (breast cancer.) Hormone replacement therapies are used in women to replace estrogen and treat symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, mood swings and bone loss. HRT medications are commonly supplied as creams, gels, sprays or patches. Women are often advised to apply the medication to the wrists, inner elbows, or legs. Cats typically become exposed by licking the HRT medication from a woman’s skin. They may also be exposed by chewing on or licking discarded patches. Diagnosis relies on the appearance of expected clinical signs and known (or suspected) exposure to an HRT product. Estrogen levels can also be measured in the blood to confirm the diagnosis, if necessary. Symptoms are often reversible by eliminating further exposure to the medication. However, symptoms may take months to resolve completely in some cases. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/horners-syndrome-cats,Horner's Syndrome in Cats,"Horner’s syndrome in cats is a group of changes to the appearance of the eye that occurs because of damage to the nerves that supply the affected eye. Specifically, the nerves affected are part of the sympathetic nervous system. But what does that mean? There’s a part of the nervous system that controls bodily functions without the cat’s control, and the same goes for us humans! This part of the nervous system is called the autonomic nervous system. Examples of functions controlled by the autonomic nervous system include pupil dilation or constriction, sweating, and intestinal movement. The autonomic nervous system has two main branches: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic system maintains a relaxed state and is thought of as the “rest and digest” branch. The sympathetic system , on the contrary, prepares the body for “fight or flight.” Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have an effect on the eyes. The sympathetic nervous system dilates the pupil, opens the eyelid, and keeps the eye forward in its socket. Basically, it offers changes to the eye that help a cat in flight or fight see their surroundings better. On the other hand, the parasympathetic system constricts the pupil, raises the third eyelid, and retracts the eye into the socket. In a relaxed state, your cat doesn’t need a wide-open eye to survey its surroundings. Both systems are always working in tandem, with the dominant system at any given moment determined by what is happening around the cat. When damage occurs to the sympathetic nerves that control the eye, the parasympathetic nerves dominate, resulting in changes to the eye and creating Horner’s syndrome. Horner’s syndrome in cats is not an emergency, but if you’ve noticed any signs of Horner’s, contact your veterinarian. Horner’s syndrome is common in cats and is easily recognized by most veterinarians. Horner’s syndrome can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms of Horner’s syndrome in cats may include: One pupil more constricted than the other Elevated third eyelid on the side with constricted pupil Retraction of the same eyeball into the head Slight drooping of the upper eyelid on the affected side The sympathetic nerves that control the eye begin in the brain, travel through the brainstem, then down the spinal cord in the neck, and then partway down the spinal cord in the chest. These nerves then course back up the neck (outside the spinal cord) near the middle ear, and then into the eye. This is a very long nerve path, and damage anywhere along this path can lead to Horner’s syndrome. Examples of potential causes include: Tumors of the brain , spinal cord, middle ear, or behind the eye Stroke Trauma that pulls on the foreleg, stretching the nerves in the armpit (brachial plexus avulsion) Mass in the chest that damages the sympathetic trunk Middle ear infection Abscess behind the eye Head trauma, including being hit by a car, being bitten, or falling from a significant height In 42% of cases , Horner’s syndrome occurs with no known cause (referred to as “idiopathic”). Any breed of cat can develop Horner’s syndrome. Veterinarians diagnose Horner’s syndrome in cats with a physical examination. Once the veterinarian confirms that the cat has Horner’s, their next step is to identify which segment of the nerve pathway is affected. This information is key for prognosis and treatment. The veterinarian may place a medicated drop in the affected eye. Based on whether the eye dilates, they may be able to narrow down which part of the long sympathetic nerve pathway is affected. Other diagnostics could include: Neurologic examination to help localize the lesion (by checking reflexes and responses and watching gait) X-rays of the chest, neck, and skull Ear examination (otoscopic exam) to look for a ruptured eardrum or evidence of a middle ear infection Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if a brain or spinal cord injury is suspected Computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, neck, or chest Horner’s syndrome itself isn’t painful and doesn’t cause blindness. Therefore, the syndrome isn’t usually treated. Instead, the veterinarian treats the underlying cause of Horner’s syndrome if possible. If the cause of Horner’s is within the brain or along the pathway leading up to the middle ear, it generally carries a less favorable prognosis. For example, tumors may require surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, which does not guarantee resolution of Horner’s syndrome. If Horner’s syndrome is caused by damage along the pathway from the middle ear to the eye, the prognosis is much more favorable. For middle ear infections, treatment involves antibiotics. The eardrum may be purposely punctured (myringotomy) to allow the veterinarian to collect a sample for culture. This enables the veterinarian to choose an effective treatment for the specific bacteria causing the infection. Antibiotics are given for six to eight weeks to ensure adequate treatment. If the middle ear infection isn’t resolving, the veterinarian may recommend removing the ear canal and cleaning out the bony region that houses parts of the middle and inner ear, a procedure known as total ear canal ablation and bulla osteotomy, or TECA-BO. Unfortunately, this surgery can also result in Horner’s syndrome approximately 58% of the time . This is because during surgery there can sometimes be damage to the sympathetic nerves, which can also cause Horner’s syndrome. Some veterinarians may consider prescribing phenylephrine drops for management of the clinical signs. This would work for animals whose nerve damage is between the middle ear and the eye. Idiopathic Horner’s syndrome usually spontaneously resolves on its own anywhere from several weeks to several months after first appearing. Remember that Horner’s syndrome is not painful or life-threatening, and most of these cats will live long lives, even if Horner’s syndrome doesn’t completely resolve. The caveat here is that some underlying causes of Horner’s syndrome, such as brain tumors, carry a poor prognosis. In cases with a known cause, cats who will improve usually do so within two to six weeks after the inciting incident or after the cause has been treated. Some cats may have improvement in some of the signs of Horner’s syndrome but won’t have complete resolution. Around 25% of cats who develop Horner’s syndrome after TECA-BO will have the condition permanently. If your cat’s Horner’s syndrome is caused by a traumatic injury or an ear infection, make sure to speak with your veterinarian about pain management. Be sure to provide a safe and comfortable location for your cat’s recovery. Yes, vigorous cleaning of a cat’s ears can lead to Horner’s syndrome. Accidentally puncturing the eardrum or putting cleaning materials into the ear when the eardrum is ruptured can result in Horner’s syndrome. Very often the cause is never determined. However, some common known causes include head or neck trauma—such as a car accident, bite wound, or high-rise fall—and ear inflammation or damage from ear cleaning. Horner’s syndrome is not painful, but underlying causes such as an ear infection or trauma can cause pain.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/hot-spots-cats,Hot Spots on Cats,"Hot spots are superficial skin infections that are caused by a cat licking, chewing, scratching, or biting at the skin’s surface. Cats have a normal amount of bacteria, yeast, and fungus on the skin. When the skin is disturbed or irritated by a cat’s actions, it causes the bacteria to overpopulate, creating a skin infection called a pyoderma. The terms “acute moist dermatitis” and “pyotraumatic dermatitis” are often used to describe hot spots on cats. Long-haired cats and those with thicker coats may be more likely to get hot spots because they have a higher chance for inciting factors to get trapped under the coat and irritate the skin. Hot spots are more common during hot, humid summer months but can occur year-round, depending on the inciting cause. Hot spots are commonly found on a cat’s face/chin, belly, or base of the tail, although they can be on any part of the body. These skin lesions are often painful and should be treated by your veterinarian as soon as possible. Health Tools Answer a few questions about your pet's symptom, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will give you the most likely causes and next steps. A hot spot–induced skin infection is initially moist, itchy, and inflamed, usually causing the skin in the area to turn red with or without hair loss. The infection then leads to pus formation, causing the wound to become more wet. The moisture is then trapped in the remaining hair, causing mats to form on top of the wound. The pus will dry and the damaged skin will adhere to this infection site, causing a crusty, moist bed of infection that is likely very uncomfortable to your cat. The matted fur will often disguise how severely affected the underlying skin might be. The chewing, biting, or scratching makes the hot spot much worse, so the sooner you can have your cat examined by their vet the better. While hot spots are more common in hot, humid climates and occur more in the spring and summer, they can happen during any time of year. Bugs or allergies might make your cat itchy year-round, thus causing hot spots. Cats with more dense, heavier hair coats are more likely to develop hot spots, as their saliva gets trapped under the fur and will infect the skin, causing an itch. Multiple species of Staphylococcus bacteria are the most common natural inhabitant on a cat’s skin and are the most common cause of a bacterial skin infection in cats. Staph infections are not usually contagious in cats. Hot spots in cats are caused by a variety of underlying conditions, such as: Fleas are the most common cause of hot spots on cats. Other parasites, such as mites (e.g., skin mange or ear mites), mosquitoes, or ants, can also cause a cat to scratch or bite in response to the pain or itch, causing a hot spot. Allergies are also a common cause of hot spots in cats. Flea allergies are common in cats and just one tiny flea or microscopic flea egg can cause a cat’s entire body to be incredibly itchy, causing them to self-inflict hot spots. Outdoor cats are exposed to more pollen and environmental causes of allergies and could be at higher risk for developing hot spots. Cats are skilled self-groomers. Any change to a cat’s daily routine or their normal environment can cause them to be stressed, and their stress response is often to overgroom themselves. Overgrooming in cats leads to hair loss and skin infections, which in turn can cause hot spots. Hot spots in certain areas of the body, such as over the hips or on the hind end, might indicate that your cat is experiencing pain or discomfort. The hips are a common place for arthritis and your cat may chew or bite at the painful area, causing a hot spot. Anal gland disease would also be a reason for your cat to focus on their hind end in a way that might lead first to a wound, then to a hot spot. In general, a wound or injury anywhere on the body can lead to hot spots, as it takes only a few minutes of your cat chewing, biting, or scratching at the skin for the normal bacteria to overpopulate and a skin infection to begin. Hot spots on cats can often be diagnosed with a physical examination by your veterinarian. While the skin lesion itself might be diagnosed with the naked eye, sometimes it does require diagnostic testing to be able to determine the underlying cause to make sure that the itch or pain does not return. If it is a primary skin issue, a skin scraping, skin cytology, or skin culture might be needed to isolate the primary bacteria, mite, or fungus causing the issue. If pain is suspected, such as with hot spots over the hips, x-rays might be necessary to look for conditions such as arthritis. It’s important to diagnose both the hot spot and the underlying cause to help prevent the issue from recurring. While there are many treatment plans for hot spots on cats, the first step your veterinarian will do is remove all of the hair on and surrounding the lesion. They will use clippers or a special razor to expose the infected skin. Once the hair is gone, the moisture and pus that were trapped behind it can be removed and the skin can be thoroughly cleaned. This also allows your veterinarian to visualize the extent of the hot spot, which may have had been hidden by the hair and crusting. Since hot spots can be painful, your veterinarian might choose to sedate your cat with pain medication during the cleaning procedure. After the hot spot is clipped and cleaned, your vet can perform testing on the skin, such as cytology, culture, or scraping, to help diagnose the underlying cause. The skin infection component of a hot spot is often treated with a combination of topical and oral or injectable antibiotics. Topical products, such as wipes, cleansers, mousse, and shampoos, should contain chlorhexidine as the active ingredient, as this is an effective antibacterial agent. Duoxo® S3 is a popular topical product line available over the counter that is great for skin infections and hot spot treatment. For a mite infection, a lime sulfur dip or medicated bathing might be indicated. If the infection is more severe, your veterinarian may prescribed one of the following oral or injectable prescription medications: Convenia® Cephalexin Clindamycin Clavamox® Onsior™ Meloxicam Buprenorphine Tramadol Prednisolone Chlorpheniramine If fleas are the cause of your cat’s hot spots and itchy skin, the fleas must be treated with preventatives (e.g., Revolution® Plus, Bravecto® ) and/or oral medications such as Capstar ® . Your home will also have to be disinfected. Your veterinarian will design a specific treatment plan for your cat, based on their symptoms and the underlying cause of the hot spot. A crucial part of healing any skin condition, especially hot spots, is making sure that your cat cannot reach the area to lick, scratch, chew, or bite it. Your cat should not be able to reach this area, as self-inflicted damage is a common cause of unhealed hot spots. An Elizabethan collar , inflatable collar, or protective shirt will prevent your cat from being able to continue to cause damage to the skin. The goal would be to remove the collar or shirt only after all medications are done and the hot spot is completely healed. It is also never advised to cover your cat’s hot spots with a bandage, as that traps moisture and will not allow the area to heal. Your veterinarian will give you a timeline for treatment based on your cat’s diagnosis. Hot spots can take weeks to months to heal, depending on the cause. It’s important to finish all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian and to return to the vet’s office for all follow-up appointments in a timely manner, to ensure that your cat is healing properly. It is important that only products safe for pets be used on a cat’s skin, as human products can be toxic to cats. Check with your veterinarian before using any topical products at home for your cat’s hot spot. Hot spots can be prevented by staying in tune with your cat’s medical needs. Cats should have regular checkups with their veterinarian, at least once per year. At this appointment, your vet can diagnose and discuss any medical conditions such as allergies, pain, or stress, to make sure these conditions are well managed and not causing behaviors that lead to hot spots. All cats, even if they do not go outdoors, should be on a regular flea and tick preventative. This is to protect them against both these parasites themselves, which can cause your cat to itch, as well as the diseases they may carry. Your veterinarian will prescribe the best flea and tick prevention for your cat based on its lifestyle, medical conditions, and your location. Keep in mind that hot spots can rapidly progress into a much bigger wound, so it’s important to have them examined by your vet no matter how small they might be.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/immune/how-treat-feline-immunodeficiency-virus-fiv,How to Treat Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV),"By Dr. Jennifer Coates, DVM If your veterinarian has tentatively diagnosed your cat with FIV based on a screening test, this is what you can expect to happen next. Zidovudine (AZT) and other antiviral medications have been used to treat some cats suffering from the effects of FIV infection. These drugs can reduce a cat’s viral load, but the side effects of treatment may outweigh the benefits. Veterinarians have also used interferon on cats exhibiting symptoms associated with FIV, but the benefits of this drug are questionable. Erythropoietin can be prescribed to raise the red blood cell count of an FIV positive cat suffering from anemia. Secondary bacterial and fungal infections are a common problem in cats with FIV. The appropriate use of antibiotics and antifungal medications can often improve a cat’s condition for a period of time. When a cat’s quality of life declines to an unacceptable level, euthanasia or hospice care is the best option. Many cats who test positive for FIV but are not exhibiting any symptoms of the disease can live happily for years after their diagnosis. These individuals should eat a highly nutritious diet to promote good immune function and be kept indoors to limit their exposure to infectious diseases and reduce the chances that they could spread FIV to other cats. FIV positive cats should have a physical examination, complete blood cell count, blood chemistry panel, and urinalysis performed by a veterinarian once or twice a year so any problems that do develop can be caught and addressed early. False positive results on FIV tests are real problem. A positive result in an apparently healthy cat should always be confirmed by at least one other type of test. Cats who have been vaccinated against FIV will test positive on screening tests and Western Blot tests. Cats under the age of six months will sometimes erroneously test positive on FIV screening tests because they have maternal antibodies against the disease in their bloodstream. If you have any doubts as to your cat’s diagnosis, ask your veterinarian to show you the results of at least two different types of FIV tests and explain why he or she has reached the conclusion that your cat does indeed have FIV. FIV is not a highly contagious disease, but it can be passed from cat to cat, primarily through bite wounds. There is also a small risk of disease transmission associated with sharing food bowls, mutual grooming, and other activities that could expose an uninfected cat to an infected cat’s saliva. If you live in a multiple-cat household, have all your cats tested for FIV and ask your veterinarian whether you should vaccinate your FIV-negative cats against the disease. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your cat’s condition.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/how-treat-hematuria-cats,How to Treat Hematuria in Cats,"By Dr. Jennifer Coates, DVM If your cat has been diagnosed with hematuria (blood in the urine), this is what you can expect to happen next: The veterinarian will need to determine what disorder is to blame for your cat’s hematuria. He or she will start with a physical examination and complete health history, often followed by some combination of diagnostic tests. Possibilities include: Appropriate treatment will depend on the results of these tests and the eventual diagnosis. Some of the more common disorders that cause hematuria in cats are: Feline Idiopathic Cystitis (FIC) — Medications used in the treatment of FIC include pain relievers (e.g., buprenorphine), anti-anxiety medication (e.g., amitriptyline, clomipramine, or fluoxetine), and nutritional supplements (e.g., glucosamine or pentosan polysulfate sodium). Canned food is recommended to promote the formation of dilute urine. Many cats with FIC experience intermittent flare-ups regardless of treatment. Stress relief, including clean litter boxes, ample opportunities for play and mental stimulation, preventing conflicts between feline housemates, and maintaining a consistent home environment are vital to reducing the frequency and severity of FIC attacks. Urinary Tract Infection — Feline urinary tract infections are treated with antibiotics. Sometimes a urine culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing is necessary to determine what antibiotic will resolve the infection. If the infection occurs in conjunction with struvite bladder stones, a special diet or urinary acidifier will also be necessary to dissolve the stones. Bladder Stones — Struvite bladder stones can usually be dissolved with a prescription diet or medications that acidify the urine. Calcium oxalate and other types of bladder stones are best removed via surgery. Cancer — Cancer of the urinary tract can cause hematuria. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or palliative therapy. Trauma — Injuries can lead to bleeding within the urinary tract. Rest, pain relief, symptomatic/supportive care (e.g., blood transfusions), and sometimes surgery is necessary if a cat is to recover. Bleeding Disorders — Conditions that disrupt the normal formation of blood clots can cause hematuria in cats. Treatment depends on the underlying cause (e.g., Vitamin K for some types of poisonings). Cats who are under treatment for hematuria should be kept indoors so they can be closely monitored, encouraged to eat and drink, and take any prescribed medications. When cats are taking antibiotics for a urinary tract infection, they should take the entire course, even if their condition rapidly returns to normal. Follow your veterinarian’s instructions regarding any other medications that have been prescribed. Modifications to the diet and home environment are an important part of managing some cats with hematuria. Feeding canned and/or prescription food, keeping fresh water available at all times, and stress relief are common recommendations. Ask your veterinarian what the possible side effects are of the medications your cat is taking. Find out when he or she next wants to see your cat for a progress check and whom you should call if an emergency arises outside of your veterinarian’s normal business hours. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your cat’s condition.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/hydrocephalus-cats,Hydrocephalus in Cats,"Hydrocephalus occurs when there is too much cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain, commonly referred to as “water on the brain.” CSF is made by the brain ventricles, hollow spaces inside the brain matter, and it bathes the brain and spinal cord. It normally provides much-needed nutrients and protection from pressure changes and physical trauma. In cats, hydrocephalus is considered a rare condition and usually occurs because of a congenital birth defect, when the developing skull bones at first grow to adapt to the increased fluid. Then when the skull bones stop growing and fuse, there is no longer space for extra fluid, and pressure within the skull increases. This damages the brain, leading to neurologic signs. Hydrocephalus can also develop after traumatic brain injury, infection, or cancer . Essentially, anything that would either block the flow of the CSF from the brain and down the spinal cord or cause an increase in its production can lead to hydrocephalus. It’s usually only considered an emergency in an acute setting—usually an older cat having just experienced some sort of trauma or having severe neurologic dysfunction. For many cats, even with therapy, the disease progresses, and many are humanely euthanized . Symptoms of congenital hydrocephalus usually shows up a few months after birth, but many cats may not develop symptoms until well into adulthood. Affected kittens may be described as: Smaller in size than their littermates Having a dome-shaped skull (congenital and acquired) Having open fontanelles (soft spot) Having bilateral ventrolateral strabismus, where a cat’s eyes appear to be looking downward and outward (congenital and acquired) Having variable neurologic dysfunction (congenital and acquired): Changes in behavior Restlessness Head pressing Walking in circles Altered walk (often appearing clumsy) Tetraparesis (weakness in all four limbs) Seizures , though less likely Blindness Hydrocephalus in cats is generally classified into two categories: Congenital —Congenital hydrocephalus is more common, with birth defects affecting the cerebellum and/or skull. It often occurs with other diseases such as syringomyelia (fluid pockets that develop within the spinal cord). It is thought that this condition is inherited in breeds such as the Siamese , but it has been known to occur in other breeds like the Persian and Manx . Additionally, kittens exposed to the feline panleukopenia virus or certain toxins/medications such as griseofulvin before birth can develop hydrocephalus along with other birth defects. Acquired —Any disease that blocks the CSF flow or any loss of brain tissue such as in the case of trauma and hemorrhage; cysts; inflammation (swelling); bacterial, fungal, and viral infections ( feline infectious peritonitis ); and cancer can lead to a backup of CSF into the brain or greater amounts being made. Diagnosis of hydrocephalus is made after finding certain characteristics during a physical examination and in imaging of the skull and brain. Cats will often have a dome-shaped head and neurologic dysfunction to some degree. If trauma is known to have occurred, be sure to mention the details with your veterinarian, as some cases of acquired hydrocephalus require immediate lifesaving treatment. Radiographs are also helpful, as they will show a dome-shaped yet thin-walled cranium, but the diagnosis is best made with ultrasound through the open fontanelles or with a CT scan or an MRI. Analysis of the CSF along with a culture will most likely be recommended to rule out other conditions and to help with surgical therapy. Blood work such as a complete blood cell count, internal organ function screening test, and feline leukemia and feline AIDS (FIV) testing will also be done. Treatment of hydrocephalus in cats is usually aimed at the underlying cause, if known, but it usually doesn’t lead to long-term healing, since the disease is progressive. Medical management offers temporary relief in symptoms and is usually considered palliative (not a cure). Many cats require lifelong therapy. Certain drugs such as furosemide and prednisolone can be given, as they lower the amount of CSF made; however, cats will need to be checked often and have frequent blood work because of drug side effects such as kidney injury, heart disease, and diabetes. In the acute setting, a drug such as mannitol may be given to lower the pressure within the brain. Surgical management has risks but can often lead to a better long-term prognosis, with a surgical success rate anywhere from 50 to 75 percent, especially for those with a congenital cause. Cats with severe neurologic problems and those that have failed medical management are often recommended for surgery. There are several surgical techniques, but all involve the surgical placement of a shunt, or small tube, within the brain that is then tunneled underneath the skin and connected elsewhere in the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt sends extra CSF into another area of the body, where it is easily absorbed. Cats with a CSF infection or infection elsewhere in the body or cats with abnormal CSF are often unable to receive surgery. Cats with hydrocephalus secondary to cancer may undergo more surgeries, radiation, or chemotherapy. Immunosuppressive drugs like steroids may be used for cats with auto-immune related causes. Antibiotics and antifungal agents may be prescribed for infectious causes. The prognosis for cats suffering from hydrocephalus is poor. Some cats may have little pain and can manage well with medication alone, but those suffering from extreme pain or neurologic issues are less likely to recover. Additionally, as cats affected with hydrocephalus often have neurologic problems, it is recommended to keep them away from others and away from stairs, pools, sharp corners, and other potential dangers, as their balance and coordination may be affected. For cats having undergone surgery, recovery often takes several weeks. Some can go on to have a fairly functional life if no permanent neurologic damage occurred because of the increased pressure on the brain. Other cats may show lifelong neurologic symptoms that are mild, such as difficulty walking or trouble with future training. A recovery cone may also be needed during recovery to prevent your cat from scratching at the shunt. Some complications can arise after surgery in cats receiving a shunt, such as infection; shunt failure from blockage, kinking, or bending; or too much draining of CSF, which can lead to low intracranial pressure and subdural hematoma (brain bruise) formation. If you notice anything out of place or your cat’s symptoms worsening, be sure to have them examined right away! If your cat is prescribed medication, chances are they will be on those for a long time, if not for life, so do not stop them unless told to do so by your veterinarian. The significance of these medications’ side effects is high, so future follow-ups with drug checks and blood work will be needed. It’s important to work with your vet to help manage your cat’s condition and ensure the best outcome possible, as their pain and symptoms will most likely worsen over time, needing more follow-ups or testing. Unfortunately, there’s little you can do to prevent hydrocephalus from happening, but having your cat examined at the first sign may lead to a better prognosis while minimizing its harmful effects. Keeping your cat indoors and having them routinely examined and up to date on their vaccines and flea and heartworm preventive is very important, along with preventing head injuries, which can occur from motor vehicle accidents or falls. Additionally, as the condition is thought to have a genetic trait, cats with this condition and cats that are carriers (i.e., breeding pairs) shouldn’t be bred, because of the possibility of passing on harmful traits. Yes, cats who have undergone a successful surgery to send extra CSF to the abdomen, known as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, can go on to have a fairly functional life if no permanent neurologic damage occurred, or they may have lifelong mild dysfunction such as difficulty walking or clumsiness. Still others, having been treated medically, may have a poor quality of life and humane euthanasia will be recommended. The life expectancy of hydrocephalic cats varies based on how severe the symptoms are. But since the prognosis is generally poor, especially for cats with congenital causes, many are humanely euthanized within months of diagnosis. It certainly can be painful, especially if left untreated. This is why it’s important to have your cat examined at the first sign of a problem. As the fluid gathers within the skull, increased pressure develops on the brain, which can lead to hematomas and a general state of stupor, malaise, and nausea. People who have hydrocephalus report feelings of frequent headaches and migraines, which is a good way to describe a similar state in cats.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/hypercalcemia-cats,Hypercalcemia in Cats,"Hypercalcemia means that a cat's calcium level is higher than normal in the bloodstream. Calcium is an essential mineral that keeps a cat's bones strong and helps with muscle contraction, the clotting of blood, and other essential functions. The amount of calcium in a cat's body is closely regulated, so only the amount needed is normally available at any given time. However, certain medical conditions can cause the calcium level to become too high. There are many possible causes for a cat's calcium level to be elevated. Some may be lifelong issues, while others are only temporary. If a cat has significant hypercalcemia that persists, then the extra calcium will build up in multiple organs, leading to mineralization. Organs that have mineralization are unable to function properly. For instance, high calcium can prevent the muscles throughout the body from contracting, such as within the heart, limbs, and gastrointestinal tract. A cat with hypercalcemia may develop weakness, muscle wasting, impaired heart function, and a decreased appetite, as well as other symptoms. Hypercalcemia can be life-threatening because it can lead to kidney failure, irregular heartbeat, chronic gastrointestinal issues, and inability to walk. Cats with mild hypercalcemia often do not show signs of illness. But if a cat’s total calcium level rises over a certain level, then these symptoms may be seen: Neuromuscular Lethargy Muscle wasting Muscle tremors or twitching Inability to walk Seizures Gastrointestinal Decreased appetite Anorexia Constipation or diarrhea Vomiting Renal/Urinary tract Increased thirst and urination Dehydration Vomiting Decreased appetite If bladder stones form in the urine due to calcium buildup, a cat may have blood in the urine and strain to urinate small amounts. Cardiac Heart arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat) Weakness Collapse The above symptoms are usually seen at home by pet parents and then reported to the veterinarian during an appointment. However, some cats with hypercalcemia have no symptoms, and the only way to detect this medical condition is for your veterinary professional to measure your cat's calcium level with a blood test during an annual exam. Cats can develop hypercalcemia due to several causes: I diopathic hypercalcemia: This medical condition is the most common cause. It means that after running numerous diagnostic tests, no cause for a cat's elevated calcium level can be found and all known medical conditions have been ruled out. Renal (kidney) disease: When a cat has severe kidney disease, the kidneys can no longer function properly, which leads to a cascade of unfortunate events. Ultimately, mineral deposits form within soft tissue, including the kidneys, leading to even poorer kidney function. The two most common cancers that cause hypercalcemia in cats are lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma . Other types of cancers such as mammary cancer, cancer within the anal sac, and multiple myeloma are less common. Primary hyperparathyroidism: Occasionally a benign or cancerous mass can develop in one or more parathyroid glands in a cat’s neck. A benign mass called a parathyroid adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism in cats. When a mass is present within the parathyroid gland, it overproduces parathyroid stimulating hormone (PTH) that controls calcium levels in the bloodstream. Whether it is benign or cancerous, excess PTH leads to resorption of bone and a release of extra calcium into the bloodstream, causing hypercalcemia. Hypoadrenocorticism: This endocrine disorder, also known as Addison’s disease, is very rare in cats and develops when the adrenal glands are unable to produce glucocorticoids (steroids) and mineralocorticoids. Cats with this condition are typically lethargic, lose weight, and have anorexia. Hypercalcemia can occasionally be seen in the bloodwork of a cat that has hypoadrenocorticism. Vitamin D toxicosis: Too much vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia. Cats can consume a toxic dose of the vitamin through diet or by ingesting rodenticide, a day-blooming jasmine plant, or eczema cream. Transient hypercalcemia: This is when a cat has dehydration due to lack of water or gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea). Once the dehydration and underlying cause are corrected, the calcium level returns to normal in most cases. Further diagnostics or treatment are not needed unless GI symptoms recur. Fungal infections: Cryptococcus neoformans , blastomycosis , histoplasmosis, and bacterial infections caused by atypical mycobacterium or Actinomyces spp. can cause hypercalcemia in cats. Depending on the cat and their health history, a veterinarian may use one or more of the following diagnostics to determine hypercalcemia in cats and how to treat it. Physical and rectal exams: A veterinarian can check for muscle wasting, muscle tremors, lethargy, decreased mobility, cancerous masses, enlarged lymph nodes, and an irregular heart beat. Bloodwork : A blood cell count (CBC), electrolytes, and chemistry panel that includes a total calcium level. If the total calcium level is elevated, an ionized calcium level is recommended to confirm if the hypercalcemia is clinically significant. Urinalysis: This is done to screen for kidney disease. Fine needle aspiration : A small needle is used to obtain cells from an enlarged lymph node to screen for lymphoma and other forms of cancer. Parathyroid hormone assay: This blood panel helps test for hyperparathyroidism by measuring the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the bloodstream. If the level of PTH is elevated in a cat that has hypercalcemia, then primary hyperparathyroidism is likely the cause of the elevated calcium level. Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein (PTHrP) Assay: This is another blood test that measures the amount of parathyroid hormone-related protein in the bloodstream. If a hypercalcemic cat has elevated PTHrP, then cancer is likely present and the cause for the hypercalcemia. Ultrasound of the neck: A board-certified radiologist examines the parathyroid glands and thyroid gland to see if a tumor is present. Abdominal ultrasound: It may be needed to screen for cancerous masses in the abdomen that can cause hypercalcemia. Advanced imaging: A CT scan or MRI screens for a cancerous mass that could be the cause of a cat's hypercalcemia. Bone marrow cytologic exam: This exam reviews cells within the bone marrow to screen for lymphoma and other forms of cancer. ACTH stimulation test: This blood test screens for hypoadrenocorticism. Fungal serology or culture: Tests used to determine if fungal infections are present. Bacterial culture: Used to check for bacterial infections. Vitamin D assay: A test used to determine if vitamin D toxicity is suspected. Determining the cause for hypercalcemia can be costly, due to the number of diagnostic tests that may be needed. Sometimes the cause is never found, which leads to a diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalcemia. Treatment for hypercalcemia depends upon the underlying cause. If a cause can be found and treated, then this should help to prevent future bouts of hypercalcemia. Also, cats showing signs of hypercalcemia and/or have a high calcium level require treatment to lower it. Treatment may involve: Fluid therapy: Intravenous fluids are needed to correct any dehydration, which is an important step because dehydration can worsen hypercalcemia. IV fluids are also helpful to clear the kidneys of excess calcium by excreting it into the urine. Diuretic medication: Furosemide may be needed to prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing calcium. It is crucial that the cat is always hydrated and has access to water. Without access to water, furosemide can cause a cat to become dehydrated. Steroid: Prednisolone reduces the ability for bone and the intestines to absorb calcium and helps the kidneys to excrete excess calcium into the urine. By doing so, this medication lowers the amount of calcium in the bloodstream. Alendronate: This is an oral medication that is often prescribed when a cat is diagnosed with idiopathic hypercalcemia. Alendronate reduces bone resorption of calcium and helps to slow down bone loss. Diet: A change in diet may be indicated for cats with idiopathic hypercalcemia. A canned diet should be given instead of a dry cat formula to promote hydration. There are prescription canned diets to choose from that have helped with decreasing calcium levels (GI and renal diets) or minimizing the risk for calcium oxalate bladder stones (urinary diets), such as: High-fiber gastrointestinal diet ( Royal Canin Gastrointestinal Fiber Response , Purina OM , or Hill’s w/d ) Renal diet ( Royal Canin Renal diets , Purina NF , or Hill’s k/d ) Urinary diet ( Royal Canin Urinary SO , Purina UR , Hill’s c/d ) After treatment has begun, your veterinarian will perform bloodwork to monitor the calcium level and determine the next steps of treatment. A cat that has previously had hypercalcemia can develop this condition again if the underlying cause is not identified and treated properly, or if treatment is not given as directed. Most causes of hypercalcemia develop out of our control and cannot be prevented. The key is to keep your cat hydrated and bring your cat to your local veterinarian for a physical exam and bloodwork (which includes a calcium level check) every 6-12 months to allow for early detection.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_chronic_kidney_failure,Hyperparathyroidism Due to Kidney Failure in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to chronic kidney failure is medically referred to as secondary hyperparathyroidism. More specifically, the cause of secondary hyperparathyroidism is absolute or relative lack of calcitriol production -- a form of vitamin D that stimulates the absorption of calcium in the intestines, calcium resorption in bone, and promotes the effectiveness of the parathyroid hormone in aiding bone resorption. Low concentrations of calcium also play a role in increased levels of PTH in blood. The majority of symptoms relate to the underlying cause of chronic kidney failure. In some patients with chronic kidney disease, bone resorption starts around the teeth and jaw, causing a loosening of the teeth and a softening of the lower jaw, a condition known in the medical community as “rubber jaw.” Any underlying disease that causes chronic kidney failure. You will need to give a detailed history of your cat's health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all of the body systems. Blood testing and biochemical profiles may reveal azotemia, an accumulation of toxic amounts of nitrogenous waste products (urea) in the blood, waste products that are usually excreted in the urine and voided from the body. This condition is also referred to as uremia. There may also be abnormally higher levels of the phosphate in the blood and abnormally low levels of the calcium in the blood. For definitive diagnosis, your veterinarian will perform measurements of serum PTH concentrations. Moreover, low to normal concentrations of calcium in the blood will help in confirming a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Bone X-rays are also helpful in determining bone density, especially around the teeth. Treating the underlying kidney disease is a major goal of therapy in patients that have been diagnosed with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Abnormally high levels of phosphorous in the blood is treated by using chemicals that bind to the excess phosphorous in the blood, and the diet is controlled to limit phosphorous ingestion by way of food. To overcome calcitriol deficiency, calcitriol is given to increase calcium levels, but in very small doses that are calculated by your veterinarian based on your cat's specific need. Depending on the severity of kidney failure, it is very important to check the serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorous and urea nitrogen weekly or monthly. If your cat is receiving calcitriol, you will need to closely monitor the cat's condition, as calcitriol therapy may lead to some untoward symptoms or complications. Your cat's parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations will also need to be checked on a regular basis.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_excess_parathyroid_hormone,Hyperparathyroidism in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hyperparathyroidism is medical condition in which abnormally high levels of parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone or PTH) are circulating in the blood as the result of an overactive parathyroid gland. The parathyroid hormone is responsible for regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from bone. The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands. The term para- refers to adjacent or alongside, and thyroid refers to the actual thyroid gland; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are located side by side in the neck, near the windpipe or trachea Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to a condition in which a tumor in the parathyroid gland produces excessive levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to increased blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia). Secondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a deficiency of calcium and vitamin D, and is associated with malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease. There is no known genetic cause for primary hyperparathyroidism, but its association with certain breeds suggests a possible hereditary basis in some cases. Secondary hyperparathyroidism can develop in association with hereditary kidney disease (known as hereditary nephropathy), but is not inherited per se. Siamese cats seem to show some predilection for this disease. In cats, the average age is 13 years, with a range of 8 to 15 years of age. Your veterinarian will be looking for cancer first and foremost for the cause for this disease. However, several other possibilities will also be considered, such as renal failure and vitamin D intoxication, which have been known to be found in some rodenticides. Other possibilities are too much calcium in the blood in cats. A urinalysis will reveal calcium and phosphate levels. Serum ionized calcium determination is often normal in patients with chronic renal failure and high in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia that is associated with a malignancy. If kidney stones are suspected, your veterinarian may use x-ray and ultrasound imaging of the parathyroid gland to discover whether there is tumor there. If nothing can be found using these diagnostic techniques, your veterinarian may need to use surgery to explore the area of the thyroid and parathyroid. Primary hyperparathyroidism generally requires inpatient care and surgery. Secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition or long-term (chronic) kidney disease in non-critical patients can be managed on an outpatient basis. Your veterinarian may recommend calcium supplements to stabilize the levels of calcium in the blood and intestines. Low phosphorus diets for secondary hyperparathyroidism related to long-term kidney disease may be recommended as well. Surgery is the treatment of choice for primary hyperparathyroidism and is often important in establishing the diagnosis. If a tumor is found, the best resolution is often surgical removal of the tumor. Medications will be prescribed according to the final diagnosis and treatment plan. No strategies exist for prevention of primary hyperparathyroidism; however, secondary hyperparathyroidism related to malnutrition can be prevented by proper nutrition. Postoperative low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia) is relatively common after surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands for treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients with presurgical calcium concentrations greater than 14 mg/d. Your veterinarian will want to check serum calcium concentrations once or twice daily for at least one week after surgery, and will schedule your cat for regular blood tests to check the status of the kidney.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_systemic_hypertension,Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) in Cats,"AnnaStills/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Hypertension in cats is more common in seniors than most pet parents realize. As cat blood pressure is affected by kidney and thyroid disease, cats with these conditions should have their blood pressure checked on a regular basis. While untreated high blood pressure often results in retinal detachment and sudden blindness, hypertension in cats can be readily managed with a daily pill. Hypertension in cats occurs when high blood pressure is present throughout the entirety of a feline’s body. When a cat’s heart contracts, it pushes blood throughout the body and creates pressure on the walls of the arteries. This pressure is called systolic blood pressure (SBP) . When the heart relaxes and fills with blood, the pressure on the artery walls is called diastolic blood pressure (DBP) . So, blood pressure is a measurement of the amount of pressure on the artery walls. A cat’s blood pressure is measured in the same way as a human’s, with the systolic number over the diastolic number, measured in millimeters of mercury, or mmHg. In cats, the diastolic blood pressure measurement (the bottom number), is less reliable and considered a less important component of hypertension. So, hypertension in cats is typically diagnosed based on an elevated systolic blood pressure (top number). Hypertension in cats is generally diagnosed when the SBP is greater than 160 mm Hg or if the SBP is greater than 150 mmHg and there is clear evidence of organ damage due to hypertension. Cats are hooked up to a blood pressure cuff, just like people. The cuff will tighten and the doctor will get a reading. A normal cat blood pressure should be under 150 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). Many cats are stressed while they’re in the hospital. Because of this stress, their blood pressure may be slightly elevated. Vets call this “white coat syndrome.” It’s not unusual to see cats with normal blood pressure outside the hospital, have more borderline hypertensive values in the 150-180 mmHg range. For these cats, the vet will often recommend continued monitoring and not starting medication right away. Your vet may want to give your cat a little time (about five to 10 minutes to calm down), have a treat and relax in the clinic. They may repeat the reading to see if they are still borderline, or if their blood pressure is coming down. Hypertension is usually diagnosed in cats with blood pressure readings over 180 mmHg. For these kitties, the vet will recommend treatment. Some pets may have no symptoms. If signs of hypertension in cats do appear, they may include: Fixed, dilated pupils Blood in the clear chamber of the eye Sudden blindness, bumping into objects Disorientation Stumbling, poor balance ( ataxia ) Back leg weakness Behavior changes, seeming “out of it” Seizures Decreased appetite Vomiting Weight loss In most cases, high blood pressure in cats is due to or associated with an underlying disease. This is called secondary hypertension . The two most common underlying conditions of hypertension in cats are: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common disease associated with hypertension in cats and is found in up to 74% of cats with hypertension. Hyperthyroidism , a disease caused by a tumor on the thyroid gland (usually benign), is also commonly present in cats with hypertension. Uncommon diseases that are linked to a higher risk of feline hypertension include: Hyperaldosteronism Hyperadrenocorticism ( Cushing’s disease ) Diabetes mellitus Pheochromocytoma These diseases are diagnosed most frequently in senior and geriatric cats. Certain medications—such as steroids (like prednisolone ) and phenylpropanolamine —may also lead to high blood pressure in cats. About 20% of cats have idiopathic hypertension, meaning that an underlying cause is unable to be found. A portion of these cats are likely in the very early stages of chronic kidney disease, before abnormalities can be detected by a vet. If you want to try and take your cat’s blood pressure at home, you’ll need a specialty veterinary monitor and an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff. At home monitors may not be as accurate as those used in the veterinary office, so be sure to have your vet double check if you’re getting concerning readings. The cuff should be approximately 40% of the limb’s circumference so that it’s snug, but not too tight. Veterinary cuffs often have an optimal zone on the back. Make sure your cat is calm and relaxed before you take the measurement so that it’s as accurate as possible. Position the cuff on the front leg, back leg, or tail with the sensor over the artery. Inflate the cuff (there will usually be a start button) and try to keep your pet as still as possible while the machine takes a reading. Normal : Less than 150 mmHg Prehypertension : 151-180 mmHg Hypertension : 181-200 mmHg Severe hypertension : Greater than 200 mmHg Hypertension in cats is treated with oral medications. Amlodipine is the medication of choice used to treat hypertension in cats. It comes in a pill form and is given orally once daily. If you have a hard time giving pills to your cat, your veterinarian may have the medication compounded into a liquid . The goal of hypertension treatment is to minimize the symptoms associated with organ damage and to reduce your cat’s blood pressure to less than 150 mmHg. In some cases, additional medications—such as ACE inhibitors or telmisartan —may be necessary. Aside from using medications to help lower your cat’s blood pressure, your veterinarian will need to run lab tests to detect any underlying diseases that contribute to hypertension. This typically includes blood work and urine testing . Pet parents do typically notice an improvement in their cat’s demeanor and energy levels after starting therapy for hypertension. However, if your cat had vision loss at the time of diagnosis, it may be a permanent consequence of hypertension. Since hypertension is often unnoticeable until it has been present long enough to cause significant organ damage, the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) recommends routine blood pressure screening for cats as follows: Healthy senior cats (7–10 years of age): every 12 months Healthy geriatric cats (11+ years of age) : every six to 12 months Cats with CKD, hypertension, or other diseases that increase the risk of hypertension, as well as those with signs of hypertensive organ damage : at time of diagnosis, and then every three to six months The prognosis for cats diagnosed with hypertension is good with regular treatment. Remember, blood pressure is managed rather than cured. Your cat will need regular checkups to ensure they’re on the correct dosage. A blood pressure reading over 180 mmHg is diagnostic for hypertension in cats. Yes, cats can live happy, healthy lives with hypertension when it’s treated. Untreated hypertension may lead to shortened lives. There is no natural treatment for high blood pressure in cats. Yes, high blood pressure can eventually lead to seizures in untreated cats. Yes, stress can increase a cat's blood pressure. When blood pressure is artificially increased in the vet’s office it is called “white coat syndrome.” This increase is usually mild.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hyperthyroidism,Hyperthyroidism in Cats: Symptoms and Treatment,"Tashi-Delek/E+ via Getty Images Is your senior cat losing weight and vomiting? Perhaps they’re a little more irritable and really starting to look their age. They may not just be “getting older.” It’s possible that they’re suffering from a common disease in cats, called hyperthyroidism. With treatment, you may be able to help them have a longer, healthier life. Hyperthyroidism in cats is a disease that’s usually caused by a benign tumor within the thyroid gland. This tumor causes an overproduction of the thyroid hormone called thyroxine. One of the primary functions of this thyroid hormone is to regulate an animal’s metabolism. Cats with too much thyroid hormone have a greatly increased metabolic rate, which leads them to lose weight despite having a ravenous appetite . These excessive hormone levels push a cat’s body into constant overdrive, which frequently leads to high blood pressure and a type of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Let’s look at everything you should know about hyperthyroidism in cats, so you can spot the signs and get your cat on a treatment plan as soon as possible. There is no known genetic predisposition for hyperthyroidism in cats, but it’s quite common. In fact, hyperthyroidism is the most common hormonal (endocrine) disease in the cat population, often seen in late middle-aged and older cats. The average age of diagnosis is approximately 13 years. The possible age range is 4–20 years, although seeing young hyperthyroid cats is very rare. Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Here are the major symptoms of hyperthyroidism that you should look for in your cat: Weight loss Increased appetite Unkempt appearance Poor body condition Vomiting Diarrhea Drinking more than usual Peeing more than usual Rapid/difficulty breathing Heart murmur ; rapid heart rate ; an abnormal heartbeat known as a “gallop rhythm” Hyperactivity/restlessness Aggression Enlarged thyroid gland, which feels like a lump on the neck Thickened nails There are several potential causes of hyperthyroidism in cats, such as: Benign adenoma , a non-cancerous tumor on the thyroid gland that doesn’t spread. This is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in cats and accounts for over 95% of hyperthyroidism cases. Thyroid cancer , like adenocarcinoma. Chronic exposure to thyroid-disrupter chemicals in the environment , like BPAs and PBDEs. These chemicals may be found in the plastic lining of food tins or in the fish-flavoring used by some cat food companies. Additionally, these chemicals are used in flame-retardants found in some furniture and carpeting. They circulate in household dust that cats groom off themselves. Diets that are too rich or deficient in iodine , selenium or soy isoflavones (a soy protein source) may contribute to the development of hyperthyroidism over time. Long term exposure to water sources contaminated with organic chemicals , herbicides or pesticides . To diagnose hyperthyroidism in cats, vets will look for high levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream (total T4 or TT4) in addition to other symptoms. In some cases, however, your cat’s T4 levels may be in the normal range, making a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism more difficult. This is especially true in the early stages of the disease. If your cat is showing the symptoms of hyperthyroidism but the blood tests are not conclusive, you will need to return to your veterinarian for further blood tests or for a referral for a thyroid scan. The signs of feline hyperthyroidism can also overlap with those of: Chronic renal failure Diabetes mellitus Chronic hepatic disease Cancer (especially intestinal lymphoma ) These diseases can be excluded based on routine laboratory findings and thyroid function tests. Your veterinarian will perform several tests to get a reliable diagnosis. Kidney disease is commonly diagnosed along with hyperthyroidism in cats. Cats suffering from both diseases may need treatment for both, and the diagnosis of kidney disease in a cat with hyperthyroidism can affect the cat’s prognosis. To treat hyperthyroidism in cats, a vet may recommend radioiodine treatment , which can cure the hyperthyroidism in most cases. Daily medication—like methimazole —or feeding a prescription low-iodine diet , like Hills Thyroid Care y/d , are good options when radioiodine therapy is not an option due to financial considerations or the cat’s overall health. Methimazole can be administered to cats orally, as a pill or liquid, or even be applied to their ear flap using a transdermal gel. Surgical removal of the diseased thyroid gland is another potential treatment. Like radioiodine treatment, surgical treatment is curative. However, cats also must be monitored afterward for hypothyroidism . Once treatment has begun, your vet will need to reexamine your cat every two to three weeks for the initial three months of treatment, for blood work to check their thyroid levels and to ensure their kidneys are tolerating the medication OK. Treatment will be adjusted based on the results, such as changing methimazole dosage to maintain thyroid hormone levels in the low-normal range. If your cat has had surgery, particularly removal of the thyroid gland, your veterinarian will want to closely observe your cat's physical recovery. Blood work and follow up exams are an important part of the post-operative period and are repeated for several months afterwards. Hyperthyroidism is a common disease affecting senior cats. With routine senior blood work, you can catch it quickly and initiate treatment. Treated cats can live long, happy lives. The prognosis is good for cats treated for hyperthyroidism. Most can return to a healthy lifestyle. Costs of treatment range dramatically depending on which option you select. Radioactive iodine is considered curative for many cats but usually runs several thousand dollars. Methimazole pills cost less than $20 per month but require daily medication. Talk to your vet to explore which option is best for your cat, your budget , and your lifestyle. Hyperthyroidism is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumor, so this isn’t something you can truly prevent. As there may be some environmental factors that play a role, there are several things you can alter in your cat’s lifestyle to reduce their risk, like: Avoiding plastics. Using foil pouches rather than plastic-lined tins. Minimizing how often you offer fish-flavored canned cat food. When heating or feeding food, always use glass or ceramic bowls. Filter all your cats drinking water and reduce their exposure to pesticides. Avoid diets rich in soy and deficient in selenium. Hyperthyroidism is likely a multifactorial disease, meaning there are lots of little things that can build up and increase their risk for developing the tumor.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/hyphema-cats-symptoms-and-treatment,Hyphema in Cats: Symptoms and Treatment,"SbytovaMN/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Hyphema in cats is when blood collects in the front of the eye. The eye is a complex organ with multiple connected and highly detailed parts that work together to let a cat see. Inside and surrounding the eye are many blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to the eye. When these vessels, specifically the retinal and/or uveal blood vessels, are damaged, blood spills into the anterior chamber, leading to hyphema. Hyphema may not always be a medical emergency, but it should always be treated as such because it is often caused by things like trauma, cancer , or clotting dysfunction and it can result in loss of vision . The most obvious symptom of hyphema in cats is a red eye. The degree of redness can vary, and it may show as a clot, settling of blood (redness) in the bottom half of the eye, or a general red/bloody eye . Additionally, along with hyphema, you may notice: Miosis (constricted, small pupil) Bluish haze to the cornea (edema) Inflamed conjunctiva (swollen membrane on eye and inner eyelids) Squinting or pawing at the eyes Swelling of the eye globe (buphthalmos) Blindness Hypopyon (inflammatory cells in the eye), often appears as a white opacity in the eye Signs of bleeding elsewhere in the body (i.e., melena, vomiting blood , bruising , or pin-point hemorrhages called petechiae) Anything that causes damage to the blood vessels within the eyes can lead to hyphema. The most common cause is trauma such as blunt force trauma, or a penetrating eye injury likely suffered from an animal attack. Other causes include: Uveitis Vasculitis such as that caused by tick-borne disease , toxoplasmosis , or FIP Hypertension (high blood pressure), either primary or secondary (attributed to kidney disease ) Tumors Clotting issues or coagulopathy, like those caused by rodenticide toxicity Glaucoma Immune-mediated disease Endocrine disease, such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism Secondary to lens luxation or retinal detachment Post-spay complications (typically mild and temporary) It’s easy to diagnose hyphema with a routine physical examination , but figuring out the underlying cause is, unfortunately, not as straightforward. A thorough ophthalmic (eye) examination is needed, with particular attention on eye reflexes; vision assessment; and evaluation of eye pressures (tonometry), corneal ulceration (fluorescein eye stain), and tear production (Schirmer tear test). More diagnostics your veterinarian will most likely want to do include: Blood work and urinalysis noting irregularities with kidney and liver values Thyroid profile Blood pressure measurement Tick titers or PCR testing for infectious disease FeLV , FIV , and heartworm testing Clotting profile (PT/PTT) in cases of suspected poisoning or clotting deficiencies Ocular ultrasound to check on the state of the retina, presence of tumor, or lens luxation Upon scheduling your veterinary appointment, please bring all prior medical histories including recent travel history, current and past parasite control, and any medications your cat is currently taking. Treatment for hyphema is twofold: therapy to treat the underlying cause (such as surgery, chemotherapy, antibiotics, or blood transfusion) and therapy directed at the eye itself to lower pain and inflammation (swelling). In complicated cases, referral to an ophthalmologist may be needed. Anti-inflammatory eye drops, such as flurbiprofen or diclofenac , or steroids like prednisolone acetate are helpful to control the secondary swelling as well as prevent the bleed from getting worse. Additionally, atropine eye drops help dilate the eye to reduce pain. For some cats, an injection into the eye with TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) can be done to help break up the clot. Pain medications and systemic steroids or NSAIDs, like Onsior , may also be given. Cats who develop glaucoma or other conditions as a complication of hyphema require lifelong medication. In severe cases, enucleation (removal) of the eye may be needed. The overall outlook for cats with hyphema varies and is often related to the underlying disease. But the outlook is generally good if you get early and aggressive treatment for it, especially to save the cat’s vision. Full recovery may take several weeks if uncomplicated. Recurrent or chronic hyphema carries a worse outlook as secondary glaucoma and phthisis bulbi (shrinkage of the globe) or cataract formation and posterior synechiae (the iris sticking to the lens) may happen. Unfortunately, not all causes of hyphema can be prevented. There are, however, a few recommendations that can decrease your cat’s likelihood of getting the condition: Routine physical examinations, including blood work screening for infectious disease and endocrine disease Routine deworming and heartworm prevention. Talk to your vet about getting our cat on a heartworm preventative like Revolution Plus , Nexgard Combo, or Interceptor . Treatment for hyphema in cats will vary since there are different underlying causes. Some need surgery, and others may require blood transfusions or medications. Hyphema itself is typically treated with NSAIDs or steroids and atropine eye drops. For uncomplicated cases, hyphema can go away on its own, but it typically takes a week or more. Make sure to take your pet to the vet if you suspect hyphema in your cat. In some cases, hyphema is recurrent or can last for multiple weeks. Given the multiple causes of hyphema, if you notice blood in your cat’s eye(s), you need to take him to the veterinarian. Aggressive and early treatment may help save your cat’s vision. Schenk et al.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/hypoglycemia-low-blood-sugar-cats,Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) in Cats,"Blood sugar, or glucose, is the main source of energy for both the body and the brain. Low levels of blood glucose, called hypoglycemia, will deprive the body and brain of energy, resulting in unconsciousness. If left untreated, it can lead to death. The opposite condition, high blood glucose levels, is often a sign of diabetes mellitus . Hypoglycemia is the most common side effect of insulin administration for the treatment of diabetes. The effects of insulin are long-lasting (working for hours), so complications from an overdose will worsen with time, and a pet can progress from stable to critical condition very quickly. As noted, if left untreated, hypoglycemia can be fatal to your cat. Weakness Lethargy/depression Vomiting Blindness Lack of coordination/stumbling Anxiety Seizures Coma Death Cats under treatment for diabetes are at a higher risk for developing hypoglycemia. Mistakes that can be made when administering insulin include: Giving too much insulin Using a mismatched needle and syringe Missing or delaying meals Change in the diet or amount fed Change in time of insulin administration Other causes of hypoglycemia in cats that are unrelated to the administration of insulin for diabetic patients include: Infection or illness Decreased appetite or vomiting Change in the body’s need for insulin Concurrent hormonal disease Interaction of insulin with other medications Increase in activity Heatstroke Liver disease Kidney disease Remission of diabetes Hypoglycemia can be easily diagnosed in the hospital. A blood glucose level check will reveal a lower-than-normal blood glucose level. In combination with your cat’s history and clinical signs at the hospital, a diagnosis can be made for hypoglycemia. To determine the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia, a thorough history and review of the insulin administration is required. If inappropriate administration does not appear to be the cause of the hypoglycemia, the following tests may be performed: Blood Chemistry Profile: to assess the health and function of the liver, kidneys, and pancreas Complete Blood Count: to identify abnormal red and white blood cell counts and patterns, which could identify an underlying disease such as anemia, dehydration, or infection Urinalysis: to evaluate kidney function and check for a urinary tract infection Cortisol Test: to reveal abnormalities in the body’s stress hormone, which could affect its ability to metabolize insulin Thyroid Test: to evaluate the amount of thyroid hormone Imaging: X-rays and ultrasounds are used to check for tumors, abscesses, infection in the abdomen, liver shunts, and liver abnormalities Initially, treatment is aimed at raising low blood glucose levels. Depending on the severity of the blood glucose level and the clinical signs at the time of the diagnosis, treatment can vary to include: Oral Options at Home: If you notice any symptoms of hypoglycemia (as listed above), take your cat to the hospital immediately. For transport to the hospital, pet parents can apply Karo® corn syrup or honey to the gums only. (Do not force anything to be swallowed or into the mouth.) When you arrive at the hospital, be sure to inform the staff of any home treatments you started. It is important to note that hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can produce similar signs in cats (stupor, depression, lethargy), so without confirmation of low blood glucose levels, or a known insulin overdose, do not apply more Karo syrup or honey to the gums in diabetic patients. Oral Options at the Hospital: Similar to options at home, a source of glucose is applied to the gums. In the hospital, cats are monitored for changes in their clinical signs and improving blood glucose levels. If levels are very low or cats are not responding to the gum application, an intravenous administration is typically started. Intravenous (IV): The application of glucose to the gums is not as effective as intravenous dextrose. A continuous-rate infusion is beneficial for cats that do not respond to an initial IV dextrose injection. Supportive Care: In severe cases of hypoglycemia, appropriate nutrition and warming are needed. Seizures are treated with anticonvulsant medication. Once the patient is stable, further investigation of the cause of the hypoglycemia can be performed. The clinical signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia should improve within minutes of treatment. In cases of a large insulin overdose, however, repeated treatments are needed over time to counteract the long-lasting action of insulin. In those cases, cats may be kept in the hospital for a continuous infusion of dextrose. Pet parents of a cat with diabetes should always have a source of glucose and a blood glucose monitor readily available to treat confirmed hypoglycemia following an insulin overdose. After an administration of glucose alleviates the obvious signs of hypoglycemia and a cat can eat on their own, small amounts of food should be offered every 1-2 hours until the effects of the insulin overdose have been counteracted. Ways to decrease hypoglycemia from an insulin overdose include: Maintain strict feeding times (same times each day) Administer insulin near the time of eating Avoid changes in the diet/food (including treats) Schedule routine bloodwork monitoring as suggested Provide a consistent level of exercise and play each day Keeping in mind the symptoms of hypoglycemia in cats and ways to decrease hypoglycemia from an insulin overdose, you’ll be best prepared to keep your cat safe.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/hypokalemia-cats,Hypokalemia in Cats,"YanaVasileva/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Hypokalemia in cats is the medical term for low levels of potassium in the blood. Potassium is an electrolyte that is important for many of your cat’s essential life functions, from sending signals between nerves to maintaining your cat’s heartbeat. Small changes in potassium levels can have significant impacts on the function of your cat’s muscles and nerves. Cats with hypokalemia often act weak and fatigued , and they may hang their head downward. Hypokalemia causes muscle pain and weakness, which is uncomfortable for cats. Significant elevations in potassium are life-threatening. While studies haven’t established a relationship between low blood potassium levels and mortality in cats, some of the conditions that cause hypokalemia can be fatal. If you are concerned that your cat has hypokalemia, call your veterinarian immediately. Symptoms of hypokalemia in cats include: Muscle weakness, potentially muscle paralysis Limb pain Head hanging downward (limp neck) Acting fatigued or mentally dull Drinking and urinating a lot (polydipsia and polyuria) Constipation Abnormal heart rhythm Shallow breathing Keep in mind that hypokalemia often occurs secondary to another condition, so your cat could have other symptoms related to the main cause. Hypokalemia in cats usually occurs due to a loss of potassium that happens alongside another health condition. Causes that fall under this category include: Chronic and/or severe vomiting Chronic and/or severe diarrhea Chronic kidney disease (CKD) Hyperaldosteronism due to abnormal growth of adrenal glands (rare) It’s possible for cats to have hypokalemia due to low potassium intake, such as if they’re starved or fed a diet low in potassium. Always feed your cat appropriate amounts of a balanced diet formulated for cats. If your cat has a poor appetite or isn’t eating, contact your veterinarian. A cat of any breed or age can develop hypokalemia, but some of the potential causes are more common in specific ages or breeds of cats. For example, hypokalemia due to CKD is more common in senior cats. One hereditary condition caused by a genetic mutation is called hypokalemic periodic polymyopathy, and is more common in these cat breeds: Burmese Bombay Tonkinese Diagnosis of hypokalemia requires a blood sample. The normal blood tests that your veterinarian runs usually include potassium levels. If your cat’s potassium level is lower than normal (3.5 mEq/L), they will be diagnosed with hypokalemia. Additional diagnostics might include urinalysis (testing urine) or imaging to try to figure out what is causing the low potassium. Other electrolyte levels, such as sodium and chloride, will be looked at as well. Share with your veterinarian if you’ve noticed any of the following: Your cat is drinking more water than usual. Your cat is peeing more than usual or having accidents . Your cat has been vomiting. Your cat is having diarrhea. Your cat hasn’t been eating or is uninterested in food. Treatment of hypokalemia in cats will focus on the underlying cause. For example, a cat with chronic kidney disease should go on a kidney diet and may need additional fluid supplementation. A cat with hypokalemia due to chronic vomiting should have the cause of vomiting diagnosed and treated, but when it comes to the hypokalemia itself, your veterinarian can supplement potassium to increase your cat’s levels. In severe cases or when your cat is acutely ill, this can include adding potassium to fluids given intravenously (IV). If your hypokalemic cat is hospitalized, this is a common way to supplement potassium. If your cat has a chronically low potassium, your veterinarian may recommend supplementing additional potassium orally. Potassium gluconate in the form of a gel or powder is common. Your veterinarian will tell you how much and how often to give potassium gluconate, but it’s usually two to three times per day. Some cases of hypokalemia in cats will resolve as the cat recovers from the underlying cause. For example, a cat who is hypokalemic from vomiting will usually return to normal potassium levels once they stop vomiting and start eating a normal, healthy diet. Outside of managing the cause, you may not need to take any extra steps. While your cat is in the hospital, their potassium levels may be measured several times a day. However, some cases of hypokalemia will require lifelong management. For instance, a cat with chronic kidney disease will be on a renal diet and may need potassium supplementation for life. While your cat’s potassium levels may return to normal with supplementation , frequent rechecks will be needed and hypokalemia will develop again if you stop the supplements. To prevent hypokalemia, seek veterinary attention for chronic vomiting or diarrhea. Keep your cat on preventives to protect them from parasites that could cause vomiting or diarrhea. Take your cat to their regular wellness exams , which should include lab work if recommended by your veterinarian. Young and mature adult cats should see their veterinarian at least once a year, while senior cats should see the veterinarian at least twice annually.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/hypothermia-cats,Hypothermia in Cats,"Cats run a little hotter than we do, with a normal body temperature of 100 degrees F to 102.5 degrees F. Hypothermia in cats is when their body temperature falls below normal , or under 100 degrees F. With mild hypothermia, a cat’s blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate initially increase. However, as hypothermia progresses, all three decreases. Lack of adequate blood flow and oxygen can lead to heart arrhythmias and, in severe cases, death. You may not readily notice mild hypothermia. If your cat is shivering, it means their body is actively working to combat hypothermia. However, if your cat is cold to the touch and acting excessively tired, or if your cat isn’t responsive, this is an emergency. Take your cat to the nearest emergency veterinarian. Hypothermia is more common in kittens, senior cats, and cats who go outdoors. A cat of any breed can develop hypothermia, though healthy cats usually don’t develop this condition. You may have an image in your mind of what a person with hypothermia looks like. Well, some of the same symptoms occur in cats. Symptoms of hypothermia in cats include: Shivering Weakness or lethargy Collapse or coma Being cold to the touch Fast breathing with mild hypothermia and slow breathing with severe hypothermia Low blood pressure (detected by a veterinarian) Abnormal heart rhythms (detected by a veterinarian) There are several circumstances that can lead to hypothermia in cats, including: Exposure to freezing temperatures, especially wet and windy conditions Recovering from or undergoing an anesthetic procedure Medical conditions like heart disease , kidney disease , or sepsis Head trauma To diagnose hypothermia in cats, your veterinarian will simply take your cat’s temperature. Insertion of the thermometer into the rectum is the preferred method. Providing your veterinarian with your cat’s recent activities and relevant medical history is crucial for making an appropriate diagnosis of the cause of the hypothermia. You can help your veterinarian by sharing any of the following information: Has your cat been outside recently? Was your cat bathed recently? Does your cat have any known medical conditions, particularly heart disease, kidney disease, or a recent infection? The veterinarian will run several lab tests to monitor your cat’s overall health. They will want to rule out anemia and make sure your cat’s blood sugar level is normal. They may also perform an electrocardiogram (ECG), which is a test that allows your vet to look at your cat’s heart rhythm. If there is concern about other medical conditions like heart disease, additional tests such as an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) may be recommended. The primary goal of treating hypothermia is to get your cat’s body temperature back to normal. Several methods exist for rewarming your cat. External rewarming includes wrapping your cat in blankets, applying warm water bags, and using heating pads or other warming devices like Bair Huggers ™. Warming devices should always be separated from the cat by towels or blankets to prevent burns . In severe cases, internal rewarming may be performed. This involves putting warmed fluid into a cat’s stomach, rectum, or abdomen. IV fluids will also be warmed prior to administration. Internal rewarming should only be performed by veterinary staff . Cats with hypothermia due to severe heart disease may not be given IV fluids because it could overload their heart. Abnormal heart rhythms in hypothermic cats don’t generally respond well to the medications that veterinarians would otherwise use to treat them. These arrhythmias generally improve on their own as body temperature increases. The veterinarian will keep an ECG on a cat to monitor their heart rhythm during recovery. Unconscious patients may need to have a tube placed in their trachea to help them breathe and to prevent aspiration if they vomit. Supplemental oxygen can be administered through this endotracheal tube. Cats who are going to recover will usually return to their normal body temperature within several hours. In moderate to severe cases, your veterinarian may want to keep your cat in the hospital for a day or two to monitor their recovery. If your cat has an underlying health condition like heart disease contributing to their hypothermia, lifelong management will be necessary. Your veterinarian will work with you to develop the best management plan for your pet. In some severe cases, the damage is too severe and the cat will not recover. Cats who have hypothermia due to exposure to freezing temperatures should also be checked for frostbite . Heated beds may help keep your cat comfortable at home. Be cognizant that some heated beds come with cords that are chewing hazards , and others present burn risks if your cat uses them unmonitored. Make sure to follow any safety recommendations and instructions that are provided when you purchase a heated bed. To prevent hypothermia in cats, the best thing pet parents can do is keep their cats indoors. If your cat must go outside, ensure you are providing a shelter away from wind and precipitation . We also recommend regular veterinary wellness appointments to monitor for predisposing health conditions.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hypothyroidism,Hypothyroidism in Cats,"Hypothyroidism in cats is a lack of thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism in cats is rare and can be divided into two categories: congenital (present at birth) and acquired . The most common scenario is when a cat that has hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) has treatment that overcorrects and then causes them to have (acquired) hypothyroidism. Congenital hypothyroidism is a rare form that is present in kittens at birth. The thyroid hormone is important for the development of the nervous and skeletal systems. Kittens that lack this hormone will have related symptoms, such as mental dullness and smaller than normal proportions. Acquired hypothyroidism in cats is a lack of thyroid hormone in adult cats, which is also very rare. Acquired hypothyroidism can further be divided into three categories: primary hypothyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism, and iatrogenic hypothyroidism . Each type has a different cause. Primary hypothyroidism is thought to result from either an immune-mediated disorder that destroys thyroid tissue, such as lymphocytic thyroiditis, or from thyroid gland atrophy, a shrunken and shriveled gland that does not function properly. Secondary hypothyroidism has only been reported in one cat that suffered head trauma, which caused a decrease in the production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) by the pituitary gland. Iatrogenic hypothyroidism can often occur in cats that are being treated for hyperthyroidism , which is the overproduction of thyroid hormone. Surgery or radioactive iodine therapy to regulate overactive hormone production can sometimes leave cats with the opposite problem: their levels of thyroid hormone are now too low. This will cause irreversible hypothyroidism in your cat, but it can be managed. Your cat can also have iatrogenic hypothyroidism if you are treating them with methimazole (in a pill or transdermal gel) as the veterinarian tries to find the right dose for your cat. However, this is reversible over several months after finding the right dose. The symptoms you’ll see depend on the type of hypothyroidism your cat has. Kittens with congenital hypothyroidism can display the following symptoms: Mental dullness Small size compared to their littermates Abnormal body proportions, such as a large and wide head, enlarged tongue, and short limbs Lethargy Wobbly, drunken gait (also known as ataxia) Dry skin Thin fur Cats with acquired hypothyroidism may display the following signs: Lethargy Excessive weight gain Lack of appetite Dry, dull coat Hair loss Scaly skin The causes of hypothyroidism in cats are also dependent on the type. Causes of congenital hypothyroidism can be divided into goitrous and nongoitrous forms. Goitrous refers to the enlargement of the thyroid gland. Goitrous congenital hypothyroidism is thought to be caused by an inherited defect or dietary issues with iodine in the pregnant mother cat or newborn kitten. Nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism is usually caused by incomplete thyroid organ development. Congenital feline hypothyroidism has been seen in domestic shorthair cats as well as Abyssinian cats. Adult-onset acquired hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by iatrogenic hypothyroidism. This condition occurs when a cat’s treatment for hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) results in an underactive thyroid. Finding the balance an individual cat needs and anticipating their body’s response to therapy can be challenging. Diagnosis of hypothyroidism in cats requires blood samples to be drawn and put through a specific test called a thyroid panel. A feline thyroid panel consists of multiple measurements. In a cat with hypothyroidism, their total T4 measurement is usually low. However, certain medications as well as a syndrome called euthyroid sick could also be responsible for lowering your cat’s total T4, so additional testing may be required. This additional testing may consist of a blood sample for measuring free T4 (not bonded to your cat’s blood protein, which means the T4 is able to penetrate body tissues), T3, and TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). In kittens with congenital hypothyroidism, X-rays may reveal bony changes. The thyroid hormone is essential for normal development of a kitten’s skeletal and nervous systems, so a lack of the hormone leads to changes seen in these systems. Your veterinarian may also see high cholesterol and anemia on a complete blood count and chemistry panel. While these issues are not unique to a diagnosis of hypothyroidism, seeing them in your cat may lead your vet to order more specific tests, including thyroid measurements. Treatment for hypothyroidism in cats is aimed at restoring normal blood levels of thyroid hormone. This is typically managed by giving an oral thyroid medication supplement, in either liquid or tablet form. The drug sodium levothyroxine is usually given twice daily. Some cats may also require a second medication, called synthetic sodium liothyronine (L-T3). Cats with congenital and acquired hypothyroidism (primary, secondary, and iatrogenic from surgery or radioactive iodine) will have to be on medication forever. But cats with acquired iatrogenic hypothyroidism from too high of a dose of oral or transdermal methimazole can usually be treated by adjusting the dose. The goal of oral medication for hypothyroidism in cats is to improve the clinical signs of the disease. Follow-up bloodwork is important to assess the absorption and appropriate dosing of medication. An overdose of medication can have significant consequences, so your cat’s blood levels of T4 are an important indicator of appropriate regulation. In cats with acquired iatrogenic hypothyroidism after treatment for hyperthyroidism, additional follow-up testing—including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis—is recommended. With some of these cats (that were given oral or transdermal medication for hyperthyroidism), hypothyroidism can be reversed when your vet finds the ideal dosage of long-term hyperthyroid medication for your cat. Cats that were treated for hyperthyroidism with permanent treatments like surgery or radioactive iodine that led to hypothyroidism will need the long-term oral thyroid hormone. Acquired hypothyroidism , which affects adult cats, is rarely fatal. However, hypothyroidism can lower the kidney glomerular filtration rate, which is a measure of how well your cat’s kidneys are working to filter waste. If a cat has chronic renal (kidney) disease in addition to hypothyroidism, the combined effect of these factors can lead to severe azotemia or renal failure, which is fatal in cats. Congenital hypothyroidism , which is present at birth, can be fatal in kittens. Kittens with congenital hypothyroidism have an unknown prognosis. As this is a rare disease for cats, not much research exists for survival rates. Individual kitten survival depends on the severity of changes in their skeleton and nervous system. Adult cats with acquired hypothyroidism have a good prognosis with management of their disease and can achieve a nearly normal life expectancy. The side effects of untreated hypothyroidism can be painful. In kittens with congenital hypothyroidism , pain and discomfort can arise from the lameness associated with the illness. Discomfort for adult cats with untreated acquired hypothyroidism can arise from the following: Inflammation from excessive weight gain or abnormal skin barriers Dehydration from lowered kidney function or chronic renal disease Buildup of toxins in the bloodstream Nausea Weakness and a general feeling of being unwell Cats with hypothyroidism should be fed a high-quality diet as recommended by their veterinarian. Some hypothyroid kittens require a growth formula to help them gain weight, while some hypothyroid adult cats may require a weight-management formula to help them lose weight.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/c_ct_paraphimosis_phimosis,Inability to Protrude or Retract Penis in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Paraphimosis is a condition that causes the cat to be unable to retract its penis back into the sheath. Phimosis, on the other hand, refers to the cat's inability to protrude its penis from its outer orifice. Both of these medical conditions can occur in male dogs and cats at any age. If you would like to learn more about how paraphimosis and phimosis affect dogs please visit this page in the PetMD pet health library. The cat's inability to protrude its penis may go unnoticed until it tries to copulate with a female. Also, if the cat is having trouble urinating, it may be a sign of this medical disorder. If the animal experiences problems retracting its penis into the sheath, you may notice it licking the exterior of its penis. If it occurs over a prolonged period, there could also be fluid accumulation in the tissues (edema) or swelling in the area. The inability to retract the penis (paraphimosis) often occurs when the cat has a small opening (orifice), and in many cases is a birth defect. If the cat is unable to protrude the penis (phimosis), it may have swelling, or hairs that are obstructing the penis. In some cases, injury or a neurological disease can cause this medical condition. With paraphimosis, the veterinarian will be able to view the exposed penis and/or gland areas upon examination. The goal is to identify the underlying medical cause for the condition for treatment options. In some instances surgery can help enlarge the opening of the sheath (orifice), making it possible for the penis to protrude. Also, veterinarians can remove tissue surrounding the penile area to allow for a normal, functioning penis. Immediate treatment is necessary for cat that are unable to retract its penis into the sheath, as damage to the tissues can occur. Techniques to repair or aid in this medical condition can include removing any foreign objects that are present, lubricating the penile area for retraction, surgical enhancement of the orifice area if it is too small, and catheters if the cat is unable to urinate. At times, ointments and topical medications are prescribed to correct phimosis. With treatment, both conditions have a positive prognosis. However, cats that are unable to retract their penis into the shaft need immediate medical attention, as there are several complications that can occur if the penis is left outside of the body for extended periods of time. There are currently no known preventative methods for either medical condition. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_hypermetria_dysmetria,Incoordination of the Legs in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Dysmetria and hypermetria describe the incoordination of an animal's limbs during voluntary movement. More specifically, dysmetria is characterized by a cat's inability to judge the rate, range, and force of its movements -- literally, an inability to measure space. Hypermetria, meanwhile, describes the action of overreaching, or high stepping, the intended location. Signs of cerebellar disease that may be present include: Trauma to the brain or back is often the primary cause for spinal or brain injury, leading to incoordination or overreaching of the limbs. Lesions on the cerebellum, the part of the brain that is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements and balance, or on the nerves leading to the cerebellum, are believed to be one of the causes for these symptoms. Lesions can be caused by strokes, or by tumors located near these nerves. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. If there are no other signs of cerebellar disease, it will be important to establish whether a high-stepping thoracic limb gait is physically normal for your cat. Diagnostic imaging, such as with X-ray or ultrasound, is generally performed to review possible injury or damage to the brain and spine, and is especially recommended for older animals. Your veterinarian will check your cat's reactions and responses to stimulus, such as whether your cat responds when your veterinarian stabs a finger toward the its eyes. The reflexive closing of the eyes and jerking away is called the menace response, or menace reflex, and the lack of such of a response is indicative of loss of eye sight, or neurological dysfunction. If the condition is severe and/or rapidly progressive, hospitalization is recommended for an immediate diagnostic work-up and treatment. If the condition is mild or slowly progressive, treatment is often done on an outpatient basis. Generally, cats that are suffering from this condition are confined to ensure that they are not at risk of being injured while they are healing. You will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally. You may consider cage rest for a short time, if it is difficult to keep your cat confined to one place. However, it is important that your cat is not left alone for extended times, as this can be a very stressful time for the cat, and being alone for too long can make the stress, and the healing, worse for the cat. It is recommended that periodic neurologic examinations be performed to monitor your cat's progress. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_ventricular_tachycardia,Increased Heart Rate Due to Premature Contractions in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a potentially life-threatening disease of the heart that causes arrhythmia, an abnormally fast heartbeat. This may be due to an underlying heart disease, a metabolic disease, or an electrolyte imbalance. Ventricular tachycardia can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the ventricles (the bottom two heart chambers) become disorganized, contracting chaotically. This state can result in asystole – a sudden lack of electrical activity in the heart – and sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia may occur in structurally normal hearts, as hereditary arrhythmias, or may be a consequence of myocardial abnormalities associated with cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), significant valvular disease, or myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation). To date, there is no medical therapy available that is known to prevent sudden death in cats afflicted with ventricular tachycardia arrhythmias. If your cat is unstable, your doctor will apply treatment based on the symptoms before diagnosing the cause of the ventricular tachycardia. (See the treatment section below.) If your cat is stable, your veterinarian will begin with a complete physical exam of your cat. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The electrolyte panel will show if there is hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The bloodwork may show evidence of pancreatitis and hyperthyroidism. An electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction (which underlies the heart’s ability to contract/beat), and an echocardiogram (ultrasound imaging for the heart) will be performed to check for structural heart disease. A long-term ambulatory (portable) electrocardiograph recording of the heart's electrical activity, using a Holter monitor, can be used for detecting temporary ventricular arrhythmias in patients with unexplained syncope or weakness. The Holter can be especially useful for animals, since it can be worn as a vest, allowing the animal freedom of normal movement, which, when taken into account with a diary kept (by the pet caretaker) while the monitor is being worn, can give your veterinarian a reference frame for when the heartbeat irregularities are most likely to occur. If your cat is stable, electrolyte abnormalities will be corrected using fluid administration. Echocardiogram and use a 24-Holter to establish a true baseline of the arrhythmia quantity and quality. If the cat is unstable (inactive and lying down, weak, or frequent fainting), immediate intravenous treatment in a hospital setting with continuous ECG monitoring may be required. Once the arrhythmia is controlled and your cat's blood pressure has stabilized, oral medication should be started. The medication will be based on your cat's overall health, and how well your cat is able to tolerate the episodes of VT and how frequently they occur. Medications may be given to suppress future episodes. A follow-up 24-hour Holter will be required to test the efficacy of the anti-arrhythmic medication. Unfortunately, cats with ventricular tachycardia can sometimes die suddenly. Your veterinarian will schedule subsequent follow-up appointments with you for your cat as necessary to try to avoid this possibility. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_arthritis_septic,Infectious Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) in Cats,"Infectious arthritis in cats is a type of arthritis caused by bacteria (or some other infectious agent) entering the joints, which results in painful inflammation. This is different from noninfectious arthritis, which, for example, can be caused by the erosion of cartilage between joints ( osteoarthritis ) or by an autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis). Infectious arthritis in cats most commonly affects the wrist (carpus), ankle (hock), knee, and the hip joints. It is often due to an infection that spread from another part of the body. When an infectious agent enters a joint, it damages both the bone and the cartilage and can also affect other structures in the area, namely ligaments, tendons, and muscle. While infectious arthritis is common in dogs, it is rare in cats. It can affect a single joint or multiple joints (called polyarthritis). In general, this condition is not contagious among pets nor can it be shared with people. This type of arthritis is not an immediately life-threatening emergency, but your cat should be examined by her veterinarian as soon as possible if any signs develop, such as limping. The chances for recovery increase the faster treatment can begin. The main signs of infectious arthritis include heat, swelling, and pain in one or more joints. Signs can present either as an acute (rapid) or chronic (gradual) process. In addition, septic arthritis can cause: Decreased range of motion Limping, lameness Lethargy Stiff gait Fever Decreased or lack of appetite Any trauma that punctures a joint, such as a wounds or even a surgical procedure done on a joint, can result in infectious arthritis. The regular non-infectious arthritic process, osteoarthritis, and even joint injections to treat it can cause infectious arthritis. Infection occurs when foreign material, such as viruses, bacteria, and funguses, enter the joint space. Some causes include: Feline calicivirus and fungal organisms Cats with compromised immune systems, or those taking immune-suppressing medications Chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus Blood-borne infections, which can travel from the blood and infect the joint If your vet suspects your cat has infectious arthritis, they will perform a complete physical exam, take a thorough history, including asking about past injuries and illnesses that could have initiated the arthritis. They will take a blood sample to look for evidence of infection and/or inflammation. In early cases, the vet may see an increased amount of joint fluid on an x-ray of the affected limb as an indication of a current infection. X-rays are also helpful in chronic or long-term cases to reveal signs of degenerative joint disease (DJD), such as changes to the bones or irregular joint spaces. An arthrocentesis, or sampling of the joint fluid, will also be performed to look for infection and inflammatory cells. The fluid will be cultured to determine what infectious agent (bacteria, virus, or fungus) is present. The fluid culture will also be used to determine the best medications to treat the specific infection. Serologic blood testing (which checks for antibodies in the blood) can be done to look for evidence of tick-borne disease. If your cat has been diagnosed with infectious arthritis, your vet will recommend hospitalizing your cat. She will be treated with IV antibiotics and injectable pain medications until comfortable and stable enough to continue to be treated at home. IV fluids and other supportive care will be provided to help reduce fever and stimulate appetite. In some cases, it is possible that your vet might want to lavage the affected joint. This procedure will flush the joint with a sterile solution to help minimize joint damage. In severe cases, the patient will require surgery to open the joint, remove any abnormal tissue, and lavage the area to facilitate the healing process. If your cat’s condition is diagnosed within 24-48 hours, her response to antibiotic therapy should result in a good recovery. Once your cat is home after the diagnosis and stabilization, your vet will usually recommend long-term management, such as icing and rest. Icing the joint helps increase blood flow and decrease inflammation. Your vet will recommend that you restrict your cat’s activity to avoid putting pressure on the healing joint. This can be accomplished by keeping your cat in a small room (or even a large crate) where she cannot jump. Your cat should still have enough room to move around, eat and drink, and have a litter box to go to the bathroom. Use a shallow litter pan so your cat does not have to exert herself to use it. Medications will likely be prescribed for 4-8 weeks and include antibiotics and pain medication. Monitor your cat’s joints for heat, swelling, and pain, as bacterial or fungal agents can come back since your cat is now predisposed to the condition. This is important because the quicker the diagnosis, the better the chance of recovery.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/reproductive/c_ct_infertility_female,Infertility in Female Cats,"PetMD Editorial Normal fertility in a cat, and the ability to reproduce kittens, requires a normal estrous cycle, with a healthy reproductive tract, normal ova (eggs), normal and stable levels of reproductive hormones, fertilization by normal spermatozoa, implantation of an embryo in the lining of the uterus (endometrium), normal placenta placement, and stable levels of progesterone concentration. These conditions must be maintained for the entirety of the two month gestational period, or the process of reproduction will be altered, with resultant infertility. Some of the common symptoms that appear in cats that are unable to reproduce are abnormal cycling, failure to conceive, failure to copulate/mate, normal copulation without subsequent pregnancy, and/or pregnancy loss. Infertility can affect cats of all ages, but tends to be more common among older cats. Cats that have had previous uterine infections can also have subsequent difficulties with implantation. However, one of the most causes of seeming infertility is insemination during the improper time in the estrous cycle. Other conditions that may play a role in the cat's ability to reproduce include: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. There are several diagnostic tests that can be conducted in order to find out if the symptoms are related to the infertility disorder. Some of the basis for the diagnosis will be related to whether your cat has conceived or given birth in the past. If she has reproduced successfully before, your veterinarian will consider whether the male mate that has been chosen for breeding is of proven fertility, or whether the timing for the breeding was scheduled in accordance with your cat's ovulation cycle. Your cat's hormone levels will be analyzed, to be sure that she has the required levels for conception and a following pregnancy. Progesterone concentration must remain steady throughout the pregnancy for it to be successful. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests will show evidence of infections, either bacterial, viral, or parasitic. Viral infections that will be tested for include toxoplasmosis, protozoal parasite infection, herpesvirus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and hypercorticolism. In addition, your doctor will be checking your cat's body thoroughly for any other chronic disease conditions. Imaging techniques may be used to look for any abnormalities in the uterus, such as masses (indicating tumors), and anatomic abnormalities that would interfere with conception. In a healthy cat, the ovaries and uterus will not be visible on X-ray imaging. If your veterinarian is able to view the ovaries or uterus, this would suggest that there may be an underlying condition of ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine cysts. If it appears, on examination, that your cat has cysts or other masses of tissue in the uterus or reproductive tract, your veterinarian will need to take a sample of tissue from the uterus for biopsy. Improper breeding is most often at the root of the perceived infertility. To prevent this, the male tom cat may be bred to another queen to test his ability to impregnate. Your doctor may also advise you to change the amount of light your cat receives, including natural or artificial light, since cats' estrous cycles are heavily influenced by season light changes. Another alternative may be the use of gonadotropin, a hormone which induces ovulation in animals unable to do so normally. If improper breeding does not seem at fault, your veterinarian will begin treatment for other underlying causes for infertility. For example, antibiotics are given if a uterine infection is suspected. Some of the surgical considerations include surgical repair of the obstructed reproductive tract, surgical correction of abnormalities in the vagina, removal of a cancerous ovary, and either draining or surgically removing the ovarian cysts. Your veterinarian will schedule a follow-up exam to test your cat's progesterone hormone levels, and to perform an ultrasonography exam to confirm a healthy pregnancy and placental position.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_myopathy_focal_inflammatory,Inflamed Chewing Muscles and Eye Muscles in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Myopathy is a general term that is used to denote any disorder of the muscles. Focal inflammatory myopathy is a localized form of the disease that affects specific muscle groups, in this case the masticatory (chewing) muscles and extraocular (eye) muscles. The masticatory muscles are a group of four facial muscles that are used for chewing, and the extraocular muscles are a group of muscles, adjacent to eyeball, that control the movements of the eyes. Focal inflammatory myopathy is suspected to be due to autoantibodies, or antibodies that are known to react against the body's own tissues. Antibodies are proteins found in the blood and which are used by the immune system to identify and destroy foreign invaders, such as bacteria and viruses. In effect, the antibody has crossed signals, mistakenly attacking the body as though reacting to a pathogen. Focal inflammatory myopathy describes a condition in which these autoantibodies begin targeting the muscles of the affected animal. This disease is relatively rare in cats. Masticatory muscles Extraocular muscles Immune-mediated You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history of symptoms. After taking a detailed history, your veterinarian will conduct a complete physical examination on your cat. Your veterinarian may attempt to manipulate your cat's jaw muscles to induce pain and swelling of the muscles so that the source of the problem is more evident. Your veterinarian will also try to open your cat's mouth, which often proves unsuccessful in these patients. Laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The biochemistry profile may indicate higher levels of serum creatine kinase, indicating muscle injury. More specific testing includes taking a muscle tissue sample, especially important in masticatory diseases. This test can help in reaching a confirmatory diagnosis. More advanced testing may include demonstrating the autoantibodies against the muscle fibers. Diagnostic imaging will include X-ray of the jaw bones and ultrasound of the eye orbit to examine the swollen extraocular muscles. Magnetic resonance imaging may also be used to examine the muscle inflammation. As focal inflammatory myopathy is an immune-mediated disease, immune-suppressive drugs will be used to suppress the cat's immune system in order to limit the abnormal immune response. The dose is adjusted and maintained at lower doses to prevent restricted jaw mobility. In most patients long-term treatment will cover a minimum of six months before there is a resolution of symptoms. Abnormal jaw movements remain a major problem because it limits the cat's ability to take food into its mouth. If the disease becomes chronic, the muscle bulk of the jaws and face may reduce considerably, further complicating the jaw's movements. In severe cases, stomach tubes may be required in order to feed your cat a liquid or gruel diet to maintain health. Your veterinarian will brief you about the proper care and use of the stomach tube, including how to clean before and after use. This is essential, as improperly cleaned, contaminated medical aids can cause severe infection. Long-term use of immune-suppressive drugs are harmful for the patient's overall health. It is important to strictly follow the dosage and frequency of the medication in order to avoid complications related to their use. Never modify the dosage of the immune-suppressive drugs or stop the treatment without prior consulting with the veterinarian. If you have any concerns you should consult with your veterinarian first. You will also need to isolate your cat to some degree while it is under treatment to protect it from outside illnesses, and from transmissible illnesses from other animals or pets. Most patients respond well to the immune-suppressive drugs and jaw mobility will return to normal. However, in chronic cases, the prognosis is often not good due to the loss of muscle bulk. Timely treatment is the single most important factor in the treatment of cats with focal inflammatory myopathy. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_panosteitis,Inflammation of Bone in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Panosteitis refers to a painful condition that affects the cat's long leg bones and is characterized by limping and lameness. It can occur with any breed, but it is more common in medium- to large-sized cat breeds and young cats around 5 to 18 months in age. The inflammation can affect one or more of the cat's limbs, making it challenging and painful to move around. With treatment, the inflammation can be reduced and the cat can regain full function and activity. Panosteitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Lameness is often characterized by trouble walking on the front legs, as there is often a deep pain associated with the bones. While the inflammation is more common in the front legs, it is also found in the back legs. Some cats also exhibit fever, depression, weight loss, and anorexia. Additionally, if the condition is not corrected, some cats may experience loss of muscle mass (atrophy) over time with the lack of muscle usage. Overall, the causes of this condition are unknown. While lameness can affect any breed at any age, it is most common in younger breeds. The lameness may occur on its own or it may be accompanied with other orthopedic diseases. Joint pain can last from days to months, and will range from mild to severe. Your veterinarian will examine your cat to rule out underlying conditions other than inflammation of the bones. X-ray imaging and blood analysis will be used to search for any underlying conditions. In most cases, the inflammation will be the cause of the pain and can be reduced with drug treatment. In some cases, anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed and administered to help with the pain and to encourage walking. Steroids can also assist in the reduction of inflammation in the bones. Limited activity will help to reduce your cat’s pain. Allowing your cat time to recover, and time for the joints and bones to heal, however, will not reduce the speed of recovery. It is recommended that you take your cat to be re-checked every two to four weeks for progress, as well as to detect if there are any more serious underlying medical issues that have been causing the problems. It is important to observe your pet and work to reduce their overall pain levels through reduction of activity, pain medication, and environment. The pain may last only a few days, or it could last for several months. In rarer cases, juvenile bone (orthopedic) disease can develop. There are currently no known preventive measures for this medical condition. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_esophagitis,Inflammation of the Esophagus in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Esophagitis is the term applied to inflammation of the esophagus -- the muscular tube that carries food down from the mouth cavity to the stomach. Gastrointestinal reflux, or acid reflux , is the most common cause of esophagitis in cats. Acid reflux is the result of stomach acids passing into the esophageal canal, causing irritation to the tissue lining of the esophagus. Young cats born with congenital esophageal abnormalities are at an increased risk for esophagitis. Older cats that are being treated with anesthesia for surgery, or for other reasons, may also develop this condition. One of the most important complications of esophagitis is aspiration pneumonia , by which a cat that is not able to swallow food properly may end up with food material entering into the lungs. Your veterinarian will examine your cat thoroughly after taking a full history from you. You will need to give your veterinarian as much information as you can about your cat's health, including the onset of symptoms, and any possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. Routine laboratory testing will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and a urinalysis, though these tests usually return as normal in such patients. However, in cases of pneumonia, changes related to the infection may be seen in laboratory results. Radiographic studies, including X-ray or ultrasound imaging, may help in the diagnosis of esophagitis. An advanced type of radiography called barium contrast radiography may reveal changes in the esophagus due to inflammation. In barium contrast radiography, barium sulfate is administered orally to the cat. The particles are suspended in the esophagus, making the esophageal canal easier to visualize on X-ray. Endoscopy is also an option for diagnosis in these patients and is often a more reliable procedure for diagnosis of esophagitis. Endoscopy is an internal diagnostic tool which uses an endoscope, a rigid but flexible tube equipped with a camera and methods for retrieving tissue samples, that can be inserted into a hollow cavity, such as the esophagus. Using this method, your veterinarian can look directly into the esophagus in order to visually inspect it, to take pictures, and to take a sample for biopsy. Endoscopy may also be used to remove a foreign body, if required. If your cat is found to have a case of mild esophagitis it may be treated as an outpatient and will not likely need to be admitted into hospital. However, if your cat is suffering from complications like pneumonia, it will need to be admitted into hospital for intensive care and treatment. Fluids will be required for patients suffering from dehydration , and oxygen will be supplemented until your cat's breathing has improved and it is out of danger. Antibiotics are often required to treat pneumonia in affected patients, but this is not always the case. If gastrointestinal reflux is the cause of the esophagitis, your veterinarian will treat the cause and the symptoms to reduce their amount and frequency, and also to prevent the esophagus from narrowing in response to the stress and trauma. Your veterinarian may recommend withholding water and food for a few days. While your cat is recovering, there are various methods for giving nutrition, including intravenous nutrition. When your cat is able to ingest food again, a soft, palatable and highly nutritious food is recommended. Follow up progress checkups are an important part of after care, and endoscopy examinations are usually performed to verify that the esophagus is healing properly. The prognosis for affected animals is good if the esophagitis is recognized and treated promptly and aggressively. However, if the condition has progressed to the point that the esophagus has formed a stricture (narrowing), the prognosis is usually very poor. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/ears/c_ct_otitis_externa_and_otitis_media,Inflammation of the Middle Ear and External Ear Canal in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Otitis externa is a chronic inflammation of a cat's external ear canal. Otitis media, meanwhile, is an inflammation of the cat's middle ear. Both of these terms are used to describe clinical symptoms and are not diseases in themselves. Otitis externa often results when a change in the normal environment of the ear canal causes the glands lining the canal to enlarge and produce excessive wax. Gradually, the outer skin (epidermis) and the inner skin (dermis) produce excessive fibrous tissue (fibrosis) and the canal becomes narrowed. It is normally a secondary symptom of another underlying disease, such as an infection. Otitis externa causes pain, itching, and redness, and when the condition is chronic, it often results in a ruptured ear drum (tympanum) and otitis media. Otitis media typically occurs as an extension of otitis externa, causing a ruptured membrane (tympanum) that separates the external ear and the middle ear. The two conditions described in this medical article affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how they affect dogs please visit this page in the PetMD health library. The most common symptoms of otitis externa and otitis media are pain, head shaking, scratching at the external ear flaps, and bad odor. In a physical examination by a veterinarian, a cat with the condition may exhibit redness and swelling of the external ear canal, scaling skin or obstruction of the ear canal. Signs such as tilting the head, anorexia, uncoordination, and occasional vomiting may indicate the development of otitis media, or otitis interna, if the infection and inflammation spreads to the inner ear. Otitis externa and otitis media can be caused by a variety of things. The primary causes are parasites, food allergies, drug reactions, foreign bodies (e.g., plant awns), accumulation of hair, dead skin buildup (keratinization), and autoimmune diseases. Other factors that may contribute to the onset of the inflammatory conditions include bacterial infections, mixed infections caused by bacteria and fungal species, and progressive changes in the environment of the outer ear canal. Excessive moisture caused by swimming, or overzealous, abrasive, and improper ear cleaning may also lead to otitis externa and otitis media. These two conditions can be diagnosed in several ways. For instance, X-rays may be used to diagnose otitis media; an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to identify an accumulation of fluid or soft tissue growth in the middle ear. Other ways of diagnosing these conditions include skin scrapings from the cat's ear flaps to test for parasites, and skin biopsies to check for autoimmune diseases. However, the single most important tool for diagnosing otitis externa and otitis media is a microscopic examination of the ear discharge (aural exudate). Treatment for otitis externa and otitis media usually involves outpatient care, unless the inflammation or infection has moved into the inner ear. In most cases of otitis externa, a topical therapy following a complete cleansing of the external ear is an effective resolution to the problem. The topical therapy may consist of antibacterial, corticosteroid, anti-yeast, and antiseptic drops. In severe cases of otitis externa and otitis media -- where the presence of infectious organisms has been confirmed -- oral antibiotics and antifungals may be prescribed. Corticosteroids may also be used to reduce the cat's pain and swelling. Follow-up treatments for otitis externa and otitis media involve repeat examinations of the ear discharge and control of any underlying diseases. You may be asked to routinely cleanse the cat’s ear to prevent a recurrence. With the proper therapy, most cases of otitis externa will resolve within three to four weeks, whereas otitis media takes a considerably longer amount of time to treat it, and up up to six weeks to be resolved. If these conditions persist over long periods of time, and are not treated, they may lead to deafness, facial nerve paralysis, otitis interna, and (rarely) meningoencephalitis.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_phlebitis,Inflammation of the Superficial Veins in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Phlebitis is associated with a condition known as superficial thrombophlebitis -- an inflammation of veins close to the surface of the body, also known as the superficial veins. Phlebitis is generally due to an infection, or because of thrombosis -- the formation of a clot (or thrombus) inside a blood vessel, which in turn obstructs the flow of blood through the body. Superficial venous thrombophlebitis is the most common form of this condition, and is usually localized in one area. Deep tissue thrombophlebitis, conversely, is associated with clinical signs of sepsis, in which a bacterial infection occurs due to the presence of pathogenic organisms and their toxins in the blood or tissues. This type of thrombophlebitis is also associated with deep tissue thromboembolism, in which a clot or thrombus formed in one part of the body breaks free and migrates to another blood vessel, where it causes blockage. Phlebitis can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. The main symptom of phlebitis is a localized inflammation, which can be seen due to warmth, swelling, pain, hardened vessels, or a redness of the skin known as erythema. If at least two of the aforementioned signs are present, this can be taken as a sign of local inflammation. Drainage or fever may also be present, both being associated with such infections. There is no age, breed, or gender of cat that is known to be more susceptible to the development of phlebitis. However, very young or elderly cats may be at higher risk simply due to a less developed or poorly functioning immune system. Characteristics that are considered risk factors for the development of phlebitis include obesity, lack of mobility, poor vein quality, chronic heart or kidney disease, pregnancy, and/or an immunodeficiency disorder in which the cat's immune system does not function properly. The main cause of phlebitis is intravenous (IV) catheter use. Poor catheter quality or care may lead to bacterial colonization of a catheter, which can then infect the cat. Catheters are often used during surgery, or for the treatment of trauma victims. A number of diagnostic procedures are necessary for properly diagnosing phlebitis. The Doppler test is an inexpensive means for testing blood flow in the cat's veins, and may reveal any blood circulation irregularities and blockage. Blood cultures may also indicate signs associated with systematic inflammations. Additional diagnostic techniques may include X-ray imaging and urine analysis. If infection is suspected, antibiotic treatment will be the most likely treatment. The specific antibiotic prescribed for your cat will depend on the location of the infection, as well as the suspected contaminants behind the infection (if no culture is available at the time). Additional medications may help to make your cat more comfortable by alleviating related symptoms. After the initial treatment, antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on the follow-up culture tests. Certain veins, known as phlebotic veins, should be avoided for IV therapy or blood collection until your cat has completely healed. With proper antibiotic treatment, the most severe cases may still take up to three weeks to resolve. Because the main cause of phlebitis is poor quality catheters or improper catheter care, this is the primary area to target when thinking about prevention. Any IV catheter sites should be cleaned regularly with antimicrobials and treated with antimicrobial ointment, in order to avoid bacterial infection that may lead to phlebitis. Sterile dressings should be used, and catheters should be changed within 24 hours, especially if they were placed in an emergency situation. Longer catheters may reduce the incidence of phlebitis.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_inflammatory_bowel_disease,Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in Cats,"AnnaStills/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in cats is a group of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases that have no singular cause. IBD in cats causes inflammation of the stomach, small intestines, and/or large intestines. This can be a frustrating disease to diagnose and treat, but cats can have a great quality of life and live a long time with the appropriate treatment from their veterinarian. Let’s look at everything you need to know about inflammatory bowel disease in cats, from symptoms and causes to diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms of IBD in cats usually are chronic and occur with increased frequency over time (daily, weekly, or monthly). Here are the most common symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease in cats: Diarrhea Weight loss Fatigue Chronic intermittent vomiting Gas ( flatulence ) Abdominal pain Rumbling and gurgling abdominal sounds Bright red blood in the stool Distressed coat hair Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Though no single cause of IBD in cats is known, more than one cause is typically suspected. These include: Hypersensitivity to bacteria Food allergies that may include meat proteins, food additives, artificial coloring, preservatives, milk proteins, and gluten (wheat) Genetic factors: purebred cats have a higher risk of IBD, with Siamese being more commonly affected. Chronic stress and/or anxiety To diagnose IBD in cats, a veterinarian will take a detailed history and ask a pet parent questions about the duration and frequency of symptoms. A complete physical examination will then be conducted, followed by routine laboratory tests, including: Blood work , including a complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile Urinalysis Fecal analysis Although these tests do not definitively diagnose IBD in cats, they are noninvasive and help rule out other diseases (such as kidney disease , elevated thyroid levels , and liver disease ) where the symptoms can be identical to IBD. The results of these routine laboratory tests are often normal. In some patients, anemia and an abnormally high number of white blood cells (infections) may be present. With inflammatory bowel disease in cats, abnormal levels of proteins and liver enzymes may also be found. Your veterinarian may also conduct tests to check the functioning of your cat’s small intestine. An abdominal ultrasound is likely to be recommended to rule out other diseases not found in blood work (such as pancreatitis or cancer ). It can also help vets assess the stomach and intestinal wall thickness, which can be significantly thicker in cats with IBD. Some cats that have inflammation of their GI tract will also experience concurrent inflammation of both the pancreas (pancreatitis), liver and gall bladder (cholangiohepatitis). When cats have all three of these conditions (IBD, pancreatitis, cholangiohepatitis) it is referred to as feline triaditis. Your veterinarian may recommend biopsies of your cat’s stomach and intestines. This can be done with surgery or with endoscopy. Biopsies are the only way to definitively diagnose IBD and determine the extent of the disease. Once a diagnosis is made, a tailored treatment plan will be created for your pet. IBD in cats cannot be “cured” but can be successfully managed. However, even after complete recovery, relapses of inflammatory bowel disease in cats are common. Major goals of treatment are: Stabilizing your cat’s weight Relieving GI symptoms Reducing the immune system's response Diet trials, immunosuppressive medications, and antibiotics are key components of the therapy for inflammatory bowel disease in cats. Dietary management is another essential component of therapy for IBD in cats, with hypoallergenic or novel protein diets being the most recommended by vets. Hills Food Sensitivities z/d food and Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein H/P are examples of commonly prescribed diets for cats with IBD. It usually takes two to four weeks or so to see if your cat responds positively to this diet. It’s not uncommon to try several types of diets—therefore, it could take several months to see if the diet is effective. During the diet trial, only use the veterinary food. Avoid giving your cat treats, tuna , or anything flavored, including medications. Keep a journal of the symptoms prior to and during a diet trial for your veterinarian to see if any difference is noted. Cats that are diagnosed with IBD are often managed on steroids. Steroids help to reduce the inflammation and minimize the symptoms your cat is experiencing. It’s best that steroids be tapered down to the lowest effective dose. Your cat will likely be prescribed a higher dose until the GI signs go away, then gradually tapered lower until you find the smallest dose that keeps the symptoms away, while having to give less medication. Prednisolone and budesonide are the most commonly prescribed steroids used to manage IBD in cats. Cobalamin is given in some cats to counteract B12 deficiency, which is a result of some IBD cases. Cobalamine is Vitamin B12. It’s very helpful for patients diagnosed with IBD. It’s commonly given as a weekly injection under the skin. This is something your vet can teach you how to do, or you can set up regular technician appointments to get this done at the clinic. Routine deworming is always a good idea in any cat affected by chronic diarrhea. As parasites will undergo intermittent shedding, they can often be missed on fecal float exams. Many vets will recommend deworming as part of a cat’s protocol to ensure they’ve covered all the bases. The short-term prognosis for most cases of IBD in cats is excellent. Be patient with the forms of treatment suggested by your veterinarian and strictly adhere to their diet recommendations. In most cases of inflammatory bowel disease in cats, living a long and happy life is likely. The sooner the diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the better chances your cat has to recover. In more severe cases, cats can have a difficult time responding to treatments or could not respond at all—the prognosis is poorer for these cats. The best food for cats diagnosed with IBD is a hydrolyzed protein diet that is extremely gentle on the GI tract. In these veterinary diets, the proteins have been broken into such small pieces that they don’t elicit an allergic/inflammatory reaction. Severe IBD is usually treated with oral steroids, prescription food, and weekly B12 injections. Affected cats will vomit if the lining of their stomach and upper GI tract is inflamed. Those with inflammation of the lower GI tract will experience diarrhea. No, IBD in cats is not contagious.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/inguinal-hernia-cats,Inguinal Hernia in Cats: Causes and How To Treat It,"Kateryna Kukota/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Inguinal hernias in cats occur when there is a defect in the abdominal (stomach) wall that normally separates organs from the groin, or in the area where your cat’s thigh meets their abdomen. This defect may start as a weakened muscle before forming a complete hole. Kittens can be born with inguinal hernias or cats may get them later in life, most commonly due to trauma. Inguinal hernias allow organs, like the intestines, to slide from the abdomen (where they should be) into the groin area of affected cats. They cause an obvious swelling in the groin area that may lead to weight loss , decreased appetites , and discomfort , along with other symptoms. Inguinal hernias can become medical emergencies if an organ becomes trapped in the groin area. It can cut off blood supply and lead to extreme pain. If you suspect your cat has an inguinal hernia, see a veterinarian immediately. Symptoms of inguinal hernias in cats include the following: Swelling in groin area Lethargy Gas Bloating Pain in abdomen or groin Decreased appetite Weight loss Vomiting Diarrhea Difficult or frequent urination Possible causes of inguinal hernias in cats may include: Congenital defect: Some kittens are born with a defect in their abdominal wall. Without proper closure, a hole remains open from the abdomen to the groin. Trauma: Any blunt force trauma, such as being hit by a car , can result in a tear in the abdominal wall, which could allow organs, such as the intestines or urinary bladder, to pass through into the groin area. Straining: If a cat is experiencing constipation , straining can bother the abdominal muscles and may lead to an inguinal hernia. Pregnancy: Pregnant cats experience weakening of the abdominal muscles, which can lead to inguinal hernias as the belly puts pressure on the groin area. Senior cats are at an increased risk of inguinal hernias as their muscles weaken with age. Pregnant females are also more likely to experience this condition due to the increased weight of the abdomen, coupled with weakened abdominal muscles. Veterinarians diagnose inguinal hernias in cats with a physical exam . Generally, there will be an obvious swelling in the groin area. However, depending on the size of the hernia, the organ that causes the swelling can move freely within the opening, so swelling may not always be present. A veterinarian can feel this area for a noticeable defect in the muscle, even in the absence of swelling. Pet parents should let their veterinarian know when they first noticed the swelling, if their cat is showing any pain, and any other concerning symptoms (like decreased appetite) they may have seen. If a hernia is suspected, a veterinarian may perform diagnostic testing to confirm it or to determine its size. These may include: X-rays: X-rays visualize the inside of the body, which can indicate an inguinal hernia and which organ may be affected. Ultrasound: Sound waves are used to identify the inside of the cat’s body to visualize the area between the abdomen and the groin. Exploratory surgery: If X-rays and ultrasound are inconclusive, surgery may be needed to identify whether an inguinal hernia is present. Treatment for inguinal hernias in cats usually involves surgery. A veterinarian will identify the defect in the abdominal wall, replace the organ in its proper location in the abdomen (and remove any damaged portions), and sew the hole closed. Following surgery, a veterinarian may prescribe pain medications , such as Onsior or buprenorphine , to keep the cat comfortable. There is a chance that inguinal hernias may reappear after recovery; however, this is rare. Recovery time varies, but most cats bounce back quickly within seven to 10 days following surgery. Some cats may require an recovery cone during this time to prevent them from licking their incision site, which can lead to it opening up or becoming infected. It’s also important for pet parents to keep their cats calm and prevent them from jumping or playing roughly while their incisions heal. Many inguinal hernias are not preventable, since they can be present at birth. Pet parents should ensure their cat receives regular wellness care to identify abnormalities early, so they can be promptly fixed. Since inguinal hernias can develop after trauma, ensuring your cat remains indoors away from potential hazards can also be helpful. Spaying your cat can also reduce her risk of developing inguinal hernias, because pregnant animals are at an increased risk for this condition. Cats can live for a long time with small inguinal hernias; however, due to the risk of entrapment of organs in the hernia, this condition should be promptly treated by a veterinarian. The main warning sign of an inguinal hernia is swelling near the groin area. Other signs may include unexplained weight loss, lethargy, pain or discomfort, and gas. Costs vary depending on the location of the veterinarian, but generally, surgery for this condition may range in cost from $300 to $600.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_feline_idiopathic_seborrhea,Inherited Skin Disease in the Persian Cat,"PetMD Editorial Persian cats are known to inherit a disorder called idiopathic seborrhea. This primary skin disease leads to overproduction of an oily, waxy substance by the skin glands, which clumps in the fur and causes a bad smell. Though often seen in Persians, seborrhea can affect various breeds of cat and typically in the same way -- the skin becomes red and irritated, which leads to scratching and further cellular damage. There are two common forms of seborrhea: seborrhea sicca, in which the skin becomes more dry and flaky; and seborrhea oleosa, in which the skin becomes more oily. Most animals with inherited seborrhea have a combination of the two forms. Seborrhea in cats tends to affect the skin along the back and around the eyes and ears. It also causes irritation in those areas where the skin folds, such as in the armpits; on the underside; around legs; and on the face, feet, and neck. In the primary (also called idiopathic, or unknown) form of the inherited disease, the cause of seborrhea is unknown. In the case of a secondary seborrhea, the cause may be due to an underlying problem, which can include: Your veterinarian will do a physical examination and check your cat for any disease that may cause a secondary seborrhea. Tests that may be used include: Once every other potential cause of the condition is ruled out, a diagnosis of primary idiopathic seborrhea can be made. If your cat is a Persian, the vet will have an even easier time making the diagnosis, as they are prone to idiopathic seborrhea. As it is not possible to cure idiopathic seborrhea, treatment will mainly focus on controlling the condition. This may include using a combination of shampoos and conditioners to control the amount of oily buildup and calm the itchy skin. Your veterinarian may also prescribe oral vitamin or fatty acid supplements. If your cat contracts a secondary infection, other therapies such as antibiotics (oral and topical), antifungals, and sometimes allergy medications may be necessary. Keep your pet clean and well hydrated. This will help control the condition and reduce the chances that a secondary infections develop. In addition, schedule regular follow-up exams with your veterinarian to monitor the cat's skin condition. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_%20organophosphate_carbamate_toxicity,Insecticide Toxicity in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Areas that are geographically prone to heavy flea and tick infestations tend to use many different forms of insecticide (e.g., organophosphates and carbamates). But exposure to insecticides -- especially after heavy or repeated applications of the chemicals -- may be toxic to cats. These forms of insecticide poisoning affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how it affects dogs please this page in the PetMD health library. Cats exposed to toxic chemicals may not exhibit all of the signs of poisoning. In fact, sometimes insecticides will cause the opposite of these symptoms instead, but there will usually be some indication that the cat is not well. If you suspect that your pet is unwell because of exposure to insecticides, you will need to remove your cat from the toxic environment, or cease using the insecticides, and seek medical attention for it before the condition becomes dire. The following are some of the symptoms of toxic poisoning: Toxic levels of carbamate insecticides like methomyl and carbofuran can cause seizures and respiratory arrest in your cat. Organophosphate toxicity, meanwhile, may lead to chronic anorexia, muscle weakness and muscle twitching which may last for days or even weeks. Someorganophosphate insecticides commonly used include coumaphos, cyothioate, diazinon, fampfhur, fention, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos. This same kind of poisoning can occur with agricultural, lawn and garden insecticide products. Organophosphate types of these products are acephate, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, disulfoton, fonofos, malathion, parathion and terbufos. Carbamate types of these products are carbofuran and methomyl. This same kind of poisoning can occur with agricultural, lawn and garden insecticide products. Organophosphate types of these products are acephate, chlorpyrifos (which is especially toxic to cats), diazinon, disulfoton, fonofos, malathion, parathion and terbufos. Carbamate types of these products are carbofuran and methomyl. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides inhibit cholinesterases and acetylcholinesterase, essential enzymes in the body. Cholinesterases are enzymes which break down acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter. Consequently, acetylcholine remains attached to the postsynaptic receptors of the neurons causing continuous, unending nervous transmission to nervous tissue, organs and muscles (smooth and skeletal). This causes seizures and shaking. Toxicity can occur due to the overuse, misuse, or use of multiple cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides; overexposure to insecticides in the surrounding home environment; the misuse of organophosphate insecticides in cats (e.g., organophosphate-containing dips labeled for dogs only, inappropriately applied to cats); or the intentional application of house or yard insecticides on cats. If your cat has been diagnosed as having toxic levels of insecticide in its system, your veterinarian will immediately stabilize and decontaminate your pet. Your veterinarian will also administer an antidotal treatment to your cat. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. If you know what type of toxin your pet was exposed to, or you have a sample of it, you should take a sample with you so that your doctor can better treat the poisoning. Your veterinarian will then send a sample of whole blood to a laboratory experienced in handling animal samples. A positive result is confirmed when cholinesterase in the blood is less than 25 percent of normal levels. Depending on how long it has been since your cat ingested the toxin (if exposure was via ingestion), you veterinarian may induce vomiting for your pet. Your doctor may also wash out it’s stomach with a tube (lavage), and then give it activated charcoal to detoxify and neutralize any remaining insecticide. Antidotal treatments specific to the toxin will also be given to your pet. Further treatment may include an oxygen cage if your pet is having trouble breathing, and fluid therapy if your pet has been unable to drink or is anorexic. Cats suffering from seizures will be given anti-seizure medication to stop the seizures. If exposure to the toxin came through the skin, your veterinarian will use specialized wash for removing the residue from the hair and skin of your pet. The sooner your cat is treated after being exposed to organophosphate or carbamate insecticides, the better the prognosis is. Organophosphate toxicity in cats may last two to four weeks, but most patients will fully recover with the aid of aggressive care. Avoid using insecticides -- flea or tick treatments -- on sick or debilitated cats, as it will affect the body more easily because of the weakened immune system. If your cat needs to be treated for pests while it is recovering, or if it is sick for any other reason, ask your veterinarian to recommend some alternatives to chemical treatments. Organophosphates and carbamates both inhibit cholinesterases enzymes; giving both at the same time is likely a toxic dose of insecticide. And as always, read the instructions on the insecticide labels before using them. Image: Komar via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

Organophosphate toxicity in cats may last two to four weeks, but most patients will fully recover with the aid of aggressive care. Avoid using insecticides -- flea or tick treatments -- on sick or debilitated cats, as it will affect the body more easily because of the weakened immune system. If your cat needs to be treated for pests while it is recovering, or if it is sick for any other reason, ask your veterinarian to recommend some alternatives to chemical treatments. Organophosphates and carbamates both inhibit cholinesterases enzymes; giving both at the same time is likely a toxic dose of insecticide. And as always, read the instructions on the insecticide labels before using them. Image: Komar via Shutterstock Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_oliguria_anuria,Insufficient Urine Production in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Oliguria is the medically defined term for a condition in which an abnormally small amount of urine is produced by the body - with urine production at a rate of less than 0.25 milliliters per kilogram per hour. Anuria is the medical term used to describe a condition in which essentially no urine is produced by the body, with urine production at a rate of less than 0.08 milliliters per kilogram per hour. Physiologic oliguria occurs when the kidneys limit loss of renal water in order to preserve body fluid and electrolyte balance. Pathologic oliguria results from severe impairment of kidney tissues, which can occur as the result of a number of factors. Anuria may result from kidney disease, or obstruction of urinary flow. Generally, a key symptom of oliguria or anuria is a decreased amount of urine being produced and excreted. Additional symptoms vary depending on the type of oliguria or anuria present. Signs of physiologic oliguria include dehydration, pale mucous membranes, a weak pulse, a rapid or irregular pulse, and a history of fluid loss (through excessive vomiting or diarrhea, for example). Signs of pathologic oliguria typically include a history of progressive kidney disease with symptoms such as poor appetite and weight loss. Signs of anuria may be observed during a physical examination, with revealing symptoms such as fluid infiltration into the tissues surrounding the urinary tract, and pain in the abdomen on palpation. Various conditions may be responsible for different types of oliguria and anuria. Physiologic oliguria may be occasioned by renal hypoperfusion, which is caused by low blood volume or blood pressure, or hypertonicity, an increased pressure of fluids in the body. Pathologic oliguria is usually due to acute (sudden) kidney failure, or chronic kidney disease. Anuria may result from a complete obstruction in the urinary tract, a rupture in the urinary excretory pathway, or from very severe kidney failure. A number of risk factors may increase the odds of developing oliguria or anuria, including dehydration, low blood pressure, kidney disease, liver disease, trauma, such as from a car accident, sugar diabetes, and multiple organ failure. Key diagnostic procedures include an urethrocystoscopy, which uses an insertable diagnostic tool to view the interior of the urinary tract and bladder wall, and which may provide evidence for obstruction or rupture of the urinary tract. Additional tests may include urine analysis, an electrocardiograph (ECG), abdominal radiographs and ultrasounds to rule out or confirm a urinary obstruction. Oliguria and anuria are medical emergencies that require immediate treatment. If left untreated, these conditions can lead to death within hours or days. Proper treatment is dependent upon the cause of the condition. Renal hypoperfusion, if present, needs to be corrected by intravenous (IV) administration of a normal saline solution or similar fluid. Once the renal hypoperfusion is corrected, a diuretic medication to encourage urine production and flow may be prescribed. Is there is an obstruction in the urinary tract, such as abnormal tissue growth in the form of a neoplasm (tumor), this will need to be removed. In cases of primary oliguria and anuria, treatment is limited to addressing the symptoms and supporting the patient long enough for spontaneous recovery of kidney function to occur. Elimination of causative factors may stop or slow further kidney damage. It is essential that your cat's urinary flow rate be monitored so that signs of progress can be tracked. A urinary catheter may be necessary to accurately determine urine volume, but it is important to place and clean catheters properly to avoid the development of a bacterial urinary tract infection. Your veterinarian will advise you on the best way to go forward with this procedure. Due to the fact that there are such a wide variety of causes for oliguria and anuria, there is no one specific prevention method that can be suggested. A generally healthy lifestyle may be helpful.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/behavioral/c_ct_aggression_intercat,Inter-cat Aggression,"PetMD Editorial Bringing a new cat into a home where there is already a cat, or cats, can cause some problems -- both passive and active aggression. Females will usually live peaceably with each other. However, if aggression and conflict rear their ugly heads in a household of formerly nonviolent female cats, it’s probably because one has reached the status of social maturity, which occurs at around four years of age. In addition, non-neutered males will aggressively compete for mates. When the cat is introduced to your other pets, the most typical behavior is active aggression -- the resident cat goes after the intruder, biting, hissing, and scratching. Some cats are very confident and will not back down, regardless of the size of the other cat. Also, very confident cats will often use passive aggression. In this case, a stare and a lowering of the head are all that are required to bring the other cat into submission. Overt Aggression Overt aggression is any hostile behavior that is obvious. The most clear sign of aggression is attacking and fighting, but before that there are other signs that can be observed; clear indications that there is going to be trouble. If you become aware of this behavior, you can be sure that without intervention, there is going to be a fight. Behavior typical of the aggressor includes staring the other cat down, hissing and swiping at the other cat, raising its back and hackles (the erectile hairs on the back are raised), and thrashing its tail back and forth. Involuntary physical reactions to aggression will also show. The ears will be flattened back against the head, and the eyes will be dilated. The aggressor will mark areas of the home to establish its dominance, either by using the scent glands under its chin, or by urinating . Covert Aggression Covert aggression is less apparent. The aggressor will use different methods to keep its rival away from resources like food and water, the litter box, and sleeping areas. Human attention will also be an opportunity for the aggressor cat to show its dominance, as it will block the other cat from receiving attention or even getting near to people. Favored areas of the victim cat may be marked by the aggressor, causing the victim to avoid those areas. The victim will urinate and defecate in other places in the house if it is kept away from the litter box. Inter-cat aggression can be caused by a decrease in individual space, usually due to overcrowding, or because a new cat has been brought into the household. It can also be due an illness or a disruption in the household, such as moving or hospitalization of one of the cats. Your veterinarian will want to rule out a physical cause for your cat’s behavior before making recommendations for solving the problem. If it is determined to be a physical cause, appropriate treatment will be prescribed. For instance, blood tests may reveal hyperthyroidism. Other physical conditions that can cause your cat to behave unusually are brain lesions, and urinary tract disorders . If there is no evidence showing that the behavior is rooted in a physical problem, your doctor will consider behavioral conditions. This can range from incomplete socialization with other cats; fear aggression, or not having the psychological resources to deal with situations it is not accustomed to; and territorial aggression, where the cat has decided that it is going to settle a piece of turf as its own and will defend it. If the behavior is not due to any physical ailments, anti-anxiety medication or behavioral modification may be recommended. Now it is up to you. Begin by putting the aggressor in a less-desirable room behind a locked door with food, water, and a litter box. The victim cat, on the other hand, should be allowed to roam freely and have access to the more favorable areas. If there are more than two cats, group them by personality, but keep the ""bullies"" alone. The aggressors should only be allowed out when they can be supervised. At the first sign of aggression, it needs to return to the less-desirable room. You may want to try leashes and harnesses to gain control of the animals. In addition, put a bell on the aggressor so the other cats always know where it is. Use rewards to condition cats to each other, such as treats, massage, and grooming. Do not use physical punishment...ever. It will only make things worse. In most cases, behavior-modification methods work, however, it may some time to see a difference in the cat and there may be relapses. Establishing dominance over your pets is important. Your cats may never form close bonds, but they should be able to share a living space. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_gastrointestinal_obstruction,Intestinal Blockage in Cats,"An intestinal blockage (obstruction) is a common emergency condition that occurs when there is a partial or complete blockage of the intestines that prevents solids or liquids from passing through. Gastrointestinal obstruction and intestinal blockage are medical terms that are often used interchangeably for the same condition. However, while a gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction could include an intestinal blockage, the reverse is not true, as an intestinal blockage applies only to the intestines and GI applies to the entire digestive tract (the stomach and small and large intestines). Normally, the GI tract undergoes a process called peristalsis, where food and contents are pushed from the stomach to the small intestines, then to the large intestines, into the colon, and out of the rectum and anus. When an obstruction occurs, nothing can pass through. As a result, contents can be backed up into the stomach and your cat may vomit. GI obstruction is a surgical emergency. Left untreated, it can result in the death of your cat. If you believe your cat has an intestinal or GI blockage, contact your local emergency veterinarian immediately. Cats diagnosed with a GI obstruction are most often brought to the vet for vomiting and lack of appetite . Other symptoms may include: Abdominal pain Diarrhea Failure to pass stool Straining to defecate Lethargy Changes in behavior (increase in hiding) Weight loss It’s important to mention to your veterinarian if your cat has a habit of playing with string or getting into the garbage—or if you’ve witnessed your cat chewing and/or swallowing something inappropriate. As cats tend to ingest string and similar items while playing with them, these objects have been known to become lodged under the tongue. If you or your veterinarian notice something under the tongue, or if you notice material protruding from your cat’s rectum, do not pull on it! It is often tethered elsewhere and can cause more harm if you attempt to remove it. GI obstruction can result from a variety of causes, and an obstruction can be partial, linear, or complete: A partial obstruction of the GI tract is usually seen with small foreign objects, such as small toys or pieces of cloth, making their way through the intestines. Signs are generally less noticeable, and medical management, including hospitalization for IV fluids to help the item pass, may be an option in these cases. In a linear obstruction , a linear foreign body is ingested, something string-like. But instead of passing through the intestines, one end of the object/string becomes stuck. This often happens when one end becomes lodged under the tongue. When one end becomes stuck, the intestines still try to move around the free end. This movement (peristalsis) causes a bunching effect (plication) of the intestines around the string. The longer the string is present, the greater the chance that the string can cut through the intestines, causing tears (perforations) that result in intestinal contents spilling into the abdominal cavity. This can lead to life-threatening inflammation and an infection called peritonitis . Complete obstructions can occur when large objects or multiple small objects have been swallowed and there is a complete lack of passage of stomach or intestinal contents down the tract. Symptoms usually present quickly and severely. Whether partial, linear, or complete obstruction is noted, the underlying cause may be due to the following: Ingestion of foreign objects, most commonly string, yarn, dental floss, hair ties, or rubber bands Intussusception (an uncommon telescoping of one intestine into itself), which can occur secondary to parasites, infection (such as FIP ), tumors, or foreign-body ingestion Certain types of GI cancer Pyloric stenosis , usually seen as a congenital condition where the pylorus (the part of the stomach that connects to the small intestine) is narrowed, limiting the passage of food Intestinal entrapment or hernias Partial, linear, or complete blockages can prevent the absorption of nutrients and water from the intestines, resulting in dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Even more dangerous if not treated quickly, the foreign body creating the blockage can put pressure on the intestinal wall (or even cut through the wall as noted above with linear foreign bodies), causing tissue death (necrosis) and bowel rupture with life-threatening consequences. Your veterinarian will start with a physical examination to palpate the abdomen for pain or evidence of masses/foreign bodies/intussusception. In young or thin cats, the vet may be able to palpate the actual obstruction itself. But often the cat is too large or the obstruction too small to palpate it directly in an exam. If no blockage is detected on physical examination but the vet is still concerned there may be one, they will likely perform an abdominal x-ray. If the blockage is a foreign object, particularly if it contains metal, it may be visible on an x-ray. However, if the obstruction is from a string, yarn, or one of the other causes such as a tumor, it may not be directly visible. An “obstructive” gas pattern may be seen where the intestines next to the obstruction are dilated with air or fluid that cannot get through. Linear foreign bodies may show plicated or bunched intestines. If the x-ray is inconclusive or your vet is looking for additional information prior to recommending surgery, they may perform an abdominal ultrasound. The ultrasound is useful at visualizing foreign bodies (including linear foreign bodies) but will also provide more information if a tumor or intussusception is suspected. Bloodwork will likely also be recommended to rule out other causes of the symptoms and to assess hydration and electrolytes. Based on the type and cause of obstruction present, your cat may require one of the following treatments: Induced vomiting: Depending on the foreign body and when your cat ate it, sometimes vomiting can be immediately induced to recover the foreign object and prevent the intestinal blockage from occurring. However, medications used to induce vomiting in cats are not always reliable, and cats can have complications such as aspiration pneumonia associated with inducing vomiting. Endoscopy: If your cat has eaten a foreign object that is still in the stomach and attempts by the vet to force vomiting are unsuccessful, they may suggest endoscopy. This involves using a camera to pass down the throat to visualize and retrieve the foreign object, avoiding obstruction and surgery. If your cat eats a linear object (string, yarn) or other small foreign body (toy, hairband) and it does not become lodged somewhere higher in the gastrointestinal tract (under tongue, in stomach), there is a chance it can pass in their stool. However, if any foreign object (linear or otherwise) becomes stuck and creates an intestinal blockage, surgery will be needed to locate and remove the blockage. Surgery: Most commonly, intestinal blockage will require surgery. The veterinarian will perform exploratory surgery (laparotomy) under general anesthesia to find the cause of the intestinal obstruction. If the obstruction was caused by a foreign body, an incision will be made into the intestines (enterotomy) to remove the object. In the case of linear foreign bodies, sometimes several enterotomies are needed to remove the entire length of the object. Unfortunately, if there was severe damage to the intestines, compromised sections of intestines may need to be removed (resection and anastomosis). If the obstruction was caused by one of the other causes (not a foreign body), the surgeon would relieve the obstruction and determine the best course of action, which may include repairing a hernia or removing a tumor. Surgery is not without risks, but for many cases, it poses the best chance at a successful outcome. Be sure to discuss what the risks could be with your veterinarian. Supportive care: Your cat will be given IV fluids (to rehydrate them) and administered medications for nausea and pain. Often, cats in recovery from major abdominal surgery will sometimes not eat even after the obstruction has been successfully removed. In some cases, they will need a temporary feeding tube to help provide nutritional support while they heal. Your veterinarian will discuss the best course of action for your pet. Diagnosing and treating intestinal blockages as soon as possible is key to achieving the best outcome and minimizing complications such as damage to the intestines, intestine rupture, leakage, or peritonitis). If your cat is diagnosed with an intestinal blockage and surgery is needed, it should be performed as soon as possible. If sections of the intestine must be removed, the likelihood of complications increases, but your cat may still have a good prognosis overall. If the underlying cause of the obstruction is due to cancer or anything other than a foreign body obstruction, the prognosis is lower and would depend on the extent and severity of the condition. Most cats will need to remain hospitalized for 1-2 days after surgery on IV fluids with medications for pain and sometimes appetite stimulation. The typical criteria for being discharged is as long as the cat is eating, there is no vomiting, and the cat is fever-free. Once at home, the recovery for most abdominal surgeries includes 10-14 days of rest and restricted activity. The incision site is checked frequently for swelling and for signs of infection such as discharge, odor, redness, and pain. The cat’s overall behavior and willingness to eat and drink must also be monitored. If any problems are noted, reach out to your veterinarian to have your cat reexamined. Adhere to the vet’s directions about diet and medications. Most cats make a complete recovery, but prognosis can vary based on the cause of the intestinal blockage. If your cat had an obstruction due to a foreign body ingestion, you must be vigilant to prevent reoccurrence. Access to trash, hair ties, string, and other objects must be restricted. If a tumor is identified as the cause of the blockage, a sample can be submitted to a lab to help determine the type of tumor and a prognosis. Cats with a partial obstruction often survive longer than those with a complete obstruction, although timing is variable. If your pet has any of the clinical signs associated with intestinal blockage, especially vomiting, lack of appetite, or straining to defecate with no stool produced, it is important that you seek veterinary care immediately. If a cat is diagnosed with an intestinal blockage, surgery is then recommended as soon as possible. Sometimes, yes. If the blockage is secondary to a small foreign body the pet ingested and is only causing partial obstruction, the object can often pass through the gastrointestinal tract in the stool. IV or subcutaneous fluid therapy may be recommended to ease dehydration and help the object pass. Also, x-rays may be used to track the progress of the object as it moves through. However, complete blockage can occur along with trauma to the GI tract while waiting for the object to pass; always discuss options with your veterinarian.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_adenocarcinoma_stomach_small_large_intestine,Intestinal Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Adenocarcioma is a malignant tumor that may occur in the gastrointestinal (GI) system of a cat. It can occur in any part of the GI system, including the stomach, the small and large intestine, and the rectum. This tumor is rare in cats, but when it does occur older cats are the most commonly affected. No particular cat breed is known to be predisposed, though it is more common in males than females. The prognosis for cats with adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract is usually poor. Symptoms are most commonly related to the gastrointestinal system and include: The exact cause is still unknown, this condition is classified as idiopathic. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Blood tests, fecal tests and a biochemistry profile will be performed. The blood tests usually show mild to severe anemia, mainly due to gradual blood loss through the feces. A sample of the feces will also be examined under microscope to look for the presence of hidden blood. Contrast radiography (using a contrast chemical agent) may reveal the presence, location, and size of the neoplasm. Ultrasound is also a valuable tool in the diagnosis of adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. Using ultrasound, your veterinarian may decide to take a fluid sample through a fine needle to examine for the presence of neoplastic cells in sample fluid. An endoscope is also sometimes used for sample collection. If none of the above mentioned procedures are helpful in confirming a diagnosis, your veterinarian may decide to perform surgery, which will ultimately confirm the assumed diagnosis. Surgery is the treatment of choice in adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal system, but a cure is seldom achieved because metastasis is common in affected patients. In cases of adenocarcinoma of the stomach, it is often difficult to remove neoplastic tissue. In cases of neoplasm of the intestines, the affected portion is removed and the normal portions of the intestine are then sutured together. Chemotherapy may be advised but it is usually unsuccessful. Pain killers are advised for lessening the pain associated with this neoplasm. If surgery is performed on your cat, you may need to return to your attending veterinarian every three months after the surgery. At every visit, your veterinarian will perform the physical examination, take X-rays, and perform ultrasound to see if the tumor is re-growing or not. These tumors characteristically grow rapidly, metastasizing to other parts and organs of the body. In case of gastric adenocarcinoma, the survival time is usually two months, whereas in cases of intestinal neoplasm, few affected cats are reported to survive more than one year. However, survival time is variable and can only be predicted by your veterinarian after a complete evaluation of your cat. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/c_ct_cryptosporidiosis,Intestinal Parasite (Cryptosporidium) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cryptosporidium is an intestinal parasite that is commonly ingested through contaminated water, food or feces. The resulting diseased condition, cryptosporidiosis, can typically be treated effectively with medications. This disease is no more likely to affect one breed than another, and is commonly seen in kittens. The most common symptoms of cryptosporidiosis are fever and diarrhea. Cats will also display intolerance for food, or in more serious cases, will suffer from organ disease. Other symptoms include lethargy and intolerance for exercise. Risk factors include the ingestion of contaminated food or water, the ingestion of animal feces, and intestinal infection. When the cryptosporidium parasite is ingested in the oocyst stage, it is transferred into the body of the host cat. It then develops into a sporozoite, the division and development stage, and proceeds to spread and infect the cells throughout the body. Kittens are at heightened risk of complications due to infestation, since their immune systems are less developed. Bloody diarrhea and dehydration can quickly lead to fatality. A fecal sample will be taken to determine what the underlying cause is for the issue. The parasite will be found in the course of the fecal examination. Treatment for cryptosporidiosis is generally on an outpatient basis, with the recommendation to limit food until the diarrhea has subsided, along with an increase in fluids to combat dehydration. Boil your cat's drinking water to assure that it is clean. For healthy cats, their immune system will fight the parasite and the condition will generally run its course without treatment. Young, old, and immune-compromised animals may need medication and guarded care to prevent internal complications. Prescribed medications, if given, must be followed through to completion. Following treatment, monitoring your cat for signs of improvement is recommended. Overall, prognosis is excellent if the immune system is strong. The most preventative measure available for this disease is to make sure that your cat is in a clean environment, and is not eating animal feces or drinking dirty water, as it could be contaminated with the cryptosporidium organism that causes this condition.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_strongloidiasis,Intestinal Parasitic Infection (Strongyloidiasis) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Strongyloidiasis is an uncommon intestinal infection with the parasite Strongyloides tumefaciens , causing grossly visible nodules and diarrhea. (It is also possible for cats to develop an infection with the parasite S. stercoralis , but there has not yet been a reported case in the United States.) S. tumefaciens is relatively host-specific, but there is a potential for transmission to humans. There are several ways your cat may become infected with S. tumefaciens , including skin penetration, ingestion of contaminated feces, and nursing from an infected bitch. There is an increased prevalence of stronglyoidiasis in kennels, especially when there is poor sanitation and high temperatures and humidity. The challenge your veterinarian will face will be distinguishing the cause of the cat's symptoms, which may be due to several other parasites or bacteria or viruses. He or she may culture a sample of your cat's feces, or perform a colonoscopy on the animal to identify the infective agent and check for a firm colon, which is commonly associated with S. tumefaciens . Unless intravenous fluid supplementation is needed to stabilize your dehydrated cat, it will be treated as an outpatient. Preferred anthelmintic medication, which destroy and remove internal parasites, include ivermectin and fenbendazole. Your veterinarian will want to schedule monthly fecal examinations monthly for the first six months after treatment to assure clearance of infection. During this time, your cat will intermittently shed parasitic larvae and require regular deworming sessions. He or she will also recommend a thorough cleaning of your pet's area and/or kennel to eradicate any potential larvae. You should, however, take precaution when handling the cat or items used by the animal, as humans can sometimes become infected with S. tumefaciens. , causing rashes, severe abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_protein_losing_enteropathy,Intestinal Protein Loss in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Nutrients make their way through the body by way of the bloodstream. From the stomach, the food that has been eaten enters into the intestines, where it is divided into what is useful for the body and what is not. The useful, nutritious bits are picked up by the bloodstream as it passes through the intestines, carrying them to the rest of the body, where they are converted into various types of energy. As the bloodstream picks up these nutrients, a small amount of protein leaks from the blood vessels back into the intestines. Usually these proteins are digested in the intestines, absorbed back into the blood, and used by the body to make more protein, but when the intestines are damaged, more protein leaks out into the intestines than the body can replace. This condition is referred to as protein losing enteropathy (enteropathy being any abnormal condition relating to the intestines). There are a number of diseases that can damage the intestines enough to cause this extra protein loss. Protein losing enteropathies can occur in any cat breed and at any age. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. A thorough physical examination will be performed, and will include standard laboratory work – a complete blood count, biochemical profile and urinalysis. Your veterinarian will use these samples to determine your cat's blood protein level and blood calcium level. There are several causes that will need to be ruled out in order to make a diagnosis. Your veterinarian will order stool (fecal) tests to check for intestinal parasites, intestinal infections, and other indicators that your cat is losing protein from its intestines. Your veterinarian may also check the blood vitamin levels, which will be low if your cat is losing protein from its intestines. X-ray and ultrasound images of your cat's chest and abdomen will allow your veterinarian to visually examine these internal structures for evidence of internal ulcerations or tumors, and will also display the heart's capabilities, and whether its performing abnormally. If your veterinarian needs a better visual of the stomach and intestines than external devices can provide, an endoscopy may be performed for a better view. In this test, a small camera, attached to a tube, is passed through the mouth or anus into the intestines so that the walls of the stomach and intestinal tract can be closely inspected for ulcers, tissue masses (tumors), or abnormalities in the wall or cell structure. The endoscopic device also allows for taking samples of tissue while it is inserted, and is a much less invasive method for performing a biopsy. Bioptic analysis is an especially useful diagnostic tool for determining why an animal is losing protein through its intestines. Treatment will depend on the underlying disease that is causing your cat to lose protein through its intestines. If your cat's protein level is dangerously low, it may need a transfusion to replace some of the blood protein. In most cases there is no cure for protein loss through the intestines. Your veterinarian will work with you to develop a treatment plan to help you manage your cat's symptoms, including a diet that will ensure that the best possible amount of nutrients are being absorbed by your cat's body. During follow-up visits, complete blood counts and biochemical profiles will be done to make sure that your cat's blood protein level is stable and not becoming dangerously low. Your veterinarian will also check your cat to make sure it is not having trouble with breathing and does not have fluid built up in its belly. Encourage your cat to relax by giving it a quiet space in which to withdraw when the house is active, away from children and other pets. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_leiomyoma,Intestinal Tumor (Leiomyoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A leiomyoma of the stomach and intestinal tract is an unusual, but harmless and non-spreading tumor arising from the smooth muscle of the stomach and intestinal tract. The main concern is that this type of tumor can block the normal progress of fluids and solids through the digestive tract, or displace organs, resulting in secondary health complications. It typically occurs in middle-aged to older cats, generally over six years of age. Otherwise, there is no gender or breed predisposition. Stomach Small intestine Large intestine and rectum Unknown Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. He or she will first be looking for evidence of a foreign body in the digestive tract, or an inflammatory bowel disease , parasitic infection, or pancreatitis . Once a tumor has been confirmed, your veterinarian will need to differentiate it from a cancerous gland tumor. There are different types of cancerous tumors that can affect the digestive tract, including leiomyosarcoma, a cancer that grows from the smooth muscle of the digestive tract; and lymphoma, a solid neoplasm that originates in the lymphocytes -- a type of white blood cell in the bloodstream. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Your doctor may need to order an abdominal ultrasound, which may reveal a thickened wall of the stomach or bowel. Gastric leiomyoma is most common at the esophageal–gastric junction, where the esophagus meets the stomach cavity. If necessary, a special imaging technique called a contrast study may be used. This study will involve giving the cat an oral dose of liquid material (barium) that shows up on X-rays. Films are then taken at various stages to examine the passage of the barium through the body. This technique may reveal a space-occupying mass in the digestive tract. Double-contrast radiography of the large intestine and rectum may also be used to reveal a space-occupying mass in these organs. Your veterinarian may also perform an upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, by which a flexible tube with an attached camera is inserted into the space to be examined, in this case the gastrointestinal tract, allowing the doctor to visually inspect the space for abnormalities. These devices also have attachments for gathering samples of tissue and fluid, so that a biopsy can be performed to confirm the preemptive diagnosis. If a tumor is suspected, your doctor will need to perform a mucosal biopsy, and if possible, will take a tissue sample of the mass in the gastrointestinal tract. This method is often not useful for the diagnosis of deep tumors. In these cases, a more invasive surgical biopsy is often required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical resection (removal) is the treatment of choice. This method is generally curative if the tumor can be removed safely. In many cases, owing to their benign nature, even large leiomyomas with narrow margins can be removed successfully. If your doctor is able to perform a complete resection, normal postoperative care will be required; no additional follow-up will be necessary. However, your doctor will want to monitor your cat's blood glucose postoperatively, particularly if your cat was hypoglycemic (low in blood sugar) prior to surgery.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_adenoma,Intestinal Tumors (Apudomas) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Apudoma is a gastrointestinal tumor which secretes peptide hormones -- hormones that play a role in regulating metabolism, growth, development, and tissue function. In the long run, the tumor(s) can cause ulcers, damage the esophagus because of chronic reflux, and damage the lining of the intestines. The cause of apudoma is currently not known. Your veterinarian will want to rule out the following diseases: Your veterinarian will then run blood tests and chemistry analysis to identify if your cat has iron-deficiency anemia as a result of the gastrointestinal bleeding. Other concerns may include inadequate protein in the blood stream and an electrolyte imbalance due to excessive vomiting. In addition, an ultrasound of the abdomen can be used to determine whether there is a tumor in your cat's pancreas, and an aspirate can be used to determine if there are an any masses present to test for mast cell disease. An endoscopy and biopsy of the upper digestive tract may also be recommended. Unfortunately, most apudoma tumors are cancerous (malignant) and by the time they’re discovered, it’s too late to treat them. However, aggressive medical management can sometimes relieve the symptoms and give your cat additional months (or even years) to live. Exploring a pancreatic mass surgically is important for diagnosis, but also for establishing a treatment regimen. Your cat will need frequent physical examinations, as well as careful observation at home. Your veterinarian may also want to conduct X-rays and ultrasound exams from time to time to measure the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. As there is no cure for the disease, the best you can hope for is to keep your pet comfortable and pain free for a few months or years. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_rotavirus_infections,Intestinal Viral Infection (Rotavirus) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The rotavirus is a double-stranded, wheel-shaped RNA virus which causes inflammation of the intestines and in severe cases, dysfunction in the intestinal walls. This virus is the leading cause of diarrhea and gastrointestinal upset in cats. And although it can be seen in cats at any age, kittens are more prone to rotavirus infections. Dogs are also susceptible to rotavirus infections. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. The primary symptom of a rotavirus infection is mild to moderate watery diarrhea. In severe cases, cats may die from dehydration, extreme weight loss, and/or an unwillingness to eat. The rotavirus is typically transmitted through contact with contaminated fecal matter. Cats with underdeveloped or weak immune systems and those living in overly stressed environments are most at risk for the infection. Your veterinarian will try to rule out the following causes for intestinal inflammation before diagnosing rotavirus: feline parvovirus, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline coronavirus, feline astrovirus, and feline calicivirus. Other causes for inflammation of the intestine may include fungal infections, parasites, allergies, or exposure to toxins. Lab tests to detect the virus may include laboratory examination of tissue samples, or microscopic exploration of feces. One such test is ELISA (or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), a biochemical technique. Your veterinarian may also be able to identify the virus using a technique called virus isolation. To formally diagnose rotavirus, a veterinarian will examine the intestinal villi (the small hairs lining the intestine) and other cells within the intestinal wall, using special instruments to detect the rotavirus and antibodies the virus may have produced. Once the rotavirus is formally diagnosed, your veterinarian will begin treatment to ensure a prompt recovery. Treatment involves symptomatic relief to relieve the cat's diarrhea and to help replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Your doctor will also advise temporary dietary restrictions to help alleviate some of your cat's intestinal discomfort. Antibiotics are generally not prescribed because they are only useful for bacterial, not viral infections. Because rotaviruses are zoonotic, it is important that pet owners keep infected cats away from young children, infants in particular. When handling the fecal matter of an infected animal, it is especially important to use precautions, such as wearing latex gloves and disinfecting the animal's living area. Humans living in developing countries are most at risk, often experiencing life-threatening diarrhea. Estimates suggest that in developing countries up to 500,000 children under age five die every year from rotavirus infections. The best protection for a kitten is to consume the milk of an immune cat queen, as they produce antibodies that may protect against the rotavirus.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_astrovirus_infection,Intestinal Virus Due to Bacterial Overgrowth (Astrovirus) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Astrovirus infection is a genus of small, non-enveloped RNA virus that causes intestinal disease symptoms in affected animals. Characteristic symptoms include diarrhea and abdominal pain with watery, green diarrhea. If the diarrhea lasts longer than a week, then it is probably not caused by astrovirus, as the astrovirus generally passes in less than a week. While the astrovirus by itself is not dangerous, dehydration due to lack of fluids and diarrhea can quickly become a dangerous condition. However, fluids can be given on a temporary inpatient basis to help the cat recover. This virus is relatively rare in cats, and shows no tendency for infecting a particular breed, gender, or age. And although the astrovirus infection is communicable amongst cats, it is not communicable between cats and humans. What causes a cat to become infected with the astrovirus is unknown, but it is an infectious virus that is acquired from another cat. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will then perform a thorough physical exam, a blood profile, and a complete blood count. With gastrointestinal diseases, a swab of feces needs to be taken for laboratory analysis. A differential diagnosis, which is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately, will include tests for the presence of parasites (e.g., intestinal worms), toxic ingestion, food allergy, and other viral infections that could be responsible for the symptoms. These include rotavirus , panleukopenia , or enteric coronavirus, all of which can cause the same types of symptoms. The physical exam and complete blood count will indicate to your veterinarian if and to what degree your cat is dehydrated, and how severe the infection is based on how high the white blood cell count is. The blood profile will let your veterinarian know if the diarrhea is caused by a bacteria or a virus. Treatment will depend on the final diagnosis. If your cat is dehydrated due to the diarrhea and lack of fluids, it will receive fluids to rehydrate it immediately. Medication can also be given to control the diarrhea. Your veterinarian may also prescribe a special, bland, easily digestible, high protein veterinary diet tailored for cats with intestinal upset. If astroviral infection is suspected in your cat, then you will need to keep your cat away from all other cats until the infected cat no longer has diarrhea or is displaying any other symptoms.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_reovirus_infections,Intestinal Virus (Reovirus) Infection in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The reovirus is generally found in the cat's intestinal walls, destroying any cells in its surrounding area. Caused by a group of viruses that contain double-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid), a reovirus infection limits the absorption of nutrients from the intestines and results in diarrhea and dehydration. The virus is transmitted through contact with infected feces, or by inhalation of airborne virus particles. These viruses can suppress the immune system, causing the affected animal to develop various infections. The cat's outward conditions, meanwhile, will vary and depend on the type of reovirus. Reovirus infections can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this intestinal virus affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. A cat with a reovirus infection will usually have mild symptoms such as diarrhea and gum inflammation (gingivitis). However, it may succumb to more serious complications, including conjunctivitis, respiratory illnesses, loss of balance, muscle tremors, and ataxia. Your veterinarian will conduct a full physical examination and complete blood profile on the cat, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Diagnostic procedures will be aimed at differentiating a reoviral infection from other milder respiratory infections that are caused by bacteria. Your doctor will also need to include a detailed study of the tissue characteristics, along with the viral structure, in order to confirm a diagnosis. As it is generally not a life threatening condition, reovirus vaccines have not been developed and medications are usually not prescribed. Treatment, instead, will focus on ensuring your cat remains hydrated, that its airways are clear, and that its nervous system is functioning properly. If any of the cat's body systems are disordered, your veterinarian will prescribe medication to treat its specific ailment. Follow your veterinarian's advice and avoid exposing any other healthy pets to your cat. Some reoviruses are contagious, even infect children and infants at times. Therefore, it probably best to isolate your cat until it has recovered. Be aware that some respiratory symptoms may return during your pet's recovery period. If these complications should become serious, bring your cat back to the veterinarian immediately. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_iris_bombe_eye_problem_in_cats,Iris Bombe in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Synechiae are adhesions between the iris and other structures in the eye. They are the result of inflammation in the iris and are particularly common with anterior uveitis (inflammation of the dark tissues of the eye) and trauma to the eye. Iris bombe can occur in both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how this type of eye problem affects dogs, please visit this page in the petMD health library. Synechiae may be anterior or posterior. Symptoms seen with synechiae include: Diagnosis is based on an ophthalmic examination, which involves examining the structures of the eye. In addition, dyes may be used on the cornea to detect corneal injuries. Tonometry may be performed to measure the intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball.) In many cases, no treatment is necessary. If an underlying cause is diagnosed, it should be treated appropriately. In cases where glaucoma is present, laser surgery to repair the synechiae may be attempted. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_iridociliary_cysts_cat_eye_problem,Iris Cysts,"PetMD Editorial Iridociliary cysts are also sometimes known as iris cysts, ciliary body cysts or uveal cysts. In most cases, they are benign and no treatment is necessary. However, occasionally they may be large enough to interfere with vision or with the function of the eye. Iridiociliary cysts may be attached to various parts of the interior of the eye. They may be lightly or darkly pigmented and are semitransparent. They may be spherical to ovoid in shape. They can vary considerably in size and there may be more than one. They may be seen in one or both eyes. In most cases, these cysts are an incidental finding. Only when they are large enough to impair vision or interfere with the normal functioning of the eye are they problematic. Glaucoma can be a complication associated with iridociliary cysts. Cysts may be congenital or acquired. There is a breed predilection in Siamese cats for iridociliary cysts. Iridociliary cysts are diagnosed with an ocular examination. In most cases, no treatment is necessary. If uveitis or glaucoma is present, these diseases will need to be treated appropriately. Laser coagulation can be used to remove particularly large cysts if necessary. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_irritable_bowel_syndrome,Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Cats (IBS),"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in cats is typically an acute (severe and sudden) onset episode of gastrointestinal distress. Episodes of IBS in cats often occur in response to a stressful event, an intolerance or allergy to some component of the cat’s diet, or a change in the normal function of the colon. While IBS in cats is severe and sudden inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) in cats is a syndrome characterized by chronic (long-term) inflammation of the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract. IBD is usually the result of an underlying disease process such as a bacterial imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, or other genetic factors. Definitive diagnosis of IBD requires biopsies of the stomach and intestinal tract via laparotomy (exploratory surgery) or endoscopy (investigation with a long, flexible tube). Cats with IBD typically have thickened intestinal walls due to the chronic inflammatory response. Cats with IBS typically have normal biopsy results. The most common symptoms of IBS in cats include: Diarrhea, which might be accompanied by mucus Dyschezia (painful pooping) Abdominal bloating/gas Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Cats may also experience: Lethargy Loss of appetite Gradual weight loss with persistent stress The episodes of IBS may be frequent, severe, or poorly managed. While a definitive cause of IBS in cats is unclear, IBS typically occurs in response to a stressful event, such as: Travel Boarding Hospitalization Trauma/injury Alteration of the cat’s daily routine or living environment (new home, new baby, new pet) IBS can also come from a dietary intolerance or allergy, or a change in the normal function of the bowel. Your vet will do a physical examination, review your cat’s medical history, and ask about any recent potential stressors when diagnosing your cat with IBS. IBS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, so diagnostic tests, including CBC/blood chemistry, a fecal exam, urinalysis, serologic testing (FeLV/FIV), abdominal X-ray and/or ultrasound, may be ordered to eliminate other conditions. The veterinarian might also recommend intestinal biopsies to rule out other inflammatory, fungal, or neoplastic (abnormal cell growth) conditions. Cats with IBS may show increased spasticity (muscle stiffening) of the colon and more mucus inside the colon if a colonoscopy is performed. However, biopsies of the stomach and intestinal tissues are usually normal in cats with IBS. Stopping the diarrhea and abdominal pain are key treatment goals for cats with IBS. To help your cat, your vet may administer: Intravenous fluids to restore hydration Antidiarrheal medications Stool softener to resolve constipation Antispasmodics to control colon spasms In severe cases of IBS, some cats may benefit from a short course of corticosteroids (prednisolone), antibiotics, and pre/probiotics to help relieve their symptoms. Dietary management, stress management, and medical intervention are important long-term components for your cat’s recovery from IBS. Cats with IBS should be offered an easy-to-digest, high-fiber, low-fat diet to restore normal gut health and promote the return of normal, healthy stools, such as: You can supplement your cat’s diet with probiotics to maintain a healthy bacterial flora in the gut. Cats with a suspected dietary intolerance may also benefit from a diet elimination trial, which means placing your cat on a diet of a new protein they have never tried before. Specific protein intolerances may be identified with an elimination diet, although you will need to monitor your cat for several weeks to see improvement in your cat’s overall physical condition and gastrointestinal health. Stress management is also critical for your cat to avoid recurrent bouts of IBS. Medications that help with anxiety, along with calming collars, sprays or diffusers, and probiotic supplements added to the diet before or after the stressful event may lessen the severity and duration of your cat’s stress. Lifestyle management should focus on eliminating or minimizing stressors in your cat’s daily routine. Support your cat before stressful events, such as travel, boarding, or visits from family and friends, to help minimize your cat’s stress response. Also make sure that your cat with IBS has a nutritionally appropriate life-stage diet, regular human interaction, and daily exercise. These lifestyle elements are vital to promoting your cat’s mental health and well-being. Cats with IBS often respond and improve after transitioning to a hypoallergenic diet with a new protein if a dietary intolerance is suspected. Easy-to-digest, high-fiber, low-fat diets (Hill’s w/d) have also been shown to improve overall digestive health and alleviate the constipation, excess gas, and diarrhea associated with IBS in cats: Hill's Prescription Diet w/d Multi-Benefit dry cat food Hill’s Prescription Diet w/d Multi-Benefit wet cat food Adding a probiotic supplement to the diet can also promote a return to and maintenance of good gut bacteria.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_pruritus,"Itchiness, Desire to Scratch, Chew or Lick Causing Inflamed Skin in Cats","PetMD Editorial Pruritus is the medical term used to define a cat's sensation to itch, or the sensation that provokes its desire to scratch, rub, chew, or lick its hair and skin. Pruritis is also an indicator of inflamed skin. Intense scratching can eventually lead to partial or full hair loss, but with treatment, prognosis is positive. The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how pruritus affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Some of the most common symptoms seen in cats include: There are many causes of pruritus, including fleas, scabies, lice, allergies, bacterial infections, abnormal cell development (neoplasia), and immune disorders. A skin biopsy may be needed to determine the diagnosis, as there are many triggers that can cause skin itching and the desire to scratch. Allergy testing is often used to determine and localize the cause of the itching or desire to scratch. The treatment given will be dependent upon the underlying cause for the condition. If the cat's diet is causing the skin irritation and the desire to scratch, dietary modifications will be recommended. Medicine may be given orally, by injection, or as a medicated topical (external) ointment to minimize or eliminate the desire to scratch. Pruritus requires ongoing treatment and can be frustrating for the cat's owner if progress is not made. Administering the prescribed medications will help to reduce or eliminate the desire for the cat to scratch. Dietary modifications may also be called for. There are currently no known preventative measures, but with maintenance and treatment, recurrence can be avoided or minimized. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_synovial_sarcoma,Joint Cancer (Synovial Sarcoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The synovial membrane is the layer of soft tissue that lines the surfaces within the joints, such as those between the joints at the knees and elbows. Synovial sarcomas are soft tissue sarcomas – malignant cancers – that arise from the precursor cells outside the synovial membrane of the joints and bursa (the fluid-filled, sac-like cavity between joints that helps to facilitate movement). Precursor cells have the ability to differentiate into one or two closely related forms: epithelial cells (skin cells) or fibroblastic (connective tissue) cells. Consequently, the tumor may have cancer resembling both cancers of the skin and of the connective tissue. Synovial sarcomas are aggressive and highly locally invasive, spreading in greater than 40 percent of cases. They most often spread to the elbow, knee, and shoulder blade regions. This type of cancer is rare in cats. You will need to provide a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will then perform a complete physical exam and order standard laboratory tests, including a biochemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel to rule out other non-cancerous causes for your cat's symptoms. Visual diagnostic techniques will show abnormalities around the affected joints. X-rays of the mass will show that the tumor is involved in both the bone and the joint. To obtain a definitive diagnosis, a biopsy of the soft and bony tissue of the tumor is necessary for histologic evaluation (microscopic analysis of the tissue sample). Using fine-needle aspirates (removal of fluid), the regional lymph nodes (i.e., the lymph nodes of the groin, armpits) should also be sampled and tested for evidence of metastasis (spread). The invasiveness of this type of sarcoma makes amputation (if possible) of the affected limb the treatment of choice. When appropriate, the patient should be treated with supportive chemotherapy. Pain medication will also be prescribed and administered as necessary. After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments with you for your cat every two to three months for the first year after diagnosis of the synovial sarcoma. After the first year your cat may be seen by your veterinarian every six months for follow-up exams, and to affirm that the cancer has not recurred. X-rays should be taken at each visit to check for local recurrence and to confirm that the cancer has not spread to the lungs. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_polyarthritis_erosive_immune_mediated,Joint Cartilage Erosion in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Erosive, immune-mediated polyarthritis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the joints, in which the cartilage of the cat's joint (articular cartilage) is eroded away. Leukocyte cells, leukocyte enzymes (catalyzing reactions), cell-mediated immunity, immune complexes (an antibody bound to its triggering antigen), and autoallergic reactions are all directed against cartilage components. This leads to an inflammatory response by the tissue surrounding the cartilage, and protein activation (complement) in response to the immunity displaying cells. Destructive enzymes, which are released from inflammatory cells, damage the articular cartilage, synoviocytes (cells which produce a lubricating fluid, called synovia, for the joints), and chondrocytes (cartilage cells), leading to erosive changes in the joints. The condition or disease described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Symptoms for cats are often cyclic, coming and going at random intervals. These symptoms include: The typical onset of immune-mediated erosive polyarthritis in cats is from one to five years of age and the most common type of the disease is feline chronic progressive polyarthritis (FCCP). The suspected causes for this form of joint cartillage erosion are T lymphocyte effector cells that carry out the attack response, and an abnormal antigenic response to the host antibody. That is, an immune response to a substance that stimulates production of antibodies, an antigen, which acts as a “trigger.” Other known causes include: You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking note of signs of pain, decreased range of motion, and any lameness. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel. Joint fluid aspirate will be taken for lab analysis, and submitted for bacterial culture and sensitivity. A biopsy of synovial tissue will also help to make a definitive diagnosis. X-ray images can also be used as a diagnostic tool. If an erosive, immune-mediated polyarthritis condition is present, it will be visible on the radiograph image. Physical therapy, including range-of-motion exercises, massage, and swimming can help treat severe disease. Bandages and/or splints may be placed around the joint to prevent further degradation of the cartilage, especially in cats that are experiencing difficulty walking. Weight loss also helps decrease pressure on the joints if the cat is overweight. Surgery for this condition is generally not recommended. However, total hip replacements, and femoral head ostectomy (surgical removal of part of the thigh bone) may be considered. Arthrodesis of the carpus (wrist) is generally quite successful for treating joint pain and instability. Arthrodesis of the shoulder, elbow, stifle (knee), or hock (ankle), meanwhile, is not as reliable at yielding positive results. Your veterinarian will schedule frequent follow-up appointments to examine your cat's progress. If your cat’s condition continues to worsen, you must contact your veterinarian immediately for care.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_joint_luxation,Joint Dislocation in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Bones provide a rigid framework to body, helping maintain its normal shape, as well as protecting vital organs of the body. A joint is a structure where two or more bones meet (articulate) together. A capsule is present in articulating joints, which has a thick fibrous layer that helps in stabilizing the joint. In most joints, ligaments are also present, which ensure movements of joints within normal ranges. Therefore, if joints become damaged, disrupted, or undergo abnormal development, they become unstable. The term luxation is used for the dislocation and complete disruption of a joint. In this condition, the supporting structures, like ligaments present around the joint, are damaged or completely missing. A milder form of this disease, called subluxation, represents partial dislocation of a joint. There are two basic forms of joint luxation: trauma-induced luxation or congenital, which is present at birth. The latter form is aggravated by stress at later stages. Your veterinarian will take a detailed history of your cat, asking you about the nature and frequency of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination on the cat, especially the areas around the joints. Your veterinarian will also order multiple X-rays of the affected joints, which will help in confirming the diagnosis. This is because the results of routine laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, are usually normal in affected animals if there is no other concurrent disease present. The major goal of treatment is to provide complete rest in order to reduce swelling and pain. The joint may need to be stabilized to prevent further aggravation of symptoms. Bandages are usually applied to stabilize the affect joint(s), and cold compresses are applied to reduce inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be required to correct the abnormality. Cage rest in a stress-free location in your home is very important for complete recovery, as activity may increase the likelihood of further aggravation. Your veterinarian will also recommend a weight loss plan for your cat, as obesity may cause further stress on the affected joint in the long run. Recurrence after treatment is common, which makes prognosis very poor in such cases. If surgery is conducted to stabilize the joint and correction of defects, your cat may feel some soreness for a few days. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications for pain control, which may need to be administered for few days at home. Call him or her if you see any untoward symptoms after surgery.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_dysautonomia_key_gaskell_syndrome,Key-Gaskell Syndrome in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Dysautonomia is characterized by a malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the system that controls the heart rate, respiration, digestion, urination, salivation, perspiration, eye pupil dilation,blood pressure, intestinal contractions, glandular activity, and physical arousal. The body functions that occur within the ANS are largely performed without conscious thought, with the exception of breathing, which works in coordination with conscious thought. This condition is also referred to as Key-Gaskell syndrome. This is a rare condition, but when it does occur, it tends to affect cats younger than three years. Otherwise, there is no gender or age that is specifically affected. However, there is some geographical correlation tied to feline dysautonomia, with higher incidences occurring in the West and Midwest, such as California, Indiana, Kansas, and Oklahoma, as well as in the United Kingdom. Treatment is based on the primary symptoms and the prognosis for recovery is guarded. The underlying cause is unknown. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical exam on your cat. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected by this condition. X-rays will show megaesophagus (enlargement of the esophagus), distended intestinal loops with no peristalsis (the normal contraction of the intestinal muscles) and a distended urinary bladder. Loss of nerve control in the iris of the eye will cause it to be hypersensitive to cholinergic drugs, affecting the response time for the iris of the eye to contract. Where a cat unaffected with Key-Gaskell will have a normal response time of 30 minutes, a cat affected with this condition will have an abnormally fast pupil constriction reaction. An atropine challenge test will be given to test the heart's response – a healthy cat will have a rise in heart activity (tachycardia) in response to the atropine, where a cat affected with Key-Gaskell will have no increase in heart rate. Histamine injections may be given to test for sympathetic loss of capillary function. If there is loss of capillary function, there will be no visible reactive response in the skin, or a welt but no flare in the skin. These tests will help your veterinarian to make a compete assessment of the autonomic nervous system's (made up of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems) ability to function in a healthy manner. The cause of dysautonomia is unknown. Thus, treatment is symptomatic. Intravenous (IV) fluids should be given to the cat to prevent dehydration. A feeding tube may help ensure adequate nutrition if megaesophagus is present. If intestinal motility is absent, a feeding tube may be necessary. Artificial tears should be administered if tear production is insufficient. Humidification of the air may help with dry mucous membranes. The bladder should be manually expressed for the cat. Medications will be given for supporting the organs, and for encouraging bladder contraction and improving intestinal motility. If infections or pneumonia are suspected, antibiotics will be prescribed. Prognosis for cats with dysautonomia is guarded. Most cats that are afflicted with this disease will not survive, as many die of aspiration pneumonia or need to be euthanized due to poor quality of life. Animals that do survive can take more than a year to fully recover and often have some degree of permanent autonomic dysfunction, which may require that they be given constant care.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_adenocarcinoma_renal,Kidney Cancer (Adenocarcinoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Adenocarcinoma of the kidneys is an extremely rare neoplasm in cats. When it does occur, it commonly affects older cats. There is no breed predisposition in cats for this type of tumor. Like other adenocarcinomas, adenocarcinoma of the kidney is very aggressive, growing rapidly and metastasizing to other parts and organs of the body. Another version of kidney adenocarcinoma, known as cystadenocarcinoma, is less aggressive; affected cats survive for longer period of time as compared to those with adenocarcinoma. The symptoms are mostly non-specific and include: The exact cause of adenocarcinoma of kidney is still unknown. It is categorized as idiopathic. Your veterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. The doctor will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood count, biochemical profile, and a urinalysis to rule out or confirm other causes for these symptoms. Urinalysis remains crucial in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the kidneys, as it will provide important clues toward the final diagnosis. The presence of blood, proteins, and bacteria in the blood will be determined, and a urine culture will be performed to rule out any infectious causes. Sometimes, tumor cells are also seen in the urine, which is sufficient for establishing a preliminary diagnosis. Further diagnostics include X-ray and ultrasound imaging, which will demonstrate the presence, size, location and other important information regarding the tumor. If required, your veterinarian will also take a small tissue sample of the kidneys (kidney biopsy) to establish a confirmatory diagnosis. In some cases – as a last resort – surgery may be required to take a sample of the neoplasm for a definitive diagnosis. There is no single curative treatment for renal adenocarcinoma, but surgery is performed in the majority of cases. Complete resection (removal) of the carcinoma tissue, along with some normal tissue, is done. There are some chemotherapeutic agents that may also be used in some patients but the success rate is quite low. Patients with renal failure or other complications will be treated to prevent further aggravation of symptoms. As no definitive treatment is available yet, cats with renal adenocarcinoma may have few months to live even if the tumor is small and well-localized. If surgery is performed, your veterinarian will recommend serial urine and blood testing along with radiographs to monitor re-growth of the tumor. These patients usually have several complications, like kidney failure, and will need to be monitored on a regular basis. During this time you can improve your cat's quality of life by keeping it comfortable and protecting it from stressful situations. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines, especially in giving chemotherapeutic agents at home. Many chemotherapeutic agents can be hazardous to your health if not handled properly; consult with your veterinarian on the best handling practices. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_polycystic_kidney_disease,Kidney Disease Caused by Multiple Cysts in Cats,"PetMD Editorial When large portions of a cat's renal parenchyma -- the functional tissue of the animal's kidneys which are normally differentiated -- are displaced by multiple cysts, the medical condition is referred to as polycystic kidney disease. A cyst is a closed sac that may be filled with air, fluid, or semi-solid material. Renal cysts (a closed sac that may be filled with air, fluid, or semi-solid material) develop in pre-existing nephrons (the functional filtering cells of the kidney tissue) and in the collecting ducts of the organ. Invariably, the disease affects both of the cat's kidneys. Although polycystic kidney disease is usually not immediately life-threatening, it should be treated as early as possible to prevent cyst progression and development of secondary bacterial infection, either of which may lead to sepsis, the presence of pus-forming toxic organisms in the blood. Both dogs and cats may develop polycystic kidney disease, with some breeds more susceptible than others. Persian and other Persian-related breeds of cats, including Himalayans and Scottish Folds, are affected more frequently than other breeds. If you would like to learn more about how this disease affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Polycystic kidney disease may be difficult to detect in the initial stages. The cysts often remain undetected until they become large and numerous enough to contribute to kidney failure or an enlarged abdomen. Most cats do not exhibit any symptoms during initial stages of cyst formation and growth. Once the disease has progressed, bosselated (lumpy) kidneys may be detected. This is discovered during an abdominal palpatation, in which the abdominal muscles twitch uncontrollably. Most renal cysts are not painful, so the cat may not exhibit any discomfort, but secondary infection associated with the cysts may result in later discomfort. Polycystic kidney disease is known to be an inherited disorder in Persian cats. Of course, the disease is not limited to this breed, as other cat breeds are susceptible to it as well. Aside from this one known genetic factor, the exact stimuli for renal cysts is not precisely known. Environmental and endogenous factors also appear to influence the development of this disease. Endogenous compounds that are believed to contribute to cyst development include the parathyroid hormone (a hormone secreted by the parathyroid hormones of the endocrine system) and vasopressin (a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus area of the brain). One diagnostic procedure that may be used if polycystic kidney disease is suspected is an evaluation of the fluids through fine needle aspirates of the cat's kidney (in which fluid is removed via needle), which may help to pinpoint the origination of the cysts. Additional diagnostic procedures that may be required include abdominal ultrasounds, which may reveal the presence of cysts in some organs, a urine analysis, and an examination of cystic fluid. A bacterial culture of cyst fluids can be done to determine if secondary infection has developed and needs to be treated. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, may also be present. If polycystic kidney disease is not the cause of the cat’s symptoms, alternate diagnoses may include an unnatural cell growth, such as tumor in the kidney, kidney failure, and a variety of other cystic diseases of the kidneys. Elimination of renal cysts is not possible at this time, thus treatment is often limited to minimizing the consequences of cyst formation, such as infection in the kidneys. Periodic removal of fluid from large renal cysts with a needle (a process known as aspiration) can be used to minimize pain and reduce cyst volume, and a number of medications may be prescribed to deal with symptoms and secondary complications, such as bacterial infection. Cats with polycystic kidney disease should be monitored every two to six months for associated diseases, such as kidney infection, kidney failure, and increased pain. If bacterial infection and associated sepsis (the presence of pus-forming and toxic organisms in the blood) does not occur, the short-term prognosis is favorable -- even without treatment. The long-term prognosis for cats with polycystic kidney diseases usually depends on the severity of the condition, and any subsequent progression to kidney failure. Because the exact cause of polycystic kidney disease is unknown, there is no specific preventative measure that can be taken. It is all but impossible to eradicate the disease through selective breeding of unaffected cats, since almost 40 percent of Persians are affected. Additionally, selective breeding may reduce genetic diversity, thereby increasing the frequency of other unwanted inherited traits in these breeds. Owners of Persians and Persian-related breeds should be familiar with the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease so that a proactive approach can be taken.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_congenital_developmental_renal_diseases,Kidney Disease (Congenital) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Congenital (existing at birth) and developmental kidney diseases are part of a group of diseases in which the kidney may be abnormal in its ability to function normally, or may be abnormal in appearance, or both. These diseases result from inherited or genetic problems or disease processes that affect the development and growth of the kidney before or shortly after birth. Most patients are less than five years of age at the time of diagnosis. Symptoms: Types: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms and any possible incidents that might have led to this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and any information on your cat's family history that you are familiar with. Your veterinarian will order a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. Abdominal x-rays, abdominal ultrasound and an excretory urography (x-ray of your cat urinating) will all be performed to identify and characterize the kidney disease your cat is suffering form. There are some direct genetic tests that are available for detection of specific genetic mutations associated with familial polycystic renal disease in Persian and Persian-derived breeds of cats. Treatment for patients suffering from kidney disorders is often supportive or symptomatic. Without a kidney transplant, there is no cure for developmental or congenital kidney disease. Cats with high blood pressure should be switched to a low salt diet, and cats with chronic kidney failure should have phosphorous restricted and protein intake moderately restricted. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat to monitor the progression of the kidney disease. Animals with developmental or congenital kidney disease should not be bred; neutering is highly advised under these conditions. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/kidney-disease-cats,"Kidney Disease in Cats: Signs, Causes, and Treatment","iStock/Phynart Studio Kidney disease is one of the most common diseases in cats, and the chances of it occurring increase as the cat gets older. There are many causes of kidney disease in cats, including injury to the kidney, hereditary conditions, and underlying medical conditions. Early detection and treatment are key to providing the best chance for cats to live longer with a better quality of life. A cat has two kidneys, one on each side of the abdomen, and they play a vital role in filtering waste from the body. Additionally, the kidneys serve to regulate the body’s balance of fluids, minerals, and electrolytes. They conserve water and protein and play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and red blood cell production by making a hormone called erythropoietin. There are different types of kidney disease in cats and various underlying causes. Many of these conditions are progressive in nature and debilitating, which can be life-threatening. When enough damage has occurred (losing about two-thirds of kidney function), signs become apparent and regeneration will not occur, leading to chronic kidney disease. Chronic renal failure (CRF), renal insufficiency, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are medical terms used interchangeably to describe the same condition. Feline kidney disease can be caused by a variety of factors: Injury to the kidney: For some cats, the disease could have occurred after a serious kidney injury; from a severe infection (including feline infectious peritonitis , toxoplasmosis , and pyelonephritis ); ingestion of a toxic substance (like antifreeze, lilies, or rat poison); and from certain medications (like NSAIDs for people, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen). Hereditary: For others, it could be inherited, as with polycystic kidney disease (a specific type of renal disease in cats) and amyloidosis, a rare organ disease seen primarily in Abyssinians. Underlying medical condition: It could also be attributed to underlying immune-mediated diseases, stroke-like events, clotting disorders, heart disease, and even cancers like lymphoma. Even with the best testing, in some cases, the underlying cause remains unknown. So, what does cat kidney disease look like? Clinical signs of kidney disease in cats are often related to the severity of the kidney disease and underlying cause. Most cats will exhibit symptoms including: Increased thirst Changes in frequency of urination or inability to urinate Vomiting Dehydration Sores in the mouth Foul breath (usually an ammonia-like odor) Weight loss Muscle wasting Decreased appetite and nausea Changes in body temperature ( fever or, in late stages, hypothermia ) Urinary accidents Edema (fluid-filled swelling in the limbs) Constipation Changes in behavior (such as hiding, decreased activity , or acting aloof) High blood pressure Health Tools Provide a few details about what’s going on, and our vet-created Symptom Checker will quickly help you find out what to do next. Kidney disease is often diagnosed based on routine blood work and a urinalysis, looking specifically at such kidney markers as: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): This is a by-product of protein metabolism. Higher values may indicate kidney failure. Creatinine (CREA): Measuring the amount of creatinine , a waste product indicates, how well kidneys are filtering waste from blood. Phosphorus: Elevated phosphorus levels typically indicate kidney failure. Electrolytes: Sodium, potassium, and chloride are often affected by the primary disease—but also by secondary factors, such as vomiting and a lack of appetite. Calcium: Elevated levels, though not as common, are often seen as the disease advances. Red blood cell count: Anemia, low red blood cell count, may indicate kidney failure. White blood cell count: If high, it may indicate infection or inflammation. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA): Measuring for this amino acid is an additional test to help determine if kidney disease is present. It can be used for early detection of kidney disease. Urine specific gravity: This is a marker of how diluted or concentrated the urine is. Usually, the lower the number, the more diluted the urine. This may indicate kidney disease, since a healthy kidney should be able to resorb water to concentrate urine to prevent dehydration. Urine sediment: These are microscopic solids in the urine that are checked for bacteria, white/red blood cells, crystals, epithelial cells and casts. Certain cells and casts can indicate kidney damage. Bacteria and white blood cells indicate infection. Your veterinarian will most likely recommend additional diagnostic testing, including: A urine protein to creatinine (UPC) ratio to quantify how much protein is being lost in the urine. A urine culture , because cats with CKD are more likely to acquire urinary tract infections . A blood pressure evaluation to determine if high blood pressure can be a cause or manifestation of kidney disease. Radiographs or abdominal ultrasound to screen for kidney stones, infarcts (areas of dead tissue), and cysts. A kidney biopsy to determine the type of glomerular (filtering unit of the kidney) disease present. A thyroid panel to rule out hyperthyroidism . Kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, and high blood pressure frequently occur together in older cats. Once diagnosed, feline kidney disease is then classified into four stages based on the severity of clinical signs and laboratory values: Stage I: Clinical signs are usually not apparent Stage II: Some clinical signs are noted Stage III: Many clinical signs are noted, and cats often appear to feel sick Stage IV: A majority of clinical signs are noted, and cats often present in crisis Kidney disease is managed mostly with the aid of medications, diet, and hydration. Specific management is geared toward the underlying cause (if known) as well as the stage of the disease. A cat in any stage with an increase in either UPC or high blood pressure will most likely be treated with medication. Based on the cause, additional therapy may be instituted, such as: Aggressive IV antibiotics, if infection is present Deworming medication for parasites Immunosuppressive-type drugs for auto-immune diseases Antithrombotics (to prevent blood clot formation) Chemotherapy and/or surgery (if cancer is part of the underlying cause) If a urinary obstruction is noted, relieving the obstruction would be the treatment of choice. Throughout your cat’s life, any disease process or illness that could affect hydration should be treated promptly with IV fluids. Drugs prescribed in the future for any other disease process will need to be tailored or substituted for a more kidney-friendly alternative, given that kidney metabolism will be decreased. If not, overdosages and/or worsening of the kidney disease could occur. Additionally, for all stages of kidney disease, fresh water should always be available. Drinking should be encouraged and adequate nutrition should be given daily. Cats diagnosed with kidney disease are often prescribed a therapeutic renal diet, like those in the Royal Canin Veterinary Diet kidney support range . Available only with your vet’s approval, these diets typically are formulated with lower amounts of high-quality protein and low phosphorus levels to help reduce the level of waste products in the bloodstream. To help with hydration, your vet may recommend feeding your cat canned, wet foods that contain additional water, such as Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Adult Renal Support D Thin Slices in Gravy Canned Cat Food . Cats diagnosed early on with kidney disease will benefit from nutritional management and more frequent veterinary attention, which may include more regular checkups and blood work. Cats in stages I and II may often be monitored for further progression of signs, and some may be given a therapeutic diet specifically geared to help the kidneys by limiting the amount of work they have to do. Many cats can go on to have a decent quality of life for many months or years, depending on the specific diagnosis. Cats in stages III and IV often require more medical and dietary assistance: If secondary anemia is present, erythropoietin injections or an oral medication called Varenzin-CA1 can be given at the direction of your veterinarian. Dietary supplements may be prescribed to help with hypokalemia ( low potassium). Phosphorus binders may be prescribed to treat high phosphorus levels. Anti-nausea, anti-emetic (anti-vomiting), or appetite-stimulating medications can be given to cats with nausea, vomiting, or poor appetite. Fluids given either intravenously or underneath the skin can help with dehydration, and your veterinarian can show you how to administer these fluids at home . Medication to lower blood pressure, such as Semintra , may be prescribed if the cat has hypertension. Because of the severity of signs often seen in cats in stages III and IV and the amount of care and effort required to support these cats, some may be humanely euthanized . Some causes of kidney disease may be preventable (such as toxicologic causes), but unfortunately, most causes are not. Heritable conditions, for example, are not preventable, but affected cats, or cats with the genetic copies of the disease, should not be bred. To limit your cat’s exposure to toxins, keep lilies out of the home and block off access to the garage, household cleaners, and medications. Limiting exposure to stray cats who may be carriers of disease, like FIP, that could cause kidney disease, as well as keeping your cat up to date on vaccines and monthly heartworm and flea control is recommended. Be sure to schedule wellness exams that include blood and urine testing, especially for senior cats . If you notice any of the above signs of kidney disease in cats, take your cat to a veterinarian for examination as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and intervention are keys to maintaining quality of life. The life expectancy of a cat with kidney disease varies depending on the underlying cause and the stage at which the disease is diagnosed. Cats in the earlier stages are more likely to live longer if the underlying disease is treated appropriately. Some urinary issues, like obstructions and infection, are painful and can lead to kidney disease. End stage kidney disease can be debilitating, and cause a poor quality of life. Some cats that experience acute kidney trauma can recover, although there may be long-term effects that can lead to chronic kidney failure. Cats in chronic kidney failure will not recover, as it is not curable. However, depending on the stage of kidney failure they are in when diagnosed, their lab values, and how well they respond to treatment, some cats can go on to live a relatively normal life, with some lifestyle changes and long-term management.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_renomegaly,Kidney Enlargement in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Renomegaly is a condition in which one or both kidneys are abnormally large, confirmed by abdominal palpation, ultrasounds, or X-rays. The cat's respiratory, nervous, hormonal, urinary and digestive systems are all affected by this condition. In addition, renomegaly is not exclusive to cats, dogs can suffer from it, too. If you would like to learn more about how this condition affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. There are occasions when the cat is asymptomatic, or does not display any signs whatsoever. However, some of the more common symptoms seen in cats with renomegaly include: The kidneys may become abnormally large as a result of inflammation, infection, or cancer. Renomegaly can also occur due to urinary tract obstruction, degeneration of the urinary tubes (ureters), formation of cysts in the urinary tract, various infections, abscesses, inflammatory conditions, genetically transmitted diseases, clots in the kidneys, and toxins in the system. Exposure to infections such as leptospirosis or leukemia may also lead to renomegaly. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis; cats will also have blood drawn for feline leukemia testing. A palpation exam and X-rays will also be performed to assist your veterinarian in visualizing the extent of abnormality in the kidney size, and thus diagnose your cat's condition. For cats with cancer, thoracic X-rays will help your doctor to determine if the cancer has spread. Ultrasonography, which uses sound waves, will also help distinguish the structural details of internal organs so that your doctor can determine the amount of renal swelling, or detect irregularities in other organs. Aspiration of renal fluid and a biopsy is another procedure which may be performed on your cat. Your cat will be treated on an outpatient basis unless it is suffering from dehydration or renal failure. Treatment will begin with diagnosing and treating the underlying cause, maintaining fluid balance with intravenous fluids, if necessary, and replenishing minerals and electrolytes. If your cat is otherwise healthy, a normal diet and normal exercise will be advised. Drugs prescribed by your veterinarian will vary according to the underlying cause of the renomegaly. However, drugs that may have a toxic effect on the kidneys should be avoided. Your veterinarian will want to see your cat during regular follow-up examinations, where he or she will assess the cat's physical recovery and hydration status. If your cat's symptoms return, you will need to contact the veterinarian immediately. Possible complications of renomegaly include kidney failure and hormone imbalances that mimic hormone-producing cancers. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_renal_failure_acute_uremia,Kidney Failure and Excess Urea in the Urine in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The sudden onset of abnormally high levels of urea, protein products, and amino acids in the cat's blood is referred to as acute uremia. This condition usually follows kidney injuries or occurs when the urinary tubes that connect the kidney to the bladder (ureters) are obstructed. As a result, the outflow of urine is obstructed, creating an imbalance in fluid regulation and leading to a buildup of potential toxins in the body. Fortunately, acute uremia can be successfully treated and cured if it is identified on time and treated promptly. Most cat breeds, whether male or female, are affected by acute uremia; however, exposure to chemicals such as antifreeze increases the risk of uremia. Therefore, the incidence of acute uremia is higher in the winter and fall than in other seasons. The condition described in this medical article can affect both dogs and cats. If you would like to learn how acute uremia affects dogs, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. As this potentially toxic blood flows through the cat's body, most systems are affected, including the urinary, digestive, nervous, respiratory, musculoskeletal, lymphatic, and immune systems. Upon examination, cats will appear to be in normal physical condition, but may appear to be in a depressed state. When symptoms are apparent, signs can include loss of appetite, listlessness, vomiting, and diarrhea, which may be tinted with blood. Other symptoms may include inflammation of the tongue, ammonia-smelling breath (due to the urea), ulcers in the mouth, fever, abnormally fast or slow pulse, decreased or increased urine output, and even seizures. The kidneys may feel enlarged, tender, and firm on palpation. Kidney failure or obstruction to urine output may be due to any of the following: A complete blood profile will be conducted by your veterinarian, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Cats with acute uremia may have high packed cell volume and an increased white blood cell count. The levels of certain protein enzymes and chemicals such as creatinine, phosphate, glucose, and potassium will also be high. Urine may be collected by inserting a catheter or a fine needle aspiration into the cat; the results of which may show high levels of protein, glucose, and the presence of blood cells. In order to view and examine the urinary system clearly, contrast dyes may be injected into the bladder so that the interior of the bladder, the ureters, and the kidney are illuminated on the X-ray and ultrasonography imaging. If the uremia is due to toxic poisoning, the first step will be to eliminate the toxins from the body. This may be done through gastric lavage, where the stomach is cleansed, or by administering activated charcoal to neutralize the toxin. Specific antidotes may also be administered if the toxic agent can be identified. Care is also aimed at re-establishing fluid balance, blood circulation, and in establishing the balance of chemicals in the blood. Strictly monitoring fluid intake, food consumption, and nutrition is very important while treatment is underway. Some medications that may be prescribed are: Based on your cat's response to these drugs, your veterinarian might also recommend dialysis or surgery. Generally, this condition has a poor prognosis for recovery. Some potential complications include seizures, coma, high blood pressure, pneumonia, bleeding in the digestive tract, cardiac arrest, fluid overload, widespread infection in the blood, and multiple organ failure. The cost involved of treating an animal with acute uremia may also very high. Sometimes, dialysis can be used until the cat is stable enough to tolerate surgery. After the procedures are complete, it is important to monitor daily fluid levels, mineral levels, body weight, urine output, and general physical status. The entire process of recovery depends on various factors, such as the extent of organ or system damage, the origin of the disease, and the existence of other pathological conditions or diseased organs.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/kidney-failure-in-cats,"Kidney Failure in Cats: Symptoms, Stages and Causes","Alina Lebed/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Kidneys serve many vital roles in the body, including filtering and removing waste in the form of urine. Kidneys maintain proper hydration by balancing water and electrolytes, creating the hormones responsible for red blood cell production, and regulating blood pressure. In addition, the kidneys help modify vitamin D so it can be used by the body. Like people, cats have two kidneys, one on each side of the abdomen. Unfortunately, kidney failure can occur when these organs become too damaged to work properly. Kidney failure usually develops because of chronic kidney disease . It takes a kidney losing more than 75% of its function before you start to see changes in routine blood work (such as in creatinine levels). Kidney failure in cats is a life-threatening situation, though treatments, like special therapeutic diets to support kidney function , can help extend their life. Early diagnosis and intervention are vital to managing the disease and helping to maintain your cat’s comfort and well-being. Kidney failure in cats can be described as acute or chronic. Also called acute renal failure (ARF), acute kidney failure in cats occurs when the kidneys are suddenly damaged, usually within hours or days. This may be due to poison or from a fast-acting infection. Cats with ARF may regain some kidney function with treatment, supportive care, and time, depending on the cause. Even with treatment, ARF is terminal in about 50% of cases . However, cats that do survive the initial cause usually have a better outcome compared to cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic kidney failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD), eventually leads to end-stage renal failure, or ESRF, which is considered stage 4 of kidney disease. In CKD, a gradual loss of kidney tissue occurs over a period of months (must be >2 months to be considered CKD) or years due to underlying genetic factors, chronic infections, age, cancer, or other underlying medical conditions. Clinical signs of chronic kidney disease show up when about two-thirds of normal kidney tissue has been lost. As it worsens, medical management becomes ineffective in helping the kidneys perform their crucial roles. Clinical signs of kidney failure in cats differ slightly, depending on if the condition is acute or final stages of CKD. In cats with acute kidney failure , symptoms include: Sudden onset of decreased appetite or anorexia Lethargy or listlessness Vomit , sometimes tinged with blood Diarrhea or bloody diarrhea Weight loss Ammonia-like odor to the breath (due to uremic toxins building up in the blood) Changes in urination ( increased frequency , large amounts or cessation) Drinking more water than normal , usually excessive Abdominal pain due to swollen kidneys (seen in cases of acute kidney failure in cats) Seizures In cats with end-stage kidney failure associated with chronic kidney disease, clinical signs include: Anorexia/refusal to eat Vomiting Weight loss Lethargy, excessive sleepiness Dehydration Confusion (possibly pacing and restlessness) Changes in behavior ( withdrawn , irritability ) Uncontrolled urination or defecation Drinking more water than normal Ammonia-like odor to the breath Seizures Decreasing body temperature Greasy, unkempt, thin hair coat Stages of kidney failure in cats is determined by their lab values as well as the symptoms they have. Let’s look at each stage of kidney failure in cats. Kidneys are damaged but no azotemia present. Azotemia is the measurement of waste accumulation in the blood as evident by increased creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). No clinical signs or symptoms noted. This stage has the greatest chance of successful treatment. However, since there are no signs or lab value changes, it’s very rare to diagnose a cat with stage 1 kidney disease. Kidneys have started to decrease in their ability to filter waste out of the blood and azotemia is noted in blood work. The urine starts to become more diluted (containing more water) from poor kidney function. Urine specific gravity (USG) will decrease on urinalysis. Most cats have no signs or symptoms at this stage, but some cats will start to drink more water and urine more frequently/increased volume of urine produced (PU/PD). The kidneys continue to have decreased filtering ability. Azotemia becomes worse as more waste is concentrated in the blood. Cats will begin to show clinical signs. This final stage of kidney disease continues to worsen the kidneys’ ability to filter waste from the blood. This toxin buildup in the blood not only affects the kidneys but will start to affect other organs of the body. Cats begin to feel and act very sick. A cat’s bones can become soft and break easily . Brittle jaw bones can cause young cats’ teeth to fall out . Acute kidney failure has numerous causes, but it can be categorized as due to toxins or from an underlying medical issue. Toxin exposure may be caused by ingesting: Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) Lilies (all parts of the plant and the water in the vase are toxic by ingestion or inhalation) NSAIDs for people, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen Heavy metals like arsenic, lead , or mercury Rat poisons Underlying medical issues can include: Urethral obstructions (inability to urinate) Low blood pressure Clotting disorders Heart disease Pyelonephritis (infection in the kidneys) Parasitic infections (toxoplasmosis or kidney worms) Tick-borne diseases Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) Trauma or severe allergic reactions that result in shock Chronic kidney disease eventually progresses to end-stage kidney disease and kidney failure. How quickly this happens is hard to predict. It’s very common in geriatric cats, and some breeds have a higher risk , such as: Abyssinians Burmese Maine Coons Persians Ragdolls Russian Blues Siamese Other risk factors include: Tumors and cancer (such as lymphoma ) Viruses specific to cats, such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Chronic pyelonephritis (a slow-developing infection in the kidneys) Underlying genetic disorders like polycystic kidney disease or amyloidosis Immune-mediated disorders Previous acute renal failure/acute kidney injuries that did not fully respond to treatment Underlying medical conditions, like hyperthyroidism Use of certain medications In cases of acute renal failure in cats, blood work, urine samples , and imaging (X-rays and ultrasound) will likely be performed to diagnose the condition and help determine the best course of treatment. Your cat will be thoroughly examined by their veterinarian and their blood pressure will be obtained as well. Your veterinarian will look for signs of: Anemia Elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine Abnormal hydration levels, by measuring electrolyte concentration (sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus) Dilute urine or signs of infection in the urine High or low blood pressure Large or small kidneys Options for treating end-stage kidney failure in cats are limited. They include strategies to manage kidney disease such as special diet, supplements, and anti-nausea medication. With proper treatment, cats with as little as 5% kidney function can survive for a long time. One of the most important treatments for cats with any kind of kidney disease is being on a restricted diet to help with their hydration as well as to decrease the toxin buildup in the blood. Cats with CKD fed a renal support diet live twice as long as cats fed a maintenance diet. The most successful diets are veterinary diets like Blue Buffalo Natural Veterinary Diet Kidney + Mobility Support , Royal Canin Renal Support or Hills k/d . These diets are restricted in protein and phosphorus to help decrease azotemia and low sodium to help with hydration. They also contain amino acids (to help muscle mass) and omega-3 fatty acids (to support kidney health and decrease inflammation). Antinausea medications such as Cerenia and antacids like famotidine are useful to help control stomach upset stemming from kidney disease. Depending on your cats' symptoms other medications might be needed—such appetite stimulants (ex: mirtazipine ) and blood pressure medication. Purina Hydra Care is an excellent supplement for cats with kidney disease. It’s designed to help your cat drink more water, which promotes kidney function. Supplements can also be given to cats with kidney disease to help decrease their azotemia and promote kidney function such as AminAvast and VetriScience . Speak with your veterinarian before giving your cat any supplements to ensure it is safe to give to them—they know your cat’s medical history best. In many cases, hospitalization with intravenous (IV) fluids and the placement of a feeding tube can stabilize the cat. Some respond well and may be able to return home for continued management of their underlying kidney disease. For more intensive treatment, hemodialysis (treatment to filter a cat’s blood) is available. This will not cure kidney failure but may improve quality of life. However, few veterinary clinics possess the necessary equipment, and the cost of hemodialysis for cats is very high. This treatment requires working with a board-certified veterinary internal medicine specialist and consultation with a member of the American Society of Veterinary Nephrology and Urology . Kidney transplant is another experimental route, but this has not widely been used and would require working with specialists to determine if your cat is a good candidate. When a cat has kidney failure, it’s important to work closely with your veterinarian to discuss prognosis, strategies to monitor quality of life, and when humane euthanasia should be considered . The prognosis for kidney failure in cats is poor. At some point, medical management will not keep a cat comfortable and end-of-life planning will need to be discussed with your vet. This is one of the hardest decisions a pet parent can make. Your veterinarian can help you understand questions about your cat’s quality of life. They’ll also help you develop a plan should humane euthanasia need to be considered outside of normal business hours. While few types of kidney failure in cats can be prevented, unfortunately, most cases can’t. However, kidney failure in cats due to toxin ingestion is highly preventable. Never bring lilies—or bouquets of flowers including lilies—into the home because of their extreme toxicity to cats. All medications and cleaners should be kept in safe containers and away from places where a cat could get into them. Limit your cat’s time in the garage, as chemicals like antifreeze can cause kidney failure in cats. Most cases of kidney disease in cats are genetic, therefore the only way to control this is by not breeding affected cats. Cats with acute kidney failure are often in decent pain, due to kidney enlargement and abdominal distention. Urinary issues—such as an obstruction or infection—are painful as well and can cause kidney disease. With chronic kidney disease, it’s often a gradual change over many months to years, so it is less likely to be painful. Cats in stage 1 and 2 kidney failure can have a long life if treated appropriately. These cats can live many years on a special diet and various medications and supplements as well as routine exams by their veterinarian to assess for any progression on disease. Cats in stage 3 and 4 kidney failure require aggressive treatment and management, usually involving hospitalization. Their life expectancy depends on what symptoms they have and how well they respond to treatment. Humane euthanasia is often chosen for these cats with stage 3 or 4 kidney disease. The earliest sign of kidney disease in cats is polyuria and polydipsia (PU/PD). Polyuria is an increase in frequency of urination. This can be in large or small amounts and can often cause a cat to have urinary accidents outside of the litterbox. Polydipsia refers to a cats increase in thirst causing them to drink excessive amounts of water. This might even include a cat seeking water in bizarre places like drinking from the toilet or sink.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_nephrotic_syndrome,Kidney Filtration Problems in Cats,"PetMD Editorial One of the body’s main methods for disposing of waste products is through the establishment and formation of urine. This process occurs in the kidney, where penetrable clusters of capillaries called glomeruli function to filter waste from the blood, thus establishing the formation of urine. When filtration cells (podocytes) in the kidney’s glomeruli become damaged, due either to immune complexes in the blood (called glomerulonephritis), or to dense deposits of hard protein (amyloid) - the abnormal accumulation of which is called amyloidosis - degeneration of the kidney’s tubular system occurs. This degeneration of the tubular system is medically referred to as nephrotic syndrome. Patients with nephrotic syndrome lose too many necessary proteins into the urine; a condition medically termed as proteinuria. Two of these proteins are albumin, which helps to maintain blood pressure and keep blood in the vessels, and antithrombin III, which prevents blood clots from forming. When greater than 3.5g of proteins are lost each day, blood pressure falls, and less blood stays in the blood vessels. Consequently, the kidneys act to conserve sodium in the body, which results in swelling of the limbs, hypertension and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity. When crucial thyroid proteins, which control the body’s metabolic rate, are also lost into the urine, signs of hypothyroidism can also be seen. There is a decreased break-down of cholesterol, and the affected cat will often show signs of muscle wasting. In addition, the liver also increases its production of proteins and lipids, further raising the levels of cholesterol-rich lipids circulating in the blood. This can lead to arteriosclerosis, diminished blood circulation due to thickening, and hardening of the arterial walls. Also, since proteins essential for breaking down blood clots are lost into the urine, the blood coagulates much more easily and blood clots can become lodged in blood vessels, causing paralysis or strokes. If left untreated, progressive glomerular disease can lead to urea nitrogen and creatinine (a metabolic waste product) accumulation in the bloodstream. That is, the accumulation of metabolic waste products in the bloodstream, which could lead to long-term kidney failure. This disease is relatively rare in cats. Long-term inflammatory conditions which could predispose cats to developing glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, along with a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count (CBC), an electrolyte panel, and a urinalysis. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected secondarily. Protein electrophoresis may help to identify which proteins are being lost into the urine through the kidneys so that a prognosis can be established. X-ray and ultrasound imaging will show if there has been a loss of detail in the abdominal cavity due to fluid seeping into the abdominal cavity (effusion). If glomerular disease is the cause of the nephrotic syndrome, mild enlargement of the kidneys may also be observed. The majority of patients can be treated on an outpatient basis, but if your cat is showing signs of severe nitrogenous waste in the bloodstream (azotemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), or blocked vessels due to clotting (thromboembolic disease), it should be hospitalized. Your veterinarian may prescribe medication to stop the loss of protein into your cat's urine and increase blood pressure. You will need to limit your cat's activity in order to prevent thromboembolic disease. A low-protein, low-sodium diet, perhaps one that is specially formulated for strengthening the kidney, should be fed to your cat. Your veterinarian will assist you in creating the best diet plan for your cat. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments for your cat at one month after the initial treatment, and then again at three month intervals for the year following. At each visit, a chemical blood profile, a urinalysis, and an electrolyte panel will be performed. The chemical blood profile is useful for monitoring kidney function, and the urinalysis will indicate the amount of protein being lost into the urine. Your doctor will also take your cat's blood pressure and monitor its weight at each visit. Glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis are progressive. If the underlying cause cannot be resolved, your cat will eventually lose all kidney function. The prognosis for end-stage kidney disease is poor. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/kidney-infections-cats,Kidney Infections in Cats,"The kidneys are two organs in a cat’s abdomen. They filter toxins from the body and excrete these toxins via urination. They also work to direct electrolyte and protein shifts in the body, which are important for normal body functions. Kidney infection (also termed pyelonephritis) affects the renal pelvis, a funnel-like portion inside the kidney that filters urine from the kidney to the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder). Infections that develop in the kidneys are termed upper urinary tract infections. Infections that occur in the bladder and urethra are called lower urinary tract infections. Kidney infections are uncommon in cats, but lower urinary tract infections are very common. Some cats are more prone to kidney infections than others, including cats with diabetes mellitus ; cats with chronic kidney disease ; cats prone to lower urinary tract infections ; cats with urinary tract stones; and those born with immune issues ( feline leukemia or feline immunodeficiency virus ) or congenital issues with their kidneys, such as amyloidosis or polycystic kidney disease. If left untreated, pyelonephritis can lead to kidney dysfunction, kidney failure, or sepsis, a bacterial infection that spreads to the bloodstream. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are critical. Symptoms of pyelonephritis can range from mild to severe. Often, no clinical signs are noted early in the condition. As it progresses, symptoms might include: Increased thirst or urination Straining to urinate Frequent urination with small amounts of urine produced Blood noted at the end of urination Urinating outside the litter box Fever Pain when touching kidneys or abdomen Vocalizing during urination Urine with an unpleasant odor Back pain Decreased appetite Vomiting Lethargy Pyelonephritis in cats is most commonly caused by E. coli or Staphylococcus bacterial infections. These infections usually start in the urethra or bladder, then move to the ureters. Some risk factors can make cats more prone to kidney infections. These include malformations such as ectopic ureters and renal dysplasia; and medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, kidney failure, stones in the urinary tract, chronic steroid administration, urine retention for long periods, and urinary catheterization—which can introduce bacteria from the outside environment. Your veterinarian will likely already have or take a history of your cat and do a thorough physical examination as the first steps in diagnosing a possible kidney infection. They will likely recommend full bloodwork to assess kidney enzymes, protein levels, electrolytes, and red and white blood cell counts. Bloodwork helps investigate for systemic diseases that can predispose cats to pyelonephritis, as listed above. Your veterinarian will also recommend a urinalysis to look for signs of infection in the urine, such as blood, protein, white blood cells, or bacteria. A urine culture is often also considered. This can allow the isolation of specific bacteria, which then helps determine the best antibiotics to fight off the infection. Abdominal radiographs and abdominal ultrasound are often used to help differentiate between lower and upper urinary tract infections. These will also allow investigation for urinary tract stones or congenital abnormalities that predispose cats to pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis treatment depends on the underlying cause. Cats are often treated as outpatients unless they are not eating well, are dehydrated, are clearly in pain, or have signs of sepsis or kidney failure. These more severe cases often require hospitalization with intravenous fluid therapy and intravenous antibiotics. Less severe cases (in cats that are well hydrated and are eating well) can be treated with oral antibiotics and sometimes pain medications. If other systemic diseases are causing the pyelonephritis, they will require appropriate therapy for resolution of the infection. Surgery is sometimes necessary if urinary tract stones are found—especially if they are noted within the bladder. These can be a source of infection and put cats at a high risk of urinary blockage (a medical emergency) Antibiotics are chosen based on urine culture results, which again help isolate the exact bacteria causing the infection. Antibiotic therapy for two to six weeks is usually necessary in cases of kidney infection. Often, your veterinarian will recheck a urine sample during or after completing antibiotics to ensure that the infection has been cleared entirely. Unfortunately, at-home therapy is not effective in treating pyelonephritis in cats, which is why a veterinary visit is so important. Cats with upper or lower urinary-tract disease are at a high risk of chronic, recurrent infections. Cats with chronic urinary tract issues, especially infections, can be more difficult to treat because their bodies can become resistant to continued antibiotic therapy. Environmental changes shown to lessen the recurrence of lower urinary-tract signs include: Decreasing stress in the household Increasing water intake (switching to canned food or adding water bowls/fountains to the home) Adding more litter boxes to the household Keeping litter boxes clean Potential complications of pyelonephritis are include sepsis, kidney failure , and in severe cases, death. Contact your veterinarian if your cat is showing abnormal signs or unusual behavior.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_perirenal_pseudocysts,Kidney Inflammation Due to Fluid Accumulation in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A perirenal pseudocyst is a condition in which fluid accumulates in a capsule surrounding the kidney, causing the kidney to enlarge. However, it is not technically a cyst because it lacks a true membrane covering. Perirenal pseudocysts primarily affects mature male cats (more than 8 years); if found in young cats, it commonly affects only one kidney. Although most cats with a perirenal pseudocyst have a nonpainful, enlarged abdomen, some may not display any symptoms (asymptomatic). In severe cases, symptoms of renal failure may manifest. Although the exact cause of a perirenal pseudocyst is not completely understood, kidney tumors, surgeries involving the kidney, and certain types of injuries are thought to be factors for developing the capsule. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which are normal unless severe renal insufficiency is present. Imaging studies, including X-rays and ultrasounds, may identify which kidney is affected. Additionally, a fluid sample from around the affected kidney may be taken for further evaluation. Perirenal pseudocysts are usually not life-threatening and some cats need no treatment whatsoever. Otherwise, the fluid is surgically drained from the capsule, especially when the cat's abdomen is distended. There are also forms of treatment when severe renal diseases are involved. Regular follow-up examinations (every two to six months) are required to evaulate the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of the treatment. Watch your cat for untoward symptoms, such as increased thirst ( polydipsia ), blood in urine ( hematuria ), and weight loss , and inform your veterinarian of them immediately, as they may be signs of renal failure.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_nephrolithiasis,Kidney Stones in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Cats that develop clusters of crystals or stones -- known as nephroliths or, more commonly, “kidney stones” -- in the kidneys or urinary tract are said to be suffering from a condition called nephrolithiasis. The kidney is composed of thousands of nephrons, each consisting of blood capillaries and a series of tubes through which filtered fluid flows as urine is produced. The tubes of the nephron drain into ducts through which urine flows; these ducts eventually enter the renal pelvis and a tube through which urine follows into the ureter. Kidney stones or kidney stone fragments can also pass through this system of tubes and into the ureter, causing serious complications. Both dogs and cats are susceptible to kidney stones. However, some breeds of cat are more susceptible to certain types of kidney stones than others, including the domestic shorthair and longhair, Persians, and Siamese. Many cats with kidney stones have no apparent signs; that is, the nephroliths are often not detected until diagnostic testing is done for other medical problems. Some symptoms that may occur include blood in urine ( hematuria ), vomiting, recurrent urinary tract infections, painful difficult urination ( dysuria ), and frequent urination with small volume of production ( polyuria ). Other symptoms may appear but vary depending on the location and type of the stones. Note that some nephroliths may be “inactive”; meaning, they are not infected, not progressively enlarging, and not causing obstruction or clinical signs. Inactive kidney stones may not require removal, but should be monitored periodically (via urine analysis for example) for any changes. There are a number of causes and risk factors that may contribute to the development of nephrolithiasis and the development of uroliths, such as the oversaturation of stone-forming material's in the cat's urine. Other potential causes include increased levels of calcium in the urine and blood, diets that produce high (alkaline) urine pH, and recurrent urinary tract infections. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of the cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, ultrasound imaging, and urinalysis. However, in order to confirm the diagnosis, identify the mineral content of the stones, and develop a proper course of treatment, pieces of nephroliths must be retrieved for analysis. This is usually achieved by performing a procedure known as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), in which stones are broken up within the urinary tract using sound waves. Many cats diagnosed with inactive kidney stones can be treated at home with proper medication administered in order to dissolve the stones. An adjustment to the cat's diet is also necessary. These dietary changes will be dependent on the chemical makeup of the kidney stone. In severe cases, the cat may require immediate removal of the kidney stone(s) and hospitalization. There are a number of options for kidney stone removal, including surgery or ESWL. Because kidney stones tend to recur, routine monitoring is essential. Most veterinarians recommend abdominal X-rays and/or ultrasound examinations every three to six months post initial treatment. A periodic urine analysis is also frequently recommended. If your cat is predisposed to nephrolithiasis, special foods and dietary management can be effective at preventing stone formation. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/c_ct_drug_induced_nephrotoxicity,Kidney Toxicity (Drug-Induced) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Certain medications administered for the purpose of diagnosing or treating medical disorders may cause kidney damage. When this occurs, it is referred to as drug-induced nephrotoxicity. It is more commonly recognized in dogs than cats. And although drug-induced nephrotoxicity may occur in cats of any age, older cats are more susceptible. Signs associated with nephrotoxicity may include: Nephrotoxicosis can be induced by the administration of pharmacologic agents (or drugs), which interfere with the blood flow to the kidneys as well as cause tubular dysfunction in the kidneys. If left untreated, the damage to the renal tubule cells may lead to tubular necrosis and even kidney failure. Risk factors that may increase the odds of developing drug-induced nephrotoxicity include dehydration, advanced age, and fever. When drug-induced nephrotoxicity is suspected, a veterinarian will often biopsy a portion of kidney tissue. This will help him or her identify kidney failure and also the proper course of treatment. Another useful diagnostic procedure is a urine analysis. Most cats with drug-induced nephrotoxicity will require inpatient care, especially those that are also suffering from kidney failure. In these severe cases, surgery may be required. Once the cat has returned to your home, it is important that his activity be reduced and that you provide him with a modified diet that is not excessive in protein and phosphorous. Dehydration is a common threat for cats with kidney problems; you will need to monitor him for any untoward symptoms and advise your veterinarian if they should occur, who may assist by administering fluid therapy. Electrolyte panels may be performed as frequently as every one or two days in order to evaluate the severity of azotemia, a condition commonly associated with drug-induced nephrotoxicity, in which abnormal levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as a number of body-waste compounds) are found in the blood. This is of utmost importance, as cats with severely progressed azotemia may develop acute kidney failure within days. Moreover, drug-induced nephrotoxicity may even lead to chronic kidney disease months or years later. Therefore, if any signs of illness -- such as vomiting or diarrhea -- recur, contact your veterinarian immediately. The best way to prevent this type of toxicity is to not use nephrotoxic drugs. However, if your cat requires this type of medication, administer it only under the advisement of your veterinarian. You should also consult him or her before adjusting the dosage and the possibility of adverse drug interactions. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/kitten-constipation,Kitten Constipation,"Kittens start to go to the bathroom on their own at 3-4 weeks old. Younger kittens require stimulation by their mama cat or pet parent to urinate and defecate. Don’t be concerned if your young kitten doesn’t poop with every stimulation, but as they get older, they should have a schedule of when they need to be stimulated or when they use the litter box. If your kitten is litter-trained, you may not notice that they are constipated until you realize you haven't seen any feces for a few days. Kittens that cannot defecate are uncomfortable and also at risk for serious problems if left untreated. For kittens of any age, if they go more than 24 hours without defecating, they might be constipated. Constipation is defined as difficulty defecating, and obstipation is defined as a lack of any feces being produced. Both of these conditions can occur in kittens, and both are very serious. You can try a few things at home to help, but if a kitten does not regain a normal pooping schedule within 48 hours, they should be taken to a veterinarian as soon as possible, as constipation can be life-threatening for a kitten. If constipation is left untreated, the colon will enlarge to accommodate the stool that hasn’t been passed and cause a condition called megacolon . If megacolon is left untreated and stool continues to accumulate the colon can burst, spilling feces into the abdomen, which is often fatal. Signs your kitten may be constipated include: No feces produced in 24-48 hours Straining to defecate but nothing comes out (tenesmus) Producing small, hard fecal balls With or without liquid feces—not to be confused with diarrhea Blood and/or mucus in the stool Crying in the litter box or when trying to defecate Decreased or total loss of appetite Distended abdomen, bloated appearance Restlessness Vomiting Lethargy, weakness The many causes of constipation in kittens include: Very young kittens, less than a few weeks old, are unable to defecate on their own . If the mama cat or pet parent does not stimulate the kitten or if the kitten is orphaned without anyone taking care of them, they will be unable to defecate. The feces will build up in the colon and eventually become a life-threatening condition. Dehydration is a common cause of constipation in kittens . When your kitten does not have access to a bowl of fresh water, if they eat only dry food, or during the weaning process when they are transitioned off their mother’s milk, dehydration can occur. Dehydration often causes kittens to still be able to pass small amounts of very hard stool. When young kittens transition from nursing to eating kitten food , they may not have enough fiber in the diet if they are not on a high-quality, completely balanced diet. Lack of fiber can cause constipation in young kittens. Kittens are very curious creatures and they have the tendency to eat things they should not , causing a gastrointestinal obstruction or blockage. An obstruction in the stomach or intestines often means they cannot defecate. Ribbons, string, toys, and hairballs are all common causes of obstructions that can cause obstipation (unable to defecate) in kittens. Kittens that have many intestinal worms can become constipated from the worms blocking the colon. This impaction of worms also causes an intestinal blockage that stops stool from passing. Kittens’ lack of activity or gaining too much weight can contribute to obstipation . Regular exercise and proper diet are important to avoid constipation. Neurologic conditions are more common in older cats , but some young kittens can have disease conditions that interfere with or damage the nerve control of their hind end. Nerves coming from the spinal cord control all functions of the body, including the ability to have a bowel movement. If the nerves that control the colon and the anus are damaged or nonfunctional, a kitten can get constipated from not physically being able to push the stool out of the rectum. If your kitten has not produced stool in 24-48 hours, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination, including palpating, or feeling, the abdomen. Often, since kittens and their intestinal tract are so small, the vet can feel the stool packed within the body just by placing light pressure on the belly. If your vet suspects your kitten is constipated, an x-ray of the abdomen is needed to be able to view the problem and figure out its severity. X-rays will show the large amount of stool in the colon and can also be used to find if megacolon is occurring. An ultrasound of the abdomen can also be done to view the thickness of the colon wall and figure out if it is full or empty. Whenever your kitten is having any issues related to bowel movements, it is always helpful to provide your vet with a stool sample. With significant constipation or true obstipation, with no stool being produced, your vet will understand that the stool sample was not possible. Once your veterinarian has diagnosed your kitten’s medical problem, they will provide a complete treatment plan based on the severity of the constipation. Treatment varies from outpatient medications and dietary changes to hospitalization to even surgical intervention in some cases. Making sure your cat is on a well-balanced, age appropriate, AAFCO-approved diet is important. Diets that are rich in both insoluble and soluble fiber are best for a kitten with constipation problems. Giving your kitten a fiber supplement can help to draw water back into the colon, hydrating the stool for ease of a bowel movement. Probiotics are also helpful to promote gut health. Both subcutaneous (under the skin) and intravenous (IV) fluids can help your kitten stay hydrated. Kittens that have an obstruction from intestinal parasites/worms will need to be dewormed with medication for the type of parasite found in the fecal exam. Depending on your kitten’s age and degree of constipation, they might recommend a laxative to help produce bowel movements. An oral medication, Lactulose , is a sugar-based laxative given to soften stool and to treat constipation. In cases where medications and fluids are not helpful or the degree of constipation is severe, your vet might need to give your kitten an enema. Enemas should never be tried at home and must be done by a veterinarian to avoid complications such as colon rupture. In the most severe cases of constipation and all cases of obstipation, your cat might need to have a procedure called a deobstipation. Deobstipation is when your kitten is sedated and the veterinarian can manually remove the stool from your cat’s colon. An enema is often given at the same time as deobstipation. Although it is more common in older cats, if your kitten has developed megacolon, they will likely need both surgical intervention and lifelong medications. While there are few things you can try at home to help your constipated kitten, it is always best to have them examined by your veterinarian if you think they are having any medical issues such as constipation. If your cat is obstipated and no stool is coming out, then they do need to see a veterinarian as soon as possible—that is a medical emergency. If you have a very young kitten, under 4 weeks old, stimulating them often with a soft cotton material around their anus will help to produce a bowel movement. Be sure your kitten is well-hydrated by giving them free access to fresh water, feeding them canned kitten food, and adding water to the food. This can all be helpful to avoid constipation. Keeping your kitten active and moving to stimulate bowel movements can also be helpful. Bicycle the legs, gently massage the belly, and encourage walking to get things moving to try and help produce a bowel movement. A soak in a warm water bath can also be helpful to relax their muscles while you massage their belly. Be careful not to massage or put too much pressure on your kitten’s belly as the intestines are delicate. You want to avoid any internal injury. Once the hard stool or obstruction is removed, recovery from kitten constipation is quick. The most important step is to figure out the underlying cause so that it doesn’t happen again. Follow the instructions your veterinarian provided, and finishing medications as prescribed is another key to recovery. Most often, the diet changes and medications will be given longterm to prevent your kitten from getting constipated again. Even if your kitten is feeling better and back to their normal self, it’s important to never stop treatment without the approval of your kitten’s veterinarian. Kittens must also have routine deworming and fecal checks to keep them parasite-free. Some types of worms are even treated and prevented with monthly flea and tick prevention products such as Revolution® . Featured Image: iStock.com/aldomurillo Cornell Feline Health Center.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_ileus,Lack of Intestinal Motility in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The term ileus (functional or paralytic) is used to denote temporary and reversible blockages in the intestines due to the absence of bowel motility. This absence of normal intestinal movements (or peristalsis) results in accumulation of intestinal contents in certain areas of intestine. It should be remembered that ileus itself is not a primary disease in cats, but a complication seen due to some other disease or condition affecting normal motility of the intestines. After recording a detailed history and performing a complete physical examination, routine laboratory tests will be conducted. These tests include complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The main objective of the diagnostic effort is to find the underlying cause of this problem. Results of routine laboratory testing may reveal some information related to the underlying disease. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasound will help in finding various abnormalities including: presence of gas, fluid, mechanical obstruction (e.g., foreign body), tumor in abdomen, and other such conditions. For confirmation, your veterinarian may use more specific testing like Barium-Impregnated Polyethylene Spheres (BIPS). Barium is a chemical used in certain radiological studies to enhance visualization of anatomical structures. BIPS are markers given orally and will demonstrate the extent of intestinal obstruction and motility disorder. Your veterinarian will assess the time it takes for these markers to move along the intestines and how much delay is involved. This test also helps in the localization of the anatomical site involved. Endoscopy is also an option for diagnosis, especially for an assessment of mechanical obstruction. Your veterinarian will look directly into the stomach and intestine using an instrument called an endoscope. A rigid or flexible tube will be inserted into your cat’s stomach, where your veterinarian will be able to visually inspect and take pictures. In some cases, exploratory surgery may need to be performed to rule out mechanical obstruction. X-ray, computed tomography scan, magnetic imaging test, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (fluid circulate around brain and spinal cord) may be required in patients in whom spinal cord injury is suspected. As ileus is the result of some other underlying disease, treating the underlying cause is of utmost importance for resolution of this problem. For example, your veterinarian will use fluid therapy to address fluid and electrolyte derangements, which is common in cats with ileus. In some cats, drugs to enhance intestinal motility are also given to stimulate intestinal movements. During treatment, your veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to the abdomen in order to find the status gut sounds and motility. If the primary underlying cause is identified and corrected, the prognosis is excellent in affected animals. But determining the exact underlying cause may be difficult in some animals. Follow directions given by your veterinarian regarding care and nutrition of your cat, and call your veterinarian immediately if you see any untoward symptom in your cat. In patients with a history of infections, regular temperature monitoring may be required at home. If medicines are prescribed for your cat, strictly follow the exact frequency and dosage of each drug. In addition, do not stop or alter treatment prior to consulting with your veterinarian.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_lactic_acidosis,Lactic Acid Build-Up in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Lactic acidosis refers to the abnormal build-up of lactic acid in the body. When this abnormal build-up occurs, it affects the heart (cardiac system), and eventually all of the organ systems in the body. Lactic acid is a substance that is produced by the muscles during normal physical activity, and which is elevated during exercise. In a normal functioning body, the liver and the kidneys work to maintain the balance between lactic acid production and its removal. When lactic acid is not being adequately removed, the body becomes ill. The recommended treatment for lactic acidosis will be dependent upon the underlying medical condition that is causing the lactic acid to build up. Common symptoms can include heavy breathing, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Persistent lactic acid build-up in the body will affect heart function and output, and can have a severe impact on organ function. Most signs of lactic acidosis are related to the underlying cause of the medical condition and not the actual condition. One of the primary causes of lactic acidosis is an insufficient amount of oxygen in the blood or poor use of oxygen by the body. Young cats are at a higher risk for developing the condition and they are also more likely to go into traumatic shock as a result of acquiring it. Older animals are more likely to develop kidney (renal) failure, heart failure, liver disease, cancer, anemia, or vascular disorders. Your veterinarian's primary objective is to determine what the cause is for the lactic acid build-up in the body. A series of blood tests will be carried out in order to pinpoint the cause of the condition, as well as to determine what the appropriate treatment will be. Lactic acidosis is often severe by the time it is diagnosed and will require aggressive therapy to bring it under control. Prescribed treatment by your veterinarian will be dependent upon the underlying cause. The ability of your cat's body's to clear lactate (salt of lactic acid) will be a good indicator of the therapy's success, and can determine whether your cat will survive. It is important to observe your cat's ongoing response to the given treatment so that the chances for a healthy recovery are increased. Some of the potential complications of lactic acidosis include multiple organ failure and a heightened mortality rate. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_laryngeal_disease,Laryngeal Disease in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The voice box, or larynx, serves as a passage for airflow from the external environment to the lungs. It protects the lungs from aspiration during swallowing and regurgitation, and allows for vocalization (such as meowing). Laryngeal disease refers to any condition that alters normal structure and/or function of the voice box or larynx. In cats, the incidence of laryngeal disease is based on limited reports in the literature, but it appears to be significantly lower than in dogs. Affected cats are usually older, but it is seen occasionally in younger cats secondary to trauma or surgical procedures; the average age in one report was 11 years of age. Cancer of the larynx or voice box generally occurs in middle-aged to older cats. There is no defined breed susceptibility. Symptoms are directly related to the degree of impairment or restriction of airflow through the voice box or larynx, though acquired paralysis is often associated with exertion, stress, or extreme heat. Some common signs of laryngeal disease include: Laryngeal disease may be congenital (present at birth) or acquired, most often due an unknown cause. The following are some of the more common causes of laryngeal diseases: Risk factors include existing lung abnormalities, such as pneumonia and chronic airway disease. Fluid build-up in the space between the chest wall and the lungs (pleural effusion) can also have a significant impact on breathing and may increase the breathing difficulties associated with diseases of the voice box or larynx. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. One of the possible underlying causes your doctor will be looking for is thyroid disease, particularly if your cat is older. Some of the diagnostic imaging techniques that may be used to find the underlying disorder are X-ray, fluoroscopy, and bronchoscopy to help rule out other differential diagnoses and to detect aspiration pneumonia. These are all fairly non-invasive techniques, as they do not require surgery to inspect the internal structure of the airways. Ultrasound is also a useful diagnostic tool in the non-invasive diagnosis of laryngeal masses. To get an even closer look at the larynx, your doctor may conduct a laryngoscopy. Your cat will need to be placed under heavy sedation or anesthesia in order for your veterinarian to evaluate laryngeal abduction on inspiration and to detect whether mass lesions are present. Laryngeal collapse is a complication of long-standing brachycephalic airway syndrome. Chronic proliferative, pyogranulomatous (granular and pussy) laryngitis will require culture and microscopic examination to define; broad spectrum antibiotics, given beforehand, along with tapered administration of corticosteroids, may be required to obtain an optimal response. Conditions that cause obstruction, such as tracheal collapse or masses close to the larynx, may mimic laryngeal disease. If a mass lesion is found during examination, it may require surgical removal. Diagnosis of paralysis can be confirmed by a loss of abduction (a change in the position) of the laryngeal cartilages during deep inspiration. Paralysis on only one side may be noted in earlier or milder forms of laryngeal dysfunction. Your cat will be treated as an outpatient while awaiting surgery, as long as its health remains stable. If it is an emergency situation characterized by marked breathing distress, oxygen therapy, combined with sedation and steroids, will be administered. If your cat is in distress, the staff at the animal clinic can employ active body-cooling measures with intravenous fluids and ice, and your veterinarian can create a temporary surgical opening into the windpipe (or trachea – a procedure known as a temporary tracheostomy) to make oxygen intake easier. This care may prove life-saving if your cat is not responding appropriately to the emergency medical approach. If you are providing your cat with temporary care at home while awaiting surgery, you will need to avoid warm, poorly ventilated environments, as these can further compromise the body's normal cooling mechanisms and proper air exchange. Avoid the use of collars during this time as well, in order to minimize pressure on the voice box or windpipe. You will also want to restrict activity pending surgery, or if you have opted out of surgery. In the case of paralysis, surgical management is the treatment of choice. A variety of procedures have been reported, but correction on one-side only is preferred. The benefit of this procedure will depend on the surgeon's experience and expertise. In case of trauma to the trachea, a temporary surgical opening into the windpipe (temporary tracheostomy) may be life-saving and curative. A permanent surgical opening into the windpipe (permanent tracheostomy) may improve quality of life. If cancer has been diagnosed, surgical removal of the tumor may be curative. For squamous-cell adenocarcinoma, surgical removal, coupled with radiation therapy, is the management of choice. Prescribed medications will depend on the final diagnosis and long-term course of treatment that is prescribed by your doctor. Your veterinarian will want to monitor your cat frequently for aspiration pneumonia, as this is one of the major life-threatening risks of Laryngeal disease. There is an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia after any surgical procedure involving the voice box or larynx, as surgery places the larynx in a “fixed-open position,” eliminating its protective function during swallowing or regurgitation. There is an increased risk of aspiration, overall, particularly if evidence of aspiration was noted before surgical treatment of paralysis, and when swallowing disorders were found to be present as well. Generally, improvements in activity and exercise tolerance are reported by owners after effective surgery. The long-term prognosis is good to excellent with successful surgery for paralysis. If the initial surgery was unsatisfactory, additional surgery may improve the prognosis. For the treatment of trauma, progress is usually satisfactory with conservative management, even after an emergency tracheostomy. The prognosis is more often than not poor in the treatment of cancers such as squamous-cell adenocarcinoma, even with radiation therapy. For cancers such as lymphomas, the prognosis depends on the chemotherapy that is used and patient response. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/mouth/laryngeal-paralysis-cats,Laryngeal Paralysis in Cats,"Laryngeal paralysis is an upper-airway disorder where the cartilages of the larynx do not open and close normally. The larynx, or voice box, is the opening to the trachea (windpipe) that allows your cat to meow, but also acts as a gatekeeper between the mouth and the lungs. When the cat inhales, muscles pull the larynx open from two sides and then they relax when the cat exhales. In cats with laryngeal paralysis, these muscles do not function properly, so when the cat inhales, the airway does not pull open, creating an airway obstruction. Laryngeal paralysis in cats is a medical emergency because if left untreated, airway obstruction can quickly progress to suffocation and death. If suspect laryngeal paralysis in your cat, contact your nearest animal hospital immediately. Early symptoms can be subtle and difficult to identify, but may include: As the disease progresses, a cat will have a hard time breathing (panting, expanding chest and weakness) especially during physical activity. This eventually can lead to collapse, suffocation and death. The progression can take months, or even years. Secondary symptoms may include: The following are possible causes of laryngeal paralysis in cats. While obesity in cats will not directly cause laryngeal paralysis, it is known to make the disorder much worse. If your cat has any evidence of respiratory distress or trouble breathing, immediately seek veterinary attention. The vet will perform a thorough physical examination, including listening to your cat’s heart and lungs. A tentative diagnosis of laryngeal paralysis may be made based on physical examination and the presence of inspiratory stridor (a high-pitched vibrating noise when your cat is breathing in and out). Definitive diagnosis will require a procedure called laryngoscopy , which involves sedating the cat and visualizing the larynx with either a laryngoscope or an endoscope to confirm whether the larynx is opening properly during inspiration. Neck and chest X-rays will likely be performed to look for signs of a mass or tumor, as well as to rule out aspiration pneumonia. A full bloodwork panel will be performed to determine complete blood count and serum chemistry, as well as the cat’s thyroid level. Initially, in mild cases, supportive care such as steroids or sedatives/tranquilizers may be used to help keep the inflammation and swelling down and help the cat to relax and improve overall breathing. However, as the disease progresses, these treatment options will be insufficient and the cat may experience respiratory distress. Any cat with respiratory distress, or trouble breathing, should be immediately evaluated by a veterinarian. Often, these cats will require sedation, oxygen supplementation and intubation in the short term to allow them to breathe and stabilize. Additional supportive care may include cooling - if the cat has overheated - or IV fluids if the cat has become dehydrated. Once your cat is stable, surgery is often necessary to open the larynx and restore normal breathing. The surgical procedure is called a unilateral arytenoid lateralization or tieback and involves using a suture to permanently open (or tie back) one side of the larynx so that air can more freely flow into the lungs. This removes the airway obstruction and allows your cat to breathe much easier. Most cats will need to remain hospitalized for one to two days after surgery and remain on IV fluids and pain medication. Cats are typically discharged once they resume eating and if no vomiting or respiratory distress occurs. The recovery time at home includes 10 to 14 days of rest and restricted activity, but after that, your cat can typically be released to normal activity. The biggest risk in the post-operative period is aspiration. Since the airway has been “tied” open, the pet is at risk to breathe in food or vomit, resulting in aspiration pneumonia. Signs of aspiration pneumonia include the following: Unlike with laryngeal paralysis, you most likely will not hear noisy breathing. Aspiration pneumonia can become deadly and requires antibiotics and sometimes hospitalization for IV fluids and oxygen support, so it is important to monitor your cat carefully after surgery. Initially, laryngeal paralysis can often be successfully medically managed with steroids and sedatives/tranquilizers. However, over time, the disease will typically progress to respiratory distress. At this point, surgery is often needed for survival. Laryngeal paralysis is treatable but often requires surgery. With surgery, most cats can go on to live normal lives. The most common symptoms of laryngeal paralysis in cats are noisy breathing, raspy meow/voice change, and cough.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_carnitine,L-Carnitine Deficiency in Cats,"PetMD Editorial L-carnitine is an important nutrient that acts as a transport for fatty acids, essential for the cellular production of energy. Deficiency of this nutrient can cause a variety of health problems for a cat; most significantly, the association with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a disease of the heart. The heart and skeletal muscles do not synthesize the carnitine nutrient on their own, requiring it to be transported there for use. Therefore, a deficiency of carnitine in the body will have a negative effect on the heart and skeletal muscles. While carnitine supplements are not always successful at reversing the effects of this deficiency, they have proven to be the most successful course of treatment. Signs of this deficiency may include: L-carnitine is important for muscle tissue to receive energy and function normally. A deficiency in this nutrient, therefore, can create a negative impact throughout the cat's body. This disease is still being studied, but there is some evidence that suggests that certain breeds may be at increased risk of acquiring this disorder. In order to diagnose this deficiency, heart (endomyocardial) muscle biopsies must be performed in order to measure carnitine levels. Your cat's size and weight will determine the proper dosage of L-carnitine supplements. Keep in mind that many cats will not show an improvement in health. In addition, some cats may even show an increase in diarrhea as the carnitine dosage in their diet is increased. An appropriately prescribed diet, with plenty of fluids, will be essential for preventing complications during this period. Once carnitine treatment has begun, it is recommended that you continue regular veterinary check-ups with your cat. Your doctor will perform an echocardiogram (or EKG) every three to six months to ensure that treatment has been effective. There are no known methods of prevention, other than maintaining a healthy diet for your cat. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia,Leukemia (Acute) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a disease in which cancerous lymphoblasts (cells that are in the beginning stage of development) and prolymphocytes (cells in the intermediate stage of development) reproduce, and then circulate through the bloodstream, entering into the body's organs. These cells will also infiltrate both the inside of the bone marrow and the outside (extramedullary) of the bone marrow, displacing hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic cells are the normal, healthy precursors of red blood cells, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells. Cats with this disease will acquire impaired immunity, and will be inclined to contracting infections. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health and onset of symptoms. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background medical history, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. If cancer is suspected, your doctor will also need to take bone marrow biopsies (samples) for a microscopic (cytologic) examination of the cells. If malignant cancer cells are present, the examination will show lymphoblastic infiltration of the bone marrow. Abdominal x-rays may also be taken to check for an enlarged liver and/or an enlarged spleen. Animals can normally be treated on an outpatient basis. However, if your cat has low levels of red blood cells, platelets (the cells responsible for clotting), or other blood clotting factors, your cat should be hospitalized and given blood transfusions to prevent excessive bleeding. If your cat has been diagnosed with leukemia, your veterinarian will also prescribe a chemotherapeutic medicine to halt the growth of malignant cells. You will need to wear gloves when you give this medication to your cat. If your cat is diagnosed with leukemia, you will need to keep it isolated from other animals. Your cat’s system will lack an immune response (immunocompromised) as a result of both the cancer and the therapy. In the process of destroying fast growing cancerous cells, chemotherapy will also destroy white blood cells responsible for fighting invasion, making your cat prone to infection. Even a simple cold can quickly become a fatal case of pneumonia. Red blood cells can also be affected; one possible side affect of a low red blood cell count is anemia. And blood platelets, the cells responsible for coagulation (clotting), can be affected as well. A low platelet count can result in bruising and excessive bleeding. Animals suffering from this disorder are prone to hemorrhage from lack of platelets. Your veterinarian will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your cat’s peripheral blood count and bone marrow status. Unfortunately, the prognosis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is grave.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_chronic_lymphocytic_leukemia,Leukemia (Chronic) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Animals with abnormal and malignant lymphocytes in the blood are said to have a rare form of cancer called chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An integral component to the immune system, lymphocytes can affect many body systems when damaged. Although rare, this form of leukemia affects both dogs and cats. The symptoms for chronic lymphocytic leukemia are usually non-specific and may include: The following are suspected but unproven risk factors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). Blood testing may reveal anemia, abnormally low number of platelets (cells involved in blood clotting), and abnormal increase in number of lymphocytes in blood film observed under microscope. Your pet’s veterinarian will also conduct a bone marrow biopsy, which will provide a more detailed picture into the abnormalities in lymphocyte production. If the cat is displaying no symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend against treatment. Otherwise, chemotherapy remains the most popular form of treatment. A veterinary oncologist will be able to devise a treatment plan based on the cat and stage of the disease. In some patients, the spleen may need to be removed to avoid complications. Regular monitoring and checkups are necessary to evaluate the cat's response to treatment and the progression of the disease. Moreover, regular blood, cardiac, and body system testing will be required if the cat is undergoing chemotherapy. This is because cats are more prone to infection when taking chemotherapeutic drugs. In case of serious complications, your veterinarian may reduce dosages or stop the treatment altogether. Should you be required to administer the drugs, your veterinarian will instruct you as to the dosage and frequency. Do not ever increase or reduce the dosage of drugs without prior consulting with your veterinarian. These chemotherapeutic agents are just as toxic to humans, and should only be administered under strict guidelines. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin-hair/c_ct_lice_feline_pediculosis,Lice in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Lice are parasites that live on the skin. Left unchecked, they can grow to be an infestation on the cat’s body. Lice are actually very small insects that feed by chewing on the skin of the animal they are infesting, in this case, the cat. They are not as common as fleas; they are most often seen in situations where sanitary practices are poor. Symptoms seen in infested cats include: There is only one species of lice that infests cats: Felicola subrostrata. Lice can be passed directly from one cat to another through direct contact or through contact with contaminated objects, such as grooming utensils or bedding. Lice are species-specific. They do not move from one species to another. That means that you cannot get lice from your cat nor can your cat get human specific lice from you. Diagnosis is easily made by visually observing lice or their nits (eggs) in the hair. Adult lice are flat, six-legged insects with no wings. Nits can be seen attached to the individual hair shafts and appear as small white dots. There are a wide variety of shampoos, as well as insecticidal sprays and powders that are effective in killing lice. In addition, products such as fipronil and selamectin can also be used. (They come in various brand names.) It may be necessary to treat your cat more than once to kill the developing nits as they hatch. Follow your veterinarian’s directions closely, as these products can be harsh on some cats. In cases where your cat’s fur is badly matted, it may be necessary to shave the fur to be sure of getting to the deeper lice and their nits. To prevent reinfection, dispose of or wash all of your cat’s bedding, as well as thoroughly cleaning all of the places your cat spends time. Some items that cannot be laundered or washed down may be sealed tightly in plastic bags for a few weeks. Disinfect all grooming utensils and anything else your cat comes into contact with regularly, such as litter boxes and crates, and of course, all of the furniture, rugs, carpeting and hard flooring.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_cancer_spleen_liver,Liver and Spleen Cancer (Hemangiosarcoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hemangiosarcomas are fed by the blood vessels and fill with blood. Because of this, the tumor can rupture, leading to sudden and severe hemorrhage, collapse, and rapid death. Often, owners do not realize their cat is affected until the sudden hemorrhage or collapse. Hemangiosarcomas of the spleen and liver are highly metastatic and malignant vascular neoplasms (blood vessel tumors) that arise from the endothelial cells, which line the interior surface of blood vessels. It begins as a large mass that develops in the liver or spleen, spreading rapidly through the blood cell routes, most frequently to the liver from the spleen, or to the lungs from the spleen and liver. In some cases, it can also metastasize to the brain or heart. It can also lead to growth of implantation lesions in the omentum, an apron type fold in the abdominal wall. This type of cancer is relatively rare in cats, as opposed to dogs . Often, just as with dogs, the cancer goes undetected and the cause of death is not known until a necropsy is performed. In cats, hemangiosarcomas were found in 18 cats out of 3,145 necropsies, with the liver the most common site to be affected. The average age of occurrence is ten years, and in cats, the domestic shorthair appears to be more disposed to hemangiosarcomas. Symptoms are generally related to the organs involved; that is, a tumor of the spleen will result in impaired spleen function, and a tumor of the liver will result in impaired liver function. Other common symptoms include: Cause is unknown. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat's health leading up to the onset of symptoms, and as much detail as you can about the symptoms you have observed. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. Findings can include anemia or a low blood platelet count. Diagnostic imaging is one of the best methods for viewing the abdominal cavity and making an initial diagnosis. X-rays may reveal one or more abdominal masses, along with possible evidence of abdominal fluid. Thoracic radiography of the chest cavity can detect metastasis into the lungs. Ultrasonography can be used to reveals masses in the spleen and any liver involvement. Echocardiography may be performed in patients with evidence of fluid around the heart and may detect cardiac masses. Your doctor may also be able to use ultrasound to guide a fine needle to the tumor in order to take a tissue and fluid biopsy. An analysis of tissue taken directly from the tumor is the most conclusive method for making a diagnosis. This type of tumor necessitates inpatient care. Intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and transfusions of fresh whole blood for patients with severe anemia will be part of the initial medical care. Coagulation will also be managed as necessary. Depending on the stage of metastasis, surgical management may also be employed. If possible, the tumor will be removed along with the surrounding tissue or the entire organ, A successful splenectomy may give your cat an additional three months of life. If chemotherapy can be successfully employed along with surgery, survival time may be lengthened but not considerably. Because of the aggressive and malignant nature of this tumor, survival time is generally short. Your cat's activity will need to be restricted until after initial surgical management period is over. Your veterinarian will advise you on the level of activity you should encourage in your cat. It is important to take care in physical activity and to follow your doctor's instructions, since spontaneous hemorrhage may occur. After surgery, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication. Chest and abdominal radiography and abdominal ultrasound are needed every three months after the initial treatment to monitor for recurrence.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cancer/c_ct_liver_cancer,Liver Cancer (Hepatocellular Carcinoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hepatocellular carcinoma describes a rare but malignant tumor of the epithelial tissues of the liver (the tissue that lines the cavities and surfaces of body structures – in this case the liver). This type of tumor is rare in cats – cats are more commonly affected by bile duct carcinoma. There are no breed predispositions, but affected cats are on average older than ten years of age. The following symptoms are typically absent until the disease reaches an advanced stage: Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, including a complete blood profile, chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. A microscopic study of fluid taken from the liver by needle will be done to detect dysplasia (a pre-cancerous change in cells and tissues) and overt malignant features of cancerous cell spread. Occasionally, the only finding of the study is necrotic (dead) cells in the liver. A hepatic biopsy will need to be conducted in order to make a conclusive diagnosis. This will require that your veterinarian surgically remove a sample of liver tissue for laboratory analysis. A needle biopsy is not recommended. Diagnostic imaging may include abdominal radiography to localize the tumor, and X-ray imaging of the chest to check for metastasis into the lungs. Treatment will be given on an outpatient basis, unless surgical intervention requires postoperative critical care during recuperation, or bleeding tumors require transfusion of blood components or whole blood transfusions. Your veterinarian may consult a veterinary oncologist for assistance. Surgical removal of the tumor is recommended when possible, and is often most successful when the tumor is massive and singularly located. Up to 75 percent of the liver can be surgically removed without pronounced loss of function. However, nodular and scattered (diffuse) forms are often not good candidates for surgery. Chemotherapy is not recommended, as it has not been found to be successful in the treatment of liver cancer. Your veterinarian will schedule follow up exams for abdominal palpation and to evaluate for recurrence every two to four months. Abdominal ultrasonographies will be repeated every two to four months for the first year, and liver enzymes will be checked. Unfortunately, this is often a malignant cancer, and the prognosis is poor. Even without metastasis, survival after surgery is generally less than three months. However, the final prognosis will depend on the degree of tumor invasion, how much of the tumor could be successfully removed, and whether it has spread into the body.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/liver-disease-cats,Liver Disease in Cats,"The liver is an extremely important organ, situated behind the diaphragm and near the stomach, pancreas, and spleen. It has multiple roles, including: Protein synthesis Production of clotting factors and bile, which aids in digestion of foods Detoxification of wastes and toxins, as well as the metabolism of drugs Storage of vitamins and minerals Immunologic functions Because of its diverse role, the liver is susceptible to damage from a variety of sources, and, if affected, significant problems can occur. Inflammation results, known as hepatitis, which progresses to death of liver cells, loss of function, and eventual liver failure. Fortunately, the prognosis can be good if caught early enough and treated appropriately. Usually, unless in the end stages or caused by a more severe form of liver disease, most symptoms cats experience include: Lethargy Vomiting Diarrhea Inappetence Weight loss Unusual bruising and/or bleeding Increase in thirst and urination Jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, or gums), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen), or symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy and behavior changes like circling and head pressing, seizures, and coma are also noted with liver disease. Liver disease in cats has numerous causes, which often makes determining the source frustrating for veterinarians. The vet will need to consider your cat’s age, lifestyle, and environment to help narrow the cause of liver disease. For instance, obese cats are more prone to hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease); couple that with a period of stress (e.g., boarding) and you have the perfect environment for this disease to occur. Hepatic lipidosis occurs when excessive fat is broken down rapidly, which overwhelms the liver’s ability to process it. It then becomes stored in the liver, affecting liver function. When left unchecked, it can lead to jaundice and death. Other causes of liver disease include: Bacterial infections Viral infections Fungal infections Parasitic infections Inflammatory conditions (cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis) Toxins (e.g., Tylenol, blue-green algae, sago palms) Portosystemic shunts (PSS)—usually a congenital issue that often impairs the liver’s ability to detoxify wastes The liver can also become secondarily affected by endocrine disorders such as Diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism and conditions affecting the gallbladder such as bile duct obstruction and cholecystitis (inflammation) or even rupture. Cancers can also occur in the liver, as can hepatic amyloidosis—seen primarily in Persians and Abyssinians—which is an inherited condition that causes abnormal protein deposits in the liver. In addition to a physical exam and screening tests such as bloodwork and urinalysis, other blood tests may be recommended depending on the cat. To provide an accurate diagnosis, a liver sample may be needed. This is often accomplished through surgery or a biopsy, where a needle is inserted directly into the liver. Liver disease in cats can be curable, depending on the underlying cause. Medications and diet are often the main treatments recommended. Because the liver is responsible for many functions related to digestion and metabolism of nutrients, a diet that requires less work from the liver can be helpful. Prescription diets such as Hill’s l/d or Purina® Pro Plan® HP Hepatic are formulated to have more digestible protein, contain more antioxidants, and have lower amounts of certain minerals like copper, which can be harmful to the liver. Your veterinarian will be able to determine the appropriate diet for your cat. Medications such as SAMe , acetylcysteine, vitamin supplements, and ursodiol are often used to treat liver disease. Supportive care such as IV fluids, pain control, antacids, and anti-nausea medications—and even a feeding tube—might be recommended to slow disease progression and allow the liver to regenerate. In extreme cases, plasma transfusions may be necessary, and chemotherapy and/or surgery might be pursued where applicable. The liver has a unique ability to regenerate. And for some diseases, if caught early and treated aggressively, cats can have a good prognosis and go on to live a normal life. Unfortunately, for some cats where the disease is excessive or prognosis poor, humane euthanasia may be recommended.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_arteriovenous_malformation_liver,Liver Fistula in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Intrahepatic arteriovenous (AV) fistula is generally a congenital based condition, which causes abnormal passages to develop between the proper liver (hepatic) arteries and the inner liver (intrahepatic) portal veins. It can also develop through surgical injury, trauma, and abnormal tissue or bone growth (neoplasia). Although this condition is uncommon in cats, it does occur. This severe illness can be addressed with fair results when a proper diagnosis has been settled on. Most treatment will be on an outpatient basis and will include a planned diet, dietary restrictions, and long term observation. Cats suffering from AV fistula may show lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, excessive thirst (polydipsia), dementia, and abdominal swelling. There are several other signs of AV fistula, such as: The central nervous system may also be affected by this condition. Symptoms can include: There is no particular breed that shows a higher predisposition than another. Hepatic AV is a vascular (vessel) malformation that is genetically determined during the embryonic stage of development - also referred to as embryologic anlage. Most conditions begin to show at an early age. In some cases of AV, surgical injury, trauma, or tumor growth (neoplasia) can lead to the problem. The disorder can be tested for by conducting a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry, and urinalysis techniques, as well as coagulation tests, abdominal (peritoneal) fluid analysis, and an evaluation of bile acids (digestive secretion from the liver). X-rays, ultrasounds, liver biopsies, and explaratory laparotomies (incision into the abdominal wall) are other exams that may help to diagnose the liver malformation. While some cats will require surgical care, most can be treated at home with proper nursing care. Modifications to the diet will often include dietary restrictions on nitrogen and sodium. Hydration and electrolyte disturbances will also be addressed and treated. Drugs that rely on liver biotransformation should be avoided, along with any drugs that will react with GABA-benzodiazepine receptors (the transmitters that inhibit anxiety and over excitement). Veterinarians commonly prescribe histamines for blood pressure reduction, and diuretics (furosemides) to relieve excess fluid. It will be important for your veterinarian to monitor your cat's biochemistry every few weeks, and then every few months following the initial treatment routines. Prognosis is fair when AV is properly treated, although your cat will require ongoing monitoring and treatment to address any related health issues that may arise. As the health issue is mostly congenital in nature, there are no preventative measures to consider. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/liver-flukes-cats-symptoms-causes-and-treatment,"Liver Flukes in Cats: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment","Baramyou0708/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Liver flukes are trematode parasites that infect many types of animals, including cats. While several types of liver flukes exist, Platynosomum concinnum is the most common one affecting cats. It’s mostly found in hot, humid climates. Between 15% and 85% of cats living in geographic areas where liver flukes are most common—such as Florida or Hawaii—will become infected. Cats get liver flukes after they eat another infected animal, such as a lizard. Liver flukes move to the cat’s liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, where they cause significant damage and inflammation (swelling). Cats allowed outdoors are more commonly diagnosed with liver flukes because they hunt and eat infected animals. Many cats with liver flukes are asymptomatic, while others show concerning symptoms, such as jaundice , vomiting , and weight loss . If a cat shows any of these signs, they should be brought to a veterinarian right away for the right diagnosis and treatment. With treatment, a cat’s outlook is generally good, and most cats recover fully from liver fluke infections. However, if left untreated, liver flukes can make cats very ill and may cause liver failure or death. Many cats can control liver fluke infections and therefore have no symptoms. However, when larger numbers of liver flukes are present, symptoms are more common. Because of the longer life cycle of liver flukes, symptoms generally start between two and four months after infection and may include the following: Decreased appetite Lethargy Fever Jaundice Vomiting Diarrhea Distended (enlarged) abdomen Weight loss Liver flukes have an indirect life cycle, which means they need intermediate hosts to survive and infect cats. First, liver fluke eggs (found in animal stool) are eaten by a snail and turn into sporocysts in the snail’s body. These sporocysts are released by the snail and eaten by other host animals, such as lizards and frogs, thereby infecting them. Cats then become infected with liver flukes when they hunt and eat an infected host, such as a frog. After they are eaten, liver flukes leave the cat’s intestines and travel to the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, where they grow and reproduce. The eggs they make are later shed in the cat’s stool. Because of the liver fluke’s complex life cycle, it takes about three months for cats to shed liver fluke eggs. Once the eggs are shed, they can be eaten again by snails, and the life cycle restarts. Diagnosis can be difficult, so veterinarians use a combination of tests to confirm liver flukes in cats. First, a veterinarian will start with a physical exam to find any obvious abnormalities, such as a distended belly or jaundice. A veterinarian will also ask specific questions, such as when symptoms started and if your cat spends any time outdoors. Diagnostic tests are helpful to figure out the underlying cause of the cat’s symptoms and may include the following: Fecal sedimentation : A small sample of feces is combined with water, which allows liver fluke eggs to settle at the bottom so they can be seen under a microscope. Eggs are shed off and on, so this test has the potential for false negatives. Blood work : A small sample of blood is used to check red and white blood cells, platelets, and internal organ function, including the liver. Abdominal ultrasound : Ultrasound is a special test using sound waves is used to look at the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts to find damage caused by liver flukes. Liver biopsy : A sample is taken from the liver to see changes, such as inflammation or fibrosis, related to liver fluke infections. This test requires general anesthesia and surgery to collect a sample; therefore, it may not be recommended in all patients, such as those that are critically ill or with other health issues. Treatment for liver flukes in cats includes anti-parasitic medications, such as praziquantel or fenbendazole . Getting rid of all the liver flukes may take several courses of treatment. Other medications that may be prescribed include the following: Corticosteroids , such as prednisolone , to reduce inflammation Antibiotics , such as amoxicillin , to prevent secondary bacterial infections Anti-nausea medications , such as maropitant , to reduce nausea and vomiting Bile acids , such as ursodiol , to increase bile flow through the bile ducts Antioxidants , such as vitamin E, to protect the liver Supplements , such as SAMe , to promote liver health In severe infections, cats may be very ill and need hospitalization and supportive care. Treatment that may be given includes intravenous (IV) fluid therapy, medication, and feeding support, such as a feeding tube or special diet. Cats with several liver flukes may have occluded (blocked) bile ducts and may need surgery to fix the problem. With the right treatment, most cats fully recover after mild infections. However, in chronic or severe cases that have been left untreated, the condition can be fatal. Even after treatment, it can take two months for cats to stop shedding liver fluke eggs. Because eggs continue to be shed, re-infection is a concern if a cat is exposed to the same environment he was in before getting infected. Pet parents should keep their cat indoors and give all medications exactly as prescribed during the treatment period. They should also ensure their cat attends any follow-up appointments to confirm the infection has been cleared up. Liver fluke infections can also increase the risk of liver or pancreatic carcinomas in cats due to damage and inflammation from chronic infections. Your veterinarian may recommend keeping an eye on the liver, gall bladder, and bile ducts. Because liver flukes are picked up by cats when they hunt and eat other small animals, keeping your cat indoors will prevent them from becoming infected. Keep your cat on monthly parasite protection with products containing praziquantel , such as NexGard® COMBO . A snail eats liver fluke eggs that are found in animal feces. Those eggs develop into sporocysts in the snail’s body, are released into the environment, and are later eaten by animals. If a cat eats an infected frog, for example, the liver fluke will move out of the cat’s intestines and into the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts, where they mature and reproduce. After two to three months, liver fluke eggs are shed in a cat’s stool and the cycle repeats. Although certain species of liver flukes can infect humans, cats don’t pass liver flukes directly to their pet parents. Center S. Hepatobiliary Fluke Infection in Small Animals .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/liver-inflammation-hepatitis-cats,Liver Inflammation (Hepatitis) in Cats,"Liver inflammation in cats can be confusing for pet parents, mostly because there are different terms thrown around when discussing this condition. The reason there are so many terms centers around the fact that more than the liver is involved. Inflammation of the liver is also known as hepatitis, and it is much more common in dogs than in cats. Cats more commonly get inflammation of the liver, the gallbladder, and the bile ducts at the same time, a condition called cholangiohepatitis. Alternatively, they get inflammation of the bile ducts by themselves, known as cholangitis. Because these diseases of the liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts are so similar in how they affect cats, they are often grouped together and called cholangitis-cholangiohepatitis syndrome, or CCHS for short. The liver has a lot of important jobs in the cat's body, from eliminating toxins to synthesizing proteins. One of the many important roles the liver plays is bile production. Bile is necessary for the digestion of food. It is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is nestled in between the lobes of a cat’s liver. Bile is transported from the gallbladder out the bile ducts into the intestine where it helps to break down fats. When the ducts become inflamed, bile is not able to be properly transported into the intestine. This leads to poor digestion of fats and decreased function of the liver. When CCHS occurs and the liver, gallbladder, or bile duct become inflamed, chronic vomiting and anorexia often occur. Prolonged anorexia can be dangerous for a cat, and if left untreated, CCHS can lead to another liver disease called hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver syndrome. If your cat is not eating, it’s important to get them to your veterinarian right away for diagnostics and prompt treatment. CCHS is often the result of an underlying issue in cats, such as an infection or an overly sensitive immune system that is more prone to inflammation. Gallbladder stones can cause obstruction of the outflow of bile leading to inflammation. Other inflammatory conditions like pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often present in cats affected by CCHS. The cause of CCHS can be an underlying bacterial infection, but in general, the exact cause of most cases of CCHS is not fully understood. The clinical signs of CCHS vary, depending on the cause. The most common clinical signs associated with inflammation of the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct in cats include: Vomiting Diarrhea Weight Loss Lethargy Icterus (yellowing of skin, gums, whites of eyes) Anorexia or increased appetite Painful abdomen Fever If your veterinarian sees clinical signs of liver inflammation, they will start with a physical exam and look in your cat's eyes, ears, and mouth. They will feel their stomach to determine if enlargement of the liver or other organs is seen. Labs to screen blood for signs of inflammation and evidence of liver or other organ dysfunction will usually be recommended. In addition to baseline blood work, they may also want to run specialty blood work. Thyroid testing can rule out hyperthyroidism as a cause for high liver values. CCHS is often accompanied by pancreatitis and IBD, so testing for these conditions may be pursued. Other tests used to screen for concurrent pancreatitis and/or intestinal disease may also be performed. Your veterinarian will likely also recommend imaging, like x-rays and an abdominal ultrasound, to look for enlargement or changes in the organs. They may recommend aspirating the gallbladder during the ultrasound, where they use a long needle to collect cells and look for abnormalities or signs of infection. Occasionally, an exploratory surgery may be recommended. This allows the surgeon to collect small biopsies (samples of cells) from the liver. This is also a route to visualize the gallbladder for any abnormalities and collect bile samples to see if there is bacterial contamination. Treatment of CCHS depends on the underlying cause. Many patients with inflammation of the liver and/or gallbladder and bile duct also have inflammation in their pancreas or bowels. These conditions may need additional treatment. The majority of cats affected by CCHS are hospitalized and placed on IV fluids. Sometimes, feeding tubes are required until they are eating on their own again. Many patients are started on antibiotics like Clavamox ®, Baytril ®, or metronidazole . Often, antibiotic treatment is continued for three months or more. Some are treated with steroids, like prednisolone , to reduce inflammation. Other supplements or medications may be added to protect the liver or aid in flow of bile, like Denamarin ® or ursodiol . Medications are typically required long term to manage this condition. While most cases can be treated, many patients require regular monitoring and follow-up visits. Occasionally, surgery is recommended if a bile duct is completely obstructed by stones. If this is the case, your veterinarian will refer you to a specialist. When CCHS is caught early and treatment is started, the prognosis is good. Some cats can even be cured if they have the form that develops from a sudden onset bacterial infection. The majority of patients are managed well with medications long-term. If the condition is diagnosed immediately and the affected cat starts medications, they may recover in a matter of days. If they have already developed hepatic lipidosis, it may be weeks to months before they recover. Severity of other concurrent conditions, like pancreatitis and IBD, can also alter the timeline of recovery. Featured Image: iStock.com/miljko Brister, J. Cholangitis and Cholangiohepatitis in Cats .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hepatotoxins,Liver Toxins in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hepatotoxins are toxic substance that can damage the liver. Some toxins are known for having properties that can bring about liver damage and that almost always lead to liver toxicity. However, an individual cat may be more likely to develop liver toxicity symptoms that are related to a particular drug than another cat might under seemingly similar circumstances. This type of reaction is called an ""idiosyncratic reaction"" and can sometimes lead to unpredictable injury. The liver is the largest gland in the body, and one of the most important organs for the overall health of the body. It serves many vital functions, like production of bile (the fluid substance that helps in fat digestion), production of albumin (a protein present in blood plasma), and more importantly, the detoxification of chemicals and drugs that pass through the body. In comparison to other organs the liver is more susceptible to adverse toxicity reactions, due to its location and to its central role in the metabolism of toxic chemicals and drugs. Liver toxicity is most commonly reported as being associated with adverse drug reactions. The severity of the liver toxicity is also determined by the age, species, nutritional status, concurrent diseases, hereditary factors, other drugs being used, and previous exposure to the same or similar drugs. The extent of liver injury also depends on drug concentration, duration and frequency of drug exposure, and current liver health status. Siamese cats are at higher risk for developing liver toxicity. Though liver toxicity can occur in cats of any age, young cats are more susceptible to adverse drug reactions and liver damage due to their immature liver metabolism and excretory functions. Symptoms can vary depending on the duration of drug exposure and the type of toxin. The following symptoms may be observed in cats with liver toxicity: You will need to give a detailed history of your cat's health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible conditions that might have led to this condition, such as prior health condition, any medications your cat has been on, etc. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all of the body systems, and to evaluate the overall health of your cat. Routine laboratory tests include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. These test results should allow your veterinarian to make an initial diagnosis. The biochemistry profile will reveal abnormally high levels of liver enzymes due to liver injury. Creatine kinase, an enzyme in the tissues, will show increased levels in the blood in cases with severe muscle damage, and as certain chemicals are toxic to the muscles, its levels are also determined in animals with liver toxicity. In patients with liver toxicity, the blood protein albumin may also show increased levels. The urinalysis may indicate high levels of glucose (sugar) in the urine if kidney damage is also present. Because the liver also performs a pivotal role in blood clotting, in cases of liver damage the normal blood clotting functions may be disturbed. For this reason your veterinarian will likely order a complete blood clotting profile test for your cat. Abdominal X-rays and ultrasonography may be used to evaluate the size of the liver along with the extent of damage. Your veterinarian may also need to take a sample of liver tissue for a liver biopsy in order to confirm the diagnosis and estimate the level of damage. Your veterinarian will require three to five days to assess a realistic prognosis of liver damage in your cat so that you will have some ideas on how you will want to proceed with available treatments. In case of advanced liver damage, your cat will need to be hospitalized for intensive therapy. Intravenous fluid therapy is required for patients with deficient body fluids to maintain hydration status. In case of abnormal blood clotting functions, your cat will be given fresh whole blood or fresh frozen plasma (a normal fluid component of blood). Oxygen will be given to improve the delivery of oxygen to liver tissue. Urine output will be monitored to access the normal functions of the kidneys. In case of low blood sugar, intravenous fluids containing sugar will be administered. Antibiotics can be given to protect your cat against infections, and vitamins are also given for maintaining the liver’s metabolism functions. Intensive care is usually required for at least 3-10 days for initial stabilization. Liver damage is a serious health problem, and you will need to provide your cat with a quiet and comfortable environment so that it can properly rest and recover. Patients with liver damage usually have low body temperature, so you will need to keep your cat in a warm environment to prevent further aggravation of normal body temperature. Special dietary support is generally prescribed for these patients, as a supportive and well-balanced nutritional diet is essential for energy levels and a successful recovery. If your cat is unable to eat, your veterinarian will use a stomach tube to feed the cat until it is able to start eating on its own again. Your veterinarian will demonstrate the proper use and cleaning of the feeding tube for home care. Follow-up evaluations of your cat will include laboratory tests to evaluate the current liver functions and efficacy of ongoing treatment. Other than the drugs that have been prescribed by your veterinarian, do not give your cat any medications during the recovery period unless you have been specifically advised to do so by your veterinarian. The already damaged liver will be very vulnerable for some time after treatment, and will need to be treated with great care. Failure of this organ leads to certain death. Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the extent of the initial liver damage. In some patients liver damage is permanent and may lead to complete liver failure. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/digestive/c_ct_hepatocellular_adenoma,Liver Tumor (Hepatocellular Adenoma) in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hepatocellular adenoma is a benign tumor involving the liver cells. It stems from an over-growth of epithelial cells, which are used for secretion in the body. Fortunately, this type of tumor is very rare in cats. Mostly no symptoms are obvious in affected animals, though a rupture of a tumor mass may result in blood accumulation in the abdomen. The following are symptoms of hepatocellular adenoma in cats: The exact cause is currently unknown. Your cat’s veterinarian will take a detailed history from you and perform a complete physical examination. Routine laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis, where results are usually normal. In few animals these results may show anemia and abnormally high levels of liver enzymes. Radiographic studies may show a mass in the liver. Similarly, ultrasonography helps in diagnosis, revealing masses, hemorrhage, and other abnormalities. Your veterinarian will also take a small sample of the tumor mass under ultrasound guidance. After processing, your veterinarian will observe the sample under a microscope to confirm the diagnosis. Surgery may be attempted to excise the tumor along with some normal tissue. A large portion of the liver can be removed if required. If the tumor is bleeding, a blood transfusion may be required for your cat. Other symptomatic treatment is conducted to minimize discomfort related to this disease. Your veterinarian will perform regular checkups every three to four months to check for recurrence. Laboratory testing may also be conducted on a regular basis to see the status of the tumor. Abdominal ultrasound is an excellent tool for evaluating the status of the tumor. As benign in nature, complete excision of the tumor mass will lead to an excellent recovery in most cases. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular-toxicity/c_ct_lizard_venom_toxicity,Lizard Bite Poisoning in Cats,"PetMD Editorial In terms of lizards, the Gila Monster (Heloderma suspectum) and the Mexican Beaded Lizard (H. horridum) are the only ones to be seriously concerned about. These lizards live almost exclusively in the American Southwest and Mexico. While Gila Monsters and Mexican Beaded Lizards are normally docile and do not often attack, it is important to be aware of the danger if a bite does occur. These lizards have a tendency to bite hard and not let go. In order to release its bite, use a prying instrument to open the lizard's jaws. It has also been found that a flame held under the lizard’s jaw will cause it let go. These lizards have about forty teeth, which are grooved and not attached to the jaws very firmly, allowing them to be broken off and regrown throughout their lives. There are two glands in the back of the lower jaw where the venom is stored in a pocket next to the outside teeth and then released through a duct when the lizard bites. The venom is then projected along the grooves of the teeth and into the victim. Salivation increases with the intensity of the anger of the lizard. When that occurs, the amount of venom injected into the victim also increases. Statistically, venom from bites will be deposited into a cat about 70 percent of the time. The venom of the two lizards is very similar. However, in contrast to the venom of most snakes, it does not have an anticoagulant effect. Even so, it has been shown in lab tests to be just as potent as some rattlesnake venoms. Blood analyses, urinalyses, X-rays, and ultrasound results are usually normal but may be performed to rule out other diseases if the cause is in doubt. An EKG (electrocardiogram) to check for irregular heart rhythm will likely be necessary. Your cat’s blood pressure will also need to be checked. The cat must be taken to a veterinarian if you suspect it has been bitten by one of these lizards. The veterinarian will then prescribe treatment and medications. Pay close attention to the wound and report any changes. Most importantly, if you live in an area where these lizards are likely to roam, keep your cat confined to avoid exposure.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/neurological/c_ct_tetanus,Lockjaw in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Tetanus is a rare disease in cats, the result of a bacterium called Clostridium tetani . This bacterium is normally present in soil and other low oxygen environments, but also in the intestines of mammals and in the dead tissue of the wounds that are created due to injury, surgery, burns, frostbite, and fractures. One typical feature of this bacterium is that it can live without oxygen (anaerobic) and can remain in the environment for long periods by forming spores. Once favorable conditions are present, such as an injured animal coming into contact with the spores, they are able to release the potent toxin into the body. These potent toxins bind to nerve cells in the body and generate symptoms that are characteristic of this disease, such as muscle spasms and stiffening of the limbs. The severity of the symptoms will often depend on the number of organisms that are able to enter the body and the quantity of toxins produced in the body, but this is generally considered a serious condition warranting immediate treatment. Symptoms can appear after spores have entered the wound and germinated. The muscles around the infected wound may become rigid first. The animal may appear stiff and lame. Weakness and an uncoordinated gait can usually be observed in these animals. The symptoms may then disappear spontaneously in some animals if the infection remains local to the area in which it entered the body, while in other animals the symptoms can escalate to a generalized disease if the toxins are able to gain access to the nervous system. The symptoms related to generalized disease are: Because unattended wounds leading to bacterial contamination is the leading cause of lockjaw, outdoor cats are at higher risk. You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including a background history of symptoms. Your veterinarian will also ask about any previous injuries or traumas that might have led to the infection. After taking the detailed history, your veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination on your cat. Routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. The complete blood count may show an abnormally low or high number of white blood cells (WBCs), both indicating infection. Biochemistry testing may reveal high concentrations of an enzyme called creatine phosphokinase (CPK). This enzyme is mainly found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, but the level of this enzyme increases in the blood in response to the stiffness and damage the muscles are experiencing, which are in turn responding to the bacterial infection. The results of the urinalysis are often normal except for an increase of myoglobin in the urine. Myoglobin is a protein that is normally found in the muscles, and with constant contractions and stiffness of muscles, it starts appearing in the urine due to its release from the damaged muscles. Your veterinarian will also send samples of tissue and fluid that has been taken from the wound to the laboratory for culture. Culture testing will allow for the controlled growing of the causative organism, thereby confirming its presence in the wound. In advanced stages of this disease, your cat will need to be hospitalized. Good support and constant nursing is usually required for a period of 3-4 weeks. If your cat is not able to eat on its own, your veterinarian will place a feeding tube directly into its stomach in order to maintain its energy and metabolic needs. Because this toxin attacks the muscles and nervous system, these animals are very sensitive, making forced feedings an undesirable treatment method. Such manipulations may, in fact, exacerbate the symptoms. Intravenous fluids may be started to prevent dehydration. That will be one of the primary concerns. One of the important aspects of nursing care is to keep the cat in an environment of low light and low noise, as these animals are extremely sensitive to touch, sound, and light. Your cat will be kept sedated to prevent further aggravation of the symptoms. Drugs can be used to minimize the muscle spasm and convulsions. In combination, these types of drugs will encourage your cat to remain in a lying position for extended periods. Because of this, there is a concern for the side effects of lying in one place for too long. You should provide your cat with soft bedding, and you will need to schedule regular times throughout the day when you can turn your cat over to its other side, to prevent bed sores/ulcers from developing. In the event that your cat is not able to breathe properly, a tube will be placed into the trachea to facilitate normal breathing until the muscles have recovered from the infection. In some animals, a hole has to be made into the trachea to facilitate breathing and prevent asphyxia. If your cat is not able to pass urine, a urinary catheter will be placed to allow for the passage of urine. If your cat is constipated, an enema can be given to relieve constipation. These treatments may be applied in the home environment, in many cases. The most important consideration is the ability to maintain a sterile environment for the cat, if it is going to be receiving home treatment after the initial in-clinic care. You will need to discuss this with your veterinarian and go over the proper procedures for avoiding contamination. Drugs will be given to bind the toxin and prevent its further binding to the nerve cells. Antibiotics will also also given, either orally or by injection, to control further spread of the infection. Topical (outer) antibiotics will also be used around the periphery of the wound to control infection. Once your cat is out of danger, you’ll be allowed to take it back home where you will need to provide good nursing care until your cat has had a full recovery from the infection and its side effects. Your veterinarian will brief you on the correct usage of the various tubes that will need to be placed in your cat's body, including the stomach tube for daily feeding. As mentioned above, it is important to change your cat's resting position every few hours to prevent ulcers. Keep the wound clear and visit your veterinarian if you see any change in the color of the wound or if ulcers start appearing. Otherwise, you should expect your cat to feel sore. Your veterinarian will give you pain medication for your cat to help minimize discomfort, and you will need to set up a place in the house where your cat can rest comfortably and quietly, away from other pets, active children, and busy entryways. Setting the cat litter box and food dishes close by will enable your cat to continue to care for itself normally, without exerting itself unduly. Use pain medications with caution and follow all directions carefully; one of the most preventable accidents with pets is overdose of medication. You will need to visit your veterinarian a few more times to have your cat examined and to evaluate its recovery status. The prognosis largely depends on the severity of the disease; the more severe the disease, the less are the chances for a full recovery. Good owner compliance is required as these animals often need a long period of time for a full recovery. A strong commitment from your side will greatly improve your cat's chances for survival.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hypoalbuminia,Low Blood Albumin in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hypoalbuminemia is a condition in which the levels of albumin in the cat's blood serum are abnormally low. A protein formed in the liver and carried into the blood, albumin is responsible for regulating blood volume by controlling pressure in the blood compartment. It is also important for retaining fluid in the vascular compartment. TTherefore, a deficiency of albumin can pose grave risks for a cat, including dangerous fluid buildup. Hypoalbuminemia has not been found to occur at any particular age. Moreover, there are no apparent breed or gender predilections. Because there are so many possible causes for this condition, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. Before your veterinarian can determine an effective treatment plan, the underlying cause of the low albumin count in your cat's blood stream will need to be conclusively identified. For example, if the cause is severe liver disease, your cat may have all of the symptoms listed. A complete blood analysis and urinalysis will help your doctor to zero in on the cause. Chest and abdominal X-rays may also be required, as well as ultrasound and liver and kidney biopsies. Your cat's treatment will be dictated by the cause of the low albumin counts. Your cat may need to be hospitalized initially for treatment. If there is a fluid buildup in the chest, for instance, a chest tube may be inserted to relieve some of the buildup. Intravenous fluids may be required as well. Likewise, the type of medication prescribed will depend on the underlying cause of the albumin deficiency. Your veterinarian may prescribe physical therapy to include walks in order to improve drainage of peripheral swelling. A specific diet will also be planned once your cat is able to eat normally again. Your veterinarian will need to see your cat frequently in the early stages of treatment to monitor body weight and fluid buildup, and to take blood samples and monitor albumin concentrations. Making sure that the heart is functioning properly, and recovering from any stress that occurred as a result of the albumin disorder, is also essential.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hypocalcemia,Low Blood Calcium in Cats,"PetMD Editorial The term ""hypocalcemia"" refers to abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood. This mineral plays an important role in vital bodily functions such as bone and teeth formation, blood clotting, milk production, muscle contraction, heart pumping, vision, and in the metabolism of hormones and enzymes. Therefore, calcium deficiency is a serious condition that requires immediate treatment. Symptoms vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of the problem. However, some of the more common symptoms include: In mild cases, no symptoms may be observed until total calcium level fall well below normal (6.7 mg/dL). Albumin is a protein found in the blood and significant fraction of calcium remains bound to albumin along with free calcium in the blood. If the level of albumin falls (hypoalbuminemia) due to some other problem or disease, it also affects the total calcium level. Although it accounts for more than 50 percent of hypocalcemia cases, low levels of calcium associated with hypoalbuminemia are not generally associated with any symptom. Hypocalcemia may also be due to: There are occasions where a laboratory error reflects hypocalcemia when in fact your cat is just fine. To verify, it is important you give a detailed history of your cat’s health, onset and nature of symptoms, and possible incidence that might have precipitated the condition. Your veterinarian will also perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems to evaluate overall health of your cat. Routine tests including complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis will provide valuable information about the blood calcium levels and information about the possible inciting cause(s) of hypocalcemia in your cat. If kidney failure is the precipitating cause of hypocalcemia, complete blood count may show anemia in cats with chronic kidney failure. Anemia may also be present in patients with nutrition related secondary hyperparathyroidism or poor intestinal absorption of calcium in the gut. In case of infection or inflammation (like pancreatitis ), the number of white blood cells may have found to be abnormally high. In cats patients with pancreatitis, amylase and lipase enzymes are also found to be elevated. In cats with low levels of albumin (hypoalbuminemia), the biochemistry profile will show levels of albumin and disturbances in calcium levels. Meanwhile, if alkalosis is a cause of hypocalcemia, the blood gas analysis will reveal abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood of your cat. Cats with with kidney failure, ethylene glycol toxicity, or oxalate toxicity may present abnormally high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. Phosphorous derangements are also common in conditions leading to low calcium levels and in patients with kidney problems, ethylene glycol toxicity, oxalate toxicity, and hypoparathyroidism, biochemistry profile may show abnormally high levels of phosphorous. High phosphorous levels and hypocalcemia may also be found in the blood if enemas containing phosphorous are used in patients requiring enema; in constipation, for example. Urinalysis may reveal abnormally low concentrated urine and presence of glucose in patients with kidney problems or ethylene or oxalate toxicity. To determine if the low level of calcium is responsible for the symptoms present, your veterinarian may order further testing to find the concentration of ionized fractions of calcium, which is the active form of calcium in the blood. In case of ethylene glycol toxicity, the ethylene glycol test will be performed to confirm the toxicity. Your veterinarian will draw a blood sample from a vein of your cat and will send it to the laboratory to determine the levels of ethylene glycol in the blood. Normally, the level of ethylene glycol in the blood should be zero. If hypoparathyroidism is suspected, more detailed tests to evaluate the functions of the parathyroid gland will be conducted. Radiography of the abdomen may reveal smaller than normal sized kidneys in cats with chronic kidney failure and large-sized kidney in animals with ethylene glycol toxicity, oxalate toxicity, or acute kidney failure. Cats with nutrition related secondary hypoparathyroidism, meanwhile, may display low bone density on bone X-rays. Generally, hypocalcemia is corrected through calcium supplementation therapy under close monitoring, so as to prevent side-effects related to calcium overload. Your veterinarian will also monitor the electrocardiogram data (EKG) because calcium has a direct effect on heart and significant calcium level changes leads to abnormal EKG findings. After intravenous calcium therapy, your veterinarian may like to continue calcium supplementation for an extended period of time to prevent relapse. In addition, severe cases of hypocalcemia may require extended hospital stays. In cases with transitory hypocalcemia, the initial calcium therapy will generally resolve the problem. However, if the hypocalcemia was due to a serious health problem, it will need to be treated further to prevent future episodes. Hypocalcemia due to nutrition and parturition (the act of giving birth) may also require further action. If your cat's hypocalcemia is related to nutrition, for example, your veterinarian will make new dietary recommendations. While mothers that have recently given birth may be separated from their kittens. In these cases, the kittens can be nursed by hand until the cat's hypocalcemia has properly been addressed.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/c_ct_hypoxemia,Low Blood Oxygen in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Hypoxemia occurs when the blood in the arteries is not being oxygenated sufficiently. The condition is dangerous in cats because the oxygen that is vital for the functioning of all the organs is adversely affected. The brain can suffer irreversible damage when deprived of oxygen for even relatively short periods of time. Oxygen deficiency may also lead to anemia and/or hypoxia in the organs, which can progress to arrhythmia and heart failure. This is a serious condition that needs to be treated quickly. You will need to give your veterinarian a thorough history of your cat's health, including a background history of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. The history you provide may give your veterinarian clues as to which organs are being affected by the lack of oxygen. Your veterinarian will be looking for abnormal breathing, over-excitement, and anxiousness in your cat. Elevated body temperature and an examination for any head injuries will also be vital for making an accurate diagnosis. Samples of blood will be drawn for profiling and diagnostic purposes, and blood gas analyzers will be used for measuring levels of oxygen in the arterial blood. In addition, X-rays and echocardiograms can be employed to rule out lung and heart diseases as the cause of the oxygen deficiency in the blood. If the cause cannot be determined by any of these methods, an endoscopy or biopsy of the lung may be performed. Treatment is dependent on the underlying cause of the oxygen deficiency. Oxygen is usually given to support your cat's heart and lungs (cardiovascular system); the oxygen is delivered using a face mask placed securely around the muzzle. However, it is important to keep in mind that this treatment is not always successful. If the problem is low cardiac output, intravenous (IV) medications to strengthen muscle action will be prescribed. In case of cardiac failure, diuretics and oxygen will be administered, as well as medications to strengthen muscle action. If there is hemorrhaging, injury, or shock from infection, hospitalization will be required so that an IV can be inserted and fluids brought into the veins to stabilize the body. This will also allow oxygen to reach appropriate levels. Hypoxemia is a life-threatening condition. Therefore, observe your cat carefully following treatment. Symptoms to watch out for are a decreased ability to breathe, as well any paleness of the tissues (such as the tissues of the mouth and gums), which would signal lack of oxygen diffusion in the tissues. Frequent follow-up visits with your veterinarian will be needed for arterial blood gas measurements. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_low_potassium,Low Blood Potassium in Cats,"PetMD Editorial A cat with abnormally low concentrations of potassium in the blood is said to have hypokalemia. A vital element to an important group of blood minerals called electrolytes, potassium functions in both cellular and electricual functions, such as in the conduction of electrical charges in the heart, nerves, and muscles. Therefore, lower levels of potassium in the bloodstream will compromise the normal functioning ability of these tissues. Potassium is a vital element of both electrical and cellular functions. It belongs to an important group of blood minerals called electrolytes, which means it can carry small electrical charges. This primary positive ion is found within the cells and has a very important role in maintaining normal fluid levels within the cells and normal functions of many of the other enzymes within cells. Being an electrolyte that can carry a charge, potassium serves an important function in the conduction of electrical charges in the heart, nerves and muscles. Symptoms relate to the underlying cause of hypokalemia. Some of the more common ones include: You will need to give a detailed history of your cat's health, the onset and nature of the symptoms, and possible incidents or conditions that might have led to this condition. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam to evaluate all body systems. Routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, biochemistry profile, and urinalysis are important for the diagnosis of hypokalemia and its underlying cause. In chronic kidney failure patients, blood tests may reveal normochromic (hemoglobin contents of RBCs are normal), normocytic (overall hemoglobin levels are decreased), and nonregenerative (bone marrow responding inadequately to the increased demand of RBC) anemia. Higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (waste products [urea] in the blood that are normally excreted in the urine and voided from the body) and creatinine may also be found in patients with hypokalemia due to kidney failure. Urinalysis may reveal inadequate urine concentrating ability in patients with chronic kidney failure. In diabetic patients, the urinalysis may reveal high glucose levels and ketone bodies in urine. Abdominal X-rays, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT-Scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used to diagnose the underlying cause of hypokalemia. Your cat may need to be hospitalized if its condition is severe enough to warrant an emergency. The initial treatment includes supplementation of potassium and treatment to stabilize dangerous symptoms like irregular heart beating and paralysis of respiratory muscles. Once your cat has been stabilized, maintenance dosages of potassium will be administrated. Once the underlying disease has been diagnosed, it can be treated to prevent another episode of hypokalemia. Your cat's potassium levels may need to be measured every 6 to 24 hours during the initial phase of treatment. Call your veterinarian if you see any change in symptom at home during treatment.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/eyes/c_ct_ectropion,Lower Eyelid Drooping in Cats,"PetMD Editorial Ectropion is a condition which describes the margin of the eyelid rolling outward, resulting in exposure of the sensitive tissue (conjunctiva) lining the inside of the eyelid. Exposure and poor tear distribution may predispose the patient to sight-threatening corneal disease. It occurs most commonly in dogs but is rarely seen in cats. Protrusion of the lower eyelid — with lack of contact of the lower lid to the eye globe, and exposure of the palpebral (eyelid) conjunctiva and the third eyelid — can usually be plainly seen. Other signs and symptoms include: Ectroprion in cats is usually secondary to breed-associated alterations in facial conformation and eyelid support. The condition is seen more frequently in Persians and Himalayans. Other possible causes include: A thorough eye exam will be conducted to look for evidence of the eyelid malformation and for corneal ulcerations. A fluorescein stain, a non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light, will be used to examine the eye for abrasions or foreign objects. In cats with late-age onset, an underlying disorder will be considered as a causative factor. Nerve paralysis in the eye, a condition associated with lack of muscle tone of the eye muscles, will be considered. Your veterinarian will prescribe supportive care in the form of a topical lubricant, or an antibiotic-containing ointment, along with good eye and facial hygiene, which should be sufficient for most mild forms of the disease. Surgical treatment may be required to shorten the eyelid, and for severely affected patients with chronic ocular (eye) irritation, a radical face lift may need to be performed to correct the disorder. Your veterinarian will help you to develop a treatment plan to treat both the symptoms and any underlying conditions. This condition may become more severe as your cat ages, and will need to be monitored by your veterinarian on a regular basis so that infections, should they occur, do not become severe, and related eye disorders can be treated with immediacy. Ectropion is a condition which describes the margin of the eyelid rolling outward, resulting in exposure of the sensitive tissue (conjunctiva) lining the inside of the eyelid.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/cardiovascular/low-platelets-cats,Low Platelets in Cats,"Platelets are small, round, or oval-shaped cells produced by the bone marrow that circulate in the bloodstream. They clump together to form a blood clot that stops bleeding when there are damaged blood vessels. When a cat has a low platelet count (also known as thrombocytopenia), serious bleeding and bruising can occur if the cat suffers an injury. The bruises may vary in size and appear anywhere on the body. Thrombocytopenia is rare in cats and is considered a medical emergency due to the potential for severe internal bleeding. This condition can be fatal if it isn’t treated quickly. Possible causes of thrombocytopenia in cats include autoimmune diseases, infections, cancer , and toxicity . While thrombocytopenia can sometimes be asymptomatic initially, symptoms will later develop and may include: Bruising (ecchymosis) Uncontrollable bleeding from a wound Pinpoint red spots on the skin or gums (petechiae) Lethargy Collapse Pale pink or white gums Vomiting blood Bloody diarrhea Black, tarry stools Nosebleeds Difficulty breathing Fever Retinal hemorrhage Blood in the front chamber of the eye (hyphema) There are various possible causes for a low platelet count in cats. Here are a few of the common ones. Infectious diseases, such as: Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) Feline distemper (panleukopenia virus) Mycoplasmosis Ehrlichiosis Salmonellosis Histoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis Heartworm disease Cytauxzoonosis Autoimmune disease —Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia Cancers — Lymphoma , leukemia, hemangiosarcoma Medications , such as: Carprofen Trimethoprim-sulfa Methimazole Phenobarbital Other chemotherapeutic medications Rodenticide (rat poison) toxicity Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)—A blood-clotting disorder All cats, regardless of breed, age, or gender, are equally at risk for developing thrombocytopenia. Veterinarians rely on several factors to diagnose this condition, including: Medical history —It is important to discuss with your veterinarian any symptoms that your cat is displaying at home, such as nosebleeds, collapse, or bruising of the skin. Physical exam —A veterinarian will examine your cat’s mouth for pale gums and red spots (petechiae) and look for bruising on the body, as well as wounds that continue to bleed. A fever or heart murmur may also be found during an exam. Cats with a low platelet count can also appear to be healthy during a physical exam with no indications of having a bleeding disorder. Blood cell count —This blood test measures a cat’s platelet count as well as the counts of white and red blood cells. Blood smear —A manual platelet count can help determine if a cat’s platelets are low. This test also helps identify platelet clumping and can help confirm if a previous low platelet reading was false. Anti-platelet antibody test —This blood test screens for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, a condition in which a cat’s immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets. Coagulation tests —Blood clotting tests may be recommended to check for DIC, assess if a cat has a bleeding disorder, or may have ingested rodenticide. Bone marrow biopsy —A biopsy of the bone marrow can be analyzed to check for cancer, infectious agents, and other diseases that might prevent a cat’s ability to produce platelets. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. For example, if an infection is causing a low platelet count , then treating the infection should return the platelet count to normal. Cats with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia are prescribed immunosuppressive medication like prednisolone . Some cats with this condition can be slowly tapered off medication completely , while others may require long-term use at the lowest effective dose. For cats with low platelet counts due to cancer, treatment options may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Cats with hemorrhaging or a severely low platelet count are typically hospitalized and given a platelet-rich plasma transfusion to restore their platelet count to normal. Bloodwork is repeated every few weeks after a transfusion to recheck the platelet count to see if the level remains normal or decreases again over time. Medications to stimulate platelet production—such as vincristine and erythropoietin—may be prescribed. Recovery depends on the underlying cause, the severity of the disease, and your cat’s response to treatment. It’s ideal to keep a cat with a low platelet count indoors and minimize their activity level, as even a minor injury could lead to uncontrollable bleeding. Monitor your cat’s skin regularly to make sure that any bruises are fading and new bruises are not forming. Also observe your cat’s food and water intake, energy level, and their urination and defecation to determine if they are normal or abnormal during their recovery. Some infectious diseases—such as ehrlichiosis and mycoplasmosis—are treatable in roughly four weeks. However, other causes of a low platelet count in cats—such as heartworm disease and feline leukemia—have no curable treatment option. Immune-mediated disease will require frequent blood work to determine if immunosuppressive medications can be tapered off over time. Treatment for immune-mediated thrombocytopenia can take several months or may even be lifelong. Some causes for low platelets can be prevented. Here are some recommendations for protecting your cat: Administer heartworm , flea, and tick prevention year-round to protect your cat against heartworms, ehrlichiosis, cytauxzoonosis, and mycoplasmosis. Keep rodenticide far out of your cat’s reach or do not use it at all. Keep your cat indoors to reduce their risk of infectious diseases. Do not feed a raw diet to your cat , as this can increase the risk of salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis. Keep your cat up to date on their feline leukemia and feline distemper vaccinations. Report any adverse side effects to your veterinarian when giving oral medications to your cat. If you’re getting a kitten from a breeder, choose a reputable breeder who ensures their breeding cats and kittens are negative for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus. Also have your kitten tested for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus at your local veterinary hospital. Have routine blood work done on your cat every six to 12 months for screening. Some causes of a low platelet count are not preventable, such as immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and cancer. A cat’s platelet count should typically range from approximately 200,000 to 600,000 per microliter, though variations can occur based on the reference lab used. Platelet clumping may result from the anticoagulant within the blood collection tube. If clumping occurs, it can lead to a falsely low platelet count (pseudothrombocytopenia). Adhering to proper blood collection techniques can minimize the risk of platelet clumping. Featured Image: bymuratdeniz/E+ via Getty Images Abrams-Ogg ACG: Thrombocytopenia.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/endocrine/c_ct_hypoparathyroidism,Low Production of Parathyroid Hormone in Cats,"PetMD Editorial An absolute or relative deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood, a condition called hypoparathyroidism, may be characterized by low levels of calcium in the blood, which can lead to hypocalcemia. The parathyroid hormone regulates calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, normally increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from the bone. The parathyroid glands are small, hormone-secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands, which are in turn located at the front of the neck, in alignment with the larynx and trachea. Mixed-breed cats are most commonly diagnosed, and it often appears secondary to surgical removal of the thyroid glands for treatment of excessive levels of thyroid hormone (known as hyperthyroidism). Less commonly diagnosed forms are due to parathyroiditis, and atrophy of the parathyroid glands. The average age of diagnosis is 12 to 13 years, with a range of 4 to 22 years of age. Spontaneous hypoparathyroidism occurs on average around two to three years of age, with an age range six months to seven years. This condition occurs most commonly in cats that have damaged parathyroid glands, or have had the parathyroid glands removed during surgical removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy) in the course of being treated for excessive levels of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism). It may also occur due to a decrease in tissue of the parathyroid glands, usually of unknown cause. Immune-mediated inflammation of the parathyroid glands may also be seen. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your cat, taking into account the background history of symptoms that you are able to provide. Standard testing, including a complete blood profile will be conducted, as well as a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. The results of these tests will usually return normal in the case of hypoparathyroidism; however, they are important in discounting any other underlying disorders. Because there are several possible causes for the symptoms described here, your veterinarian will most likely use differential diagnosis. This process is guided by deeper inspection of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated appropriately. The main problems associated with hypoparathyroidism that must be differentiated from other disease processes are seizures, weakness, muscle trembling, and twitching. Some of the causes that will need to be ruled out are heart related diseases, metabolic diseases, such as hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hepatoencephalopathy (liver disease that affects the brain's functioning). Neurological causes that will need to be ruled out are inflammatory diseases, tumors, or epilepsy. An exploration of the cervical section of the throat may reveal that the parathyroid glands are absent or have atrophied (wasted). Your cat may need to be hospitalized initially for medical management of low levels of calcium in the blood, at least until the clinical signs are controlled. Other treatment will be dependent on whether any other underlying conditions have been diagnosed. Emergency treatment is usually only needed for certain patients, such as those with primary hypoparathyroidism, or hypoparathyroidism that is secondary to procedures that have been used to correct excessive levels of thyroid hormone or excessive levels of parathyroid hormone -- that is, procedures that have been medically used to lower the amount of parathyroid hormone in the blood, and have resulted in levels of parathyroid hormone that are now too low. If your cat has been diagnosed with hypocalcemia, low calcium levels in the blood, your doctor will prescribe long-term treatment for the condition. Vitamin D will be needed indefinitely, with the dosage amount determined by your veterinarian, based on your cat's needs. Calcium supplements can be given by mouth, again, with the type and dose of calcium supplement directed by your veterinarian. If your cat is suffering from hypoparathyroidism related to a thyroidectomy, there is a good chance that they will recover normal functioning of the parathyroid glands within several months time. Both low levels of calcium in the blood and excessive levels of calcium in the blood are concerns that will need to be managed over the long-term. Initially, your veterinarian will want to see your cat frequently in order to follow your cat's progress and to make changes to care as needed. Once serum calcium is stable and normal, your veterinarian will assess serum calcium concentration monthly for six months, and then every two to four months. Was this article helpful?

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/lung-cancer-cats,Lung Cancer in Cats,"Charlotte Hacker, PhD iStock/Valerii Apetroaiei via iStock / Getty Images Plus Cancer in cats is a concerning diagnosis—and lung cancer is especially alarming. But understanding your pet’s condition can help. Lung cancer in cats is when tumors, or masses of cancerous cells, develop in the lungs. Lung cancer is clinically called pulmonary (relating to or affecting the lungs) neoplasia (uncontrolled abnormal cell growth). Lung cancer can be primary or secondary. Primary lung tumors start in the lungs. Secondary, or metastatic, lung tumors start in another part of the body and spread to the lungs. Lung tumors damage the lungs and affect their ability to move oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the bloodstream. Tumors may also squeeze the lungs or allow fluid to accumulate around the lungs, making it more difficult for your cat to breathe . Primary lung cancer in cats is rare. Of 5,643 cat cancer cases presented to the North Carolina State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital for evaluation, only 39 (0.69%) were primary lung tumors (pulmonary carcinomas). However, primary lung cancer is diagnosed more often than it was 20 years ago. This could be due to better detection methods, an increase in exposure to environmental carcinogens (tobacco smoke, radon, and other types of pollution), and cats living longer lives. On the other hand, the lungs are a common organ for cancer to metastasize to from other parts of the body, so secondary lung tumors are more prevalent than primary. Primary lung tumors have a better prognosis, but survival rates are affected by many factors, including tumor type, severity, and when the cancer was first diagnosed. Secondary lung tumors typically have a poor prognosis because cancer is already present in other parts of the body. A study that investigated the different types of primary lung tumors in cats found three main types of cancer: Pulmonary adenocarcinoma —Pulmonary adenocarcinoma is a cancerous tumor that usually develops from the glands that line the bronchi (airways within the lungs). 82% of primary lung tumors in cats were pulmonary adenocarcinomas. Bronchogenic carcinomas —Tumors arising from other tissues within the bronchi were responsible for another 11% of primary lung tumors. Squamous cell carcinoma —The remaining 7% of tumors involved two types of squamous cell carcinomas, which arise from the outermost layer of the epithelial tissue (the squamous epithelium) that lines airways. There are many different types of secondary lung tumors in cats. Cancer of almost every sort that is located virtually anywhere in the body can metastasize to the lungs. Signs of all types of lung cancer in cats can include: Difficulty breathing Rapid breathing (more than 40 breaths per minute) Loud breathing Weight loss Lethargy Coughing that may contain blood Vomiting or diarrhea Lameness due to lung digit syndrome (tumors spreading to one or more of the toes) Few cancers have a single known cause. Lung cancer risk is likely dependent on environmental, genetic, and other factors. Males and females appear to be equally affected, but older cats are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer. Research on 39 cats found that Persians were four times more likely than any other breed to develop lung cancer. Exposure to cigarette smoke has been linked to lung tumors in pets and may increase the chance that a cat will develop the disease. Your veterinarian will initially perform a complete physical examination, including listening to your cat’s heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood work and urinalysis will probably be recommended to evaluate your cat’s internal organs. Chest X-rays are often the first step in identifying tumor presence. Staging (searching for spread to other body locations) is usually recommended as well. A CT scan or MRI can help the vet better visualize lung tumors. CT scans can reveal a tumor’s exact location, how invasive it is, and any potential spread to other parts of the body. If there is still uncertainty in a diagnosis, your cat’s veterinarian may perform a fine needle aspirate, where a small needle is used to take a sample of the tumor cells and view them under a microscope. A tissue biopsy is more invasive and involves taking a piece of the tumor for analysis. This method can most definitively diagnose lung cancer in cats. To provide the most accurate information to your veterinarian—and to ensure you don’t forget anything—write down your cat’s symptoms as you observe them prior to your veterinary visit. Your cat’s veterinarian likely has records of previous care, but you may want to check that all prior history, including anything involving tumors, is accounted for. If cancer is diagnosed, your cat’s vet may refer you to a veterinary oncologist who can help you decide the best treatment plan moving forward. Your options will depend on the size, location, and stage of your cat’s cancer and your cat’s overall health. Surgery to remove the portion of the lung with the tumor, or the entire lung itself, may be recommended for single tumors that are slow-growing. Tumors that cannot be removed may be treated with chemotherapy or radiation. Radiation can help slow the growth of primary tumors. Chemotherapy is more likely to be recommended if the cancer has spread. If treatment is not possible, palliative care (symptom relief) is the next best option. Palliative care may include: Pain medication Fluid therapy Nutritional support Cough suppressants Anti-inflammatory medications (including corticosteroids such as prednisolone and dexamethasone ) Antibiotics (to fight secondary infections) Thoracocentesis (to help remove fluid build-up around the lungs) Radiation therapy may inflame lung tissue and have a sunburn-like effect on the skin. Chemotherapy can also have side effects, such as nausea , vomiting, and fatigue. Cats who receive surgery may require intensive care, such as oxygen therapy, before being released. Once home from surgery, there are several ways you can support your cat’s care: Keep them in a quiet confined space for at least two weeks. Be attentive to their breathing. Limit their exposure to anything that could irritate their lungs, like secondhand smoke and other air pollutants. Make follow-up vet appointments. Follow aftercare instructions and give medication as prescribed. Recovery times vary. Post-op recovery times are typically shorter for thoracoscopic procedures (a small camera is placed into the chest and incisions made with instruments) than thoracotomy procedures (traditional open chest surgery). Your vet will instruct you on the best items for recovery after treatment. These may include: Surgical recovery body suit Recovery cone Soft collar Pet pen Waterproof blanket To promote your cat’s health and reduce lung cancer risk: Routinely take your cat to the vet to help catch cancer early. Reduce your cat’s exposure to environmental carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke. Consider running an indoor air purifier if you live in an urban environment. The link between city living and lung cancer in cats is not well-established, but cities are known to have higher amounts of air pollution, which may contribute to tumor development .

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/lung-fungal-infections-cats,Lung Fungal Infections in Cats,"Fungus includes any of a group of organisms that produce spores and feed on organic matter, including molds, yeast, mushrooms, and toadstools. When spores of a fungal organism invade the lungs, a pulmonary infection can develop. Cats become infected by breathing in spores floating in the air. The spores typically enter through the nose and make their way to the lungs, eventually growing into a yeast form. The presence of the fungal organism in the lungs triggers the body’s defenses to form lesions in the lungs. This leads to symptoms such as coughing, rapid and labored breathing, fever, and discomfort. Fungal infections in cats are rare, but they can be fatal if not treated. The four most common lung fungal infections in cats are: Caused by a fungus known as Blastomyces dermatitidis It is most common in the river basins of Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, and Ohio, but is also found around the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway. The fungus is native to Africa, India, Europe, Central America, and a few Canadian provinces. Coughing and difficulty breathing are the most common symptoms. Caused by the Coccidioides fungal species This type of fungus prefers arid and semi-arid environments of the US Southwest, Mexico, and Central and South America. Coccidioidomycosis has many symptoms, ranging from being asymptomatic (no visible symptoms) to severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing. A fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans or Cryptococcus gattii C. neoformans is found worldwide, while C. gattii is native to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and Central and South America. Cats acquire the fungus by inhaling the spores from the soil, decayed wood, or bird guano, especially from pigeons. Upper respiratory symptoms are most common, such as: Sneezing Hard swelling over the bridge of the nose Polyps in the nasal passages Nasal discharge Difficulty breathing Lower respiratory disease is less common, but if the fungus infects the lungs, cats will have coughing as well as rapid and labored breathing. Caused by Histoplasma capsulatum This fungus is a common inhabitant of soil that contains fecal matter from birds and bats. It can be found globally, and in the United States it is predominantly found along the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. The spores spread primarily to the lungs, as well as to the lymph nodes in the chest. Cats that live or spend time outdoors are more at risk for acquiring a lung fungal infection. According to some research, the Havana Brown, Siamese, and Abyssinian breeds are believed to be more prone to blastomycosis, while Siamese, Himalayan, Birman, and Ragdoll cats are prone to cryptococcosis. Persian cats have been reported to have a higher incidence of histoplasmosis. However, it is not clear whether any particular breed is at higher risk of contracting a fungal lung infection. Fungal infections have a wide range of symptoms, including: Coughing Difficulty breathing Increased respiratory rate Discomfort Decreased appetite Lethargy Fever The environment plays an important role as to where certain fungi flourish. Blastomycosis fungi prefer areas where there is natural water and acidic soil that is sandy and moist. Cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis fungi grow best in guano or decaying wood. Coccidioidomycosis fungi grow best in arid and semi-arid areas after a dust storm. Once these fungi establish an area to grow, they release spores into the air that a cat may breathe in. These spores then invade the lungs and other areas of the cat's body. There are several diagnostic tests that can be done to determine if a cat has a lung fungal infection. A few of the options: Oral anti-fungal medication is often prescribed to treat lung fungal infections in cats. The type of medication used and the length of treatment varies, based on the type and severity of the infection. A lung fungal infection usually requires several months of treatment. The following anti-fungal medications are commonly prescribed for treatment of lung fungal infections in cats: Recovery time varies, based on the type of lung fungal infection and severity of the infection. The length of treatment for any of the above anti-fungal medications is based on antigen titers (tests). When the titer reaches zero, treatment is discontinued. Titers are usually conducted every 3-6 months to check for a relapse of infection. If the titer is unchanged after 2 months of treatment, then a different treatment plan is prescribed. If a cat has a relapse of infection, they are treated again. The best way to reduce risk for infection is to keep cats strictly indoors, reducing the chance to breathe in harmful fungal spores. Indoor cats are less likely to acquire lung fungal infections but are still at risk. Indoor cats should be kept away from house plants, as the soil in the pots could contain fungus. Unfinished basements should also be off limits to cats because they commonly have dirt floors that may contain fungi. Cats are given oral and/or injectable anti-fungal medication over several months for treatment. Recurrence of infection can occur, so monitoring titer levels after treatment is also important. Cats breathe in fungal spores from the air. Once the spores enter the nasal passages, they can then spread to the lungs and cause infection. Yes, cats can fully recover from fungal infections. However, prognosis depends on the type of fungus and how quickly it is diagnosed and treated. If the infection is severe and affects multiple organs, not just the lungs, then prognosis is guarded. Based on two studies involving 52 cats with histoplasmosis, about half lived through the end of each study. The median survival time between the two studies varied. In one study, the median survival time was 1.5 years and in the other study the median survival time was about 2 years. Morgan, R. Veterinary Partner. Histoplasmosis (Zoonotic) Feline.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_lung_lobe_torsion,Lung Lobe Twisting in Cats,"PetMD Editorial In lung lobe torsion, one of the lung's lobes becomes twisted, which results in obstruction of the bronchus and vessels, including the veins and arteries. The obstruction of the blood vessels causes the lung lobe to engorge with blood, which results in necrosis and death of the affected lung tissue. This may lead to many complications, including coughing up blood, tachycardia, or shock. Though lung lobe torsion is rare in cats, it is still a very serious condition, one which will require immediate veterinary attention. Lung lobe torsion is inconsistently found with pre-existing conditions such as trauma, neoplasia, and chylothorax. However it also occurs spontaneously, due to a thoracic or diaphragmatic surgery, or, on occasion, due to an unknown cause (idiopathic). You will need to give a thorough history of your cat’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to your veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC). These tests may reveal valuable information for initial diagnosis and may show signs of infection, anemia. It will also reveal the level of immune response of your cat. If the number of white blood cells is abnormally lower than the minimum normal range, the prognosis is very poor. Your cat’s veterinarian may decide to take a small sample of the accumulated fluid for further evaluation, while ultrasound, computed tomography, and radiographic studies often reveal more details about the problem. Loss of normal architecture and blood vessels, along with opacification of the affected lung are usually seen in an X-ray. In some cases, surgery is required for definitive diagnosis and treatment. Your cat may need to be hospitalized for intensive care and treatment, especially if surgery is required, which is often the treatment of choice to remove the affected lobe and correct other abnormalities. If abnormal fluid or blood is present, your veterinarian will place a chest tube to allow for drainage. If your cat is not able to breathe normally, ventilator support is given to assist in breathing. Oxygen therapy, fluids, and antibiotics are also typically added to treatment protocol. And if the cat survives, shrinking and fibrosis of the affected lobe will be seen. After surgery, your cat may feel sore and need pain killers, as well as cage rest, for a few days. However, most animals recover fully after a successful operation. The chest tube is often kept in for a few days to allow drainage of fluid. Your veterinarian will describe the proper handling of this tube. If you see any untoward symptoms, including breathing problems, immediately call your cat’s veterinarian. Otherwise, follow his or her instructions and bring the cat in for regular examinations. Was this article helpful? Sign up for weekly pet health tips and insights from our veterinarians."
https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/infectious-parasitic/lungworms-cats,"Lungworms in Cats: What Are They, and How Do You Treat Them?","julichka/iStock / Getty Images Plus via Getty Images Lungworms in cats are small (less than 1 cm) parasites that infect cats around the world. It’s estimated that up to 50% of cats allowed outside may be infected with lungworms , but this number is much lower in indoor pet cats. A cat gets infected with lungworms by eating an animal that’s infected with tiny lungworm babies, called larvae. The larvae then work their way from the cat’s digestive tract to the lungs, where the larvae grow into adult worms (about eight to nine days after infection) and lay eggs (about four weeks after infection).

The cat coughs up the larvae and swallows them, and then the larvae are passed into the cat’s stool where the life cycle restarts. Adult lungworms live in the lungs for nine months or longer. The worms cause irritation and disease in the lung tissues, which can lead to no symptoms, mild symptoms, or serious lung issues including pneumonia or trouble breathing , which is a medical emergency. Lungworms in cats can be tricky to diagnose because the symptoms can look like other diseases such as asthma , heartworm disease , bronchitis, and pneumonia. Cats infected with lungworms may seem healthy with no clinical signs. Lungworms in cats can cause a wide range of symptoms, including: Cats get lungworms when lungworm babies (larvae) are eaten. This can happen when a cat eats a rodent, small bird, frog, toad, snake, lizard, snail, or slug that is infected with the lungworm larvae. If your cat has spent time outdoors and is having symptoms including coughing, wheezing, or breathing issues, your veterinarian may suspect that your cat has lungworms. To diagnose lungworms in cats, your veterinarian may offer tests, including: Physical examination, which will include listening to your cat’s lungs and heart. Microscopic identification of worms from the stool ( fecal examination ) using a specific method called the Baermann technique (sent to a lab or done by your vet). This is the most accurate way to diagnose lungworms . Chest X-rays (done by your vet). Your vet will screen your cat for abnormal changes in their lungs. If you can see worms in what your cat has coughed up, your veterinarian may want to do a microscopic test to identify the worms (sent to a lab or done by your vet). Lungworms are treatable with either oral and/or topical medications prescribed by your veterinarian. Your vet may prescribe one of these treatments for lungworms: Advantage Multi™ Topical Solution NexGard® COMBO Profender™ Topical Solution Revolution ® Fenbenazole Lungworms may be killed with a single course of treatment, but most cats are treated for two months. Depending on the severity of your cat’s infection (number of worms) and your cat’s health status (amount of lung damage), your vet may prescribe multiple dosages of an anti-parasitic medication for you to give on a schedule. For very sick cats with severe breathing problems, veterinarians may need to prescribe additional medications, such as ones that decrease airway swelling ( corticosteroids ) and ones that help your cat breathe easier (bronchodilators). It’s important to carefully follow your vet's directions for treatment and to schedule follow-up visits and tests to make sure this treatment is working for your cat's lungworm infection. Cats that are mildly infected with lungworms can completely recover within a few weeks with anti-parasitic treatment. If your cat has symptoms, your vet may recommend an immune system supplement such as Imuquin ® powder on your cat’s food, and an omega fatty acid supplement to help decrease airway swelling and provide immune system support. Wrapping medications in Pill Pockets ™ can help! The best prevention for lungworms in kittens and cats is to keep them indoors to stop them from hunting and eating animals infected with worms, to give them monthly parasite prevention year-round for life such as Revolution ®, and to have wellness visits with your veterinarian . Yes, most cats infected with lungworm can be cured with prescription anti-parasitic treatment. Some lungworm infections may even clear up on their own without treatment. Rarely, young kittens, weakened cats, or cats with lowered immune systems (immunocompromised) can’t be cured. Yes, an indoor cat can get lungworm if they eat an infected rodent, snail, or slug that comes inside the house, but this is unlikely with good pest control. Outdoor, free-roaming cats who hunt and eat infected rodents, birds, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, snails, and slugs are at the highest risk of getting lungworms.

https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/musculoskeletal/c_ct_patellar_luxation,Luxating Patellas in Cats,"A luxating patella is a physical condition in which the kneecap, called the patella, moves out or becomes dislocated from its normal position (luxates). In people, this condition is sometimes referred to as a “trick knee.” In cats, the knee joint is set between the thigh (femur) and the shin (tibia). The kneecap itself is an oval-shaped bone set in a deep groove called the trochlear groove at the end of the thigh. A patella luxation occurs when the kneecap moves away (either inside or outside) from this groove. If it moves to the inside, it’s known as a medial patellar luxation (MPL). When the kneecap moves outside the groove, a vet will typically diagnose it as a lateral patellar luxation (LPL). For either type, a luxating patella is diagnosed based on a grading system (I to IV), with the severity increasing as the grades go higher. The grades are: Over time, the kneecap’s constant movement in and out of the trochlear groove will rub away the cartilage in the joint, causing inflammation and eventually arthritis. Arthritis causes pain and stiffness and can eventually lead to the breakdown of other vital ligaments in the knee joint, such as the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL), making the cat more prone to CCL tears. Symptoms of luxating patella in cats include: Occasional or constant limping Difficulty jumping onto things like beds and tables “Skipping” on a back leg (holding it up for a few steps then replacing weight onto that leg) As the grade of the luxation increases, so does the lameness. Cats with grades III and IV tend to show persistent lameness and, if both of their knees are affected, they can even have a bow-legged or dropped stance/crouched appearance in the back legs. With arthritis, a cat may yowl, cry, or make other noises indicating pain or discomfort when getting up from their current position. Your cat may also be unwilling to move around, making it easy to confuse this behavior with lethargy or poor appetite, when in reality the cat is just too sore to get up, play, and eat or drink.

Most patellar luxations in cats are medial, meaning the kneecap moves within the trochlear groove, and are caused by abnormalities in the cat's anatomy. In other words, they are usually due to genetics. For example, if the trochlear groove is too shallow, the kneecap has a greater opportunity to shift. This can also occur from other abnormalities, such as if the ligaments that overlay the kneecap are off center, or if the leg bones are curved. Injury can also cause this condition, such as from falling or other blunt force trauma. If the cause is trauma, a cat will suddenly show signs of a luxating patella. If it is caused by genetics, the onset of symptoms may be more gradual as the cat ages. Patellar luxation (along with hip dysplasia) is seen most commonly in Abyssinians, the Devon Rex, and the domestic shorthair. A luxating patella is typically diagnosed during physical examination by a veterinarian. Your veterinarian will massage and feel the knee and manipulate the patella to see if movement is possible. They will also monitor your cat’s gait while he walks to note any lameness or “skipping” motions. A grade I patellar luxation is usually discovered incidentally during a cat’s regular examination, because most cats will not show any obvious signs of pain or lameness unless they have sustained an injury that causes the joint to swell. If the luxation is chronic, the vet may detect a grating sound when palpating the affected joint. Radiographs of the knee joint are usually taken to determine the severity of arthritis, if any, and to check for any other abnormalities. This is especially important if the luxation is due to trauma. Treating luxating patella depends on its severity, as well as the cat’s age, their clinical signs, and any other anatomical abnormalities or injuries. Mild to moderate luxation may be treated with rest and anti-inflammatory medication while more severe cases often require surgical correction. Surgery should be considered for any cat that continually or intermittently limps, lameness that lasts over 1 to 4 weeks, or is diagnosed with a grade III or IV patellar luxation. Grade I luxations may be treated with rest, anti-inflammatory medication, and similar supportive therapy. Grade II luxations may require surgical correction, depending on age, other injuries, or abnormalities. Grade III and IV luxations should receive surgical correction. Surgery is recommended sooner to avoid arthritis developing in the joint. If surgery is required, a vet can deepen the grove (called trochleoplasty) to tighten the joint capsule and surrounding soft tissue to improve stability that can be used to repair a luxating patella. Other surgeries might be done to correct the patellar ligament (called tibial tuberosity transposition). After surgery, the vet will usually suggest that the pet parent restricts exercise for at least 2 weeks, while encouraging mild activity. If the luxation requires more aggressive surgical correction, the vet may recommend 4 to 6 weeks before any exercise. As with treatment, recovery depends on the severity of the luxating patella. It usually involves appropriate rest as well as pain and anti-inflammatory medication, and the cat should regain full use of the leg. If arthritis has already developed in the joint, there may be intermittent soreness/pain in the leg. Prognosis for grade I, the mildest type, is typically positive, even without surgery Prognosis for grade II and III is typically positive although the cat may require surgical correction Prognoses for grade IV and chronic luxations are guarded due to a higher likelihood of arthritis Cats with grade IV patellar luxation (or had a previous femoral fracture or knee surgery) have a higher risk of complications. Managing the condition for all grades may include: Reducing weight Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) Pain medications (such as Gabapentin or Buprenorphine) Joint supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, omega 3/6 fatty acids) and polysulfated glycosaminoglycan (Adequan) Be aware of your cat’s environment, especially if they seem uncomfortable or are recovering from surgery, help to avoid the stairs, and place the litter box and food/water near the cat’s sleeping area. Luxating patella in cats can be painful if moderate to severe, or if arthritis has formed in the joint. Usually this pain can be controlled with rest and anti-inflammatory medications. Weight reduction is very important. The less weight placed on the joint, the less luxation and pain. Using joint supplements is helpful to reduce inflammation in the knee joint. If you’re concerned that your cat has a luxating patella, call your veterinarian to schedule a consultation. The sooner a patellar luxation is diagnosed and treated, the better the prognosis for full return to function on the affected leg. A grade I luxating patella typically occurs infrequently and is often not visible. Though they can’t correct themselves, cats often live a full life without pain or lameness. Grade II, III, and IV luxating patellas cannot correct themselves due to the underlying anatomical abnormalities. References Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, Feline Health Center.
