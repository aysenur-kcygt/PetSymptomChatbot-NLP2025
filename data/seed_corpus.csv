Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Irish Setter Setters originated before the advent of hunting birds with game, when dogs that spotted birds were expected to crouch so that hunters could throw a net over the birds without it getting snagged on the dog. The oldest known setter dates back to the 1300s, but the Irish setter is more recent, probably from the 1700s. The breed is thought to be the result of crosses between English setters (and to a lesser extent, Gordon setters) and spaniels and pointers. These crosses produced red and white setters that were fast working and could be seen from a distance, qualities desired by Irish bird hunters. Around 1800, the first kennel of solid red setters was established. These dogs gained a reputation for both their hunting ability and striking color. Solid red setters and red and white setters diverged into different lines, now known as Irish setters and Irish red and white setters. In 1862, a dog named Palmerston changed the look of the Irish Ssetter because of his unusually long head and slender build. Most modern Irish setters can be traced back to him. The breed gained more popularity as a show dog compared to field dog, although it can still perform in both venues. In the 1970s, the Irish setter rose to rank among the most popular breeds in America. Its popularity has since declined dramatically. Makes a tirelessly enthusiastic and active companion. Usually very good with children, but can be too boisterous for small children. Eager to please but easily distracted. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Enjoys retrieving and hunting. Makes a good housedog if given adequate exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a very long walk, jog, or energetic games. Field lines tend to be more energetic. A good candidate for dog parks. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is fairly long, silky, and either flat or slightly wavy. The coat needs brushing and combing two to three times a week to prevent mats. It should be bathed once a month. Some clipping and trimming is needed every month to maintain optimal looks. Shedding is average. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a balanced a puppy food.

https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/aspca-poison-control/people-foods-avoid-feeding-your-pets,People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets,aspca.org,unknown,general,"People Foods to Avoid Feeding Your Pets. Skip to content ASPCA Poison Control Phone Number: (888) 426-4435 ASPCA Poison Control experts have put together a handy list of common people foods to avoid feeding your pet. As always, if you suspect your pet has eaten any of the following foods, please note the amount ingested and contact your veterinarian or poison control at (888) 426-4435. Alcoholic beverages and food products containing alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, incoordination, depression, difficulty breathing, tremors, changes in blood pH, coma and even death. Alcohol is rapidly absorbed after ingestion, so it’s important to take prompt action in seeking veterinary attention if your pet has had exposure. Yeast dough can rise and cause gas to accumulate in your pet’s digestive system. This can be painful and cause the stomach to bloat, and potentially twist, becoming a life-threatening emergency. The yeast also produces alcohol as a by-product in the stomach environment once ingested, so raw bread dough exposures can develop complications of alcohol toxicity as well (see above). Chocolate, coffee, and caffeine are similar in that their toxicity concerns stem from their methylxanthine concentrations (a group of compounds found in these products). When ingested by pets, methylxanthines can cause vomiting and diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors, seizures and even death. The darker (higher cacao percentage) the chocolate, or the higher the caffeine content, the greater the risk for toxicity. White chocolate has the lowest methylxanthine content while baking chocolate and cocoa powder have the highest concentrations. Because pets do not possess significant amounts of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk), milk and other dairy-based products can cause diarrhea or other digestive upset. Raw meat and raw eggs can contain bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli that can be harmful to pets and humans alike. Raw eggs contain an enzyme that can interfere with absorption of certain vitamins, leading to skin/coat problems. Feeding your pet raw bones may seem like a natural and healthy option that might occur if your pet lived in the wild, however, this can be dangerous for a domestic pet. Dogs/cats might sustain injury or obstruction to the gastrointestinal tract when ingesting bones, which could be serious and require surgery.

Citrus The stems, leaves, peels, fruit and seeds of citrus plants contain varying amounts of citric acid and essential oils that can cause irritation and possibly even depression if ingested in significant quantities.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier The soft coated wheaten terrier originated in Ireland as an all-around farm dog. It exterminated vermin, guarded the homestead and rounded up stock. Its date of origin is unknown, but it was established by the 1700s. Like many farm breeds, it early history is largely undocumented. It is likely to have been crossed with other dogs as various needs and circumstances arose. In 1937 the SCWT was granted breed status in Ireland. This allowed it to compete in dog shows. An Irish Championship of the time required a SCWT to win not only in the show ring, but to prove itself as a hunter of badgers, rabbits and rats. The first SCWT came to America in 1946. The AKC recognized the SCWT in 1973. It is most popular today as a companion and show dog. Makes a fun-loving and affectionate companion. Its gentle and playful nature makes it a good match for children. Friendly toward strangers. Usually good with other dogs and pets. Makes an attentive watchdog, and adequate protection dog. It is eager to please but can be headstrong. Does best with reward-based training involving food and games. Makes a well-behaved housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a moderate walk or short jog, or a run in an enclosed area, every day. Because it loves to run and hunt, it should only be let loose in a safely enclosed. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thick soft coat provides some protection against cold and wet weather. Coat is abundant and soft; it has no noticeable undercoat. The coat needs brushing or combing every other day. Bathing and trimming every other month is needed to maintain the correct look. The coat is easier to maintain if it is clipped to about 3"". The coat does not tend to shed. SCWT conformation is for a moderate build. You should be able to feel the ribs under the coat, but they should not be too noticeable. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Chow Chow Recent DNA studies indicate that the chow chow is among the 14 most ancient breeds recognized by the AKC. Its origin is unclear except that it has been known in China for hundreds or even thousands of years. They may have been used as hunting dogs for the Chinese nobility, and later kept in monasteries. Other accounts claim they were used for food in Mongolia and Manchuria. The dogs were brought to England in the late 1700s, and were dubbed chow chows by the English. The name is probably derived from a term meaning Oriental knick knack. Only in the late 1800s, with the sudden interest in exotic breeds aroused by the advent of dog shows, were chows earnestly brought to the western world. Queen Victoria was a proponent of the breed. The AKC recognized the chow chow in 1903. In the 1980s, the breed soared in popularity in America, peaking when it was the 6 th most popular breed. Since then they have plummeted in popularity, their numbers falling by 91% in the last decade. The black or blue tongue is a breed characteristic, as is the somewhat stilted gait. Makes a devoted and protective family member. Generally tolerant of children, but may not be playful enough for them. As with any large dog, they should be supervised when around children. Not overly demonstrative. Reserved toward, and even wary of, strangers. Not friendly towards strange dogs. Usually good with small pets. Tends to be independent and stubborn. Rebels against forceful methods. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a calm and alert housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a leisurely walk, short jog, or quick game. It is not physically suited to overly vigorous exercise. Enjoys cold weather. Becomes overheated easily. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. The chow chow comes in two coat types. The rough coat is straight and off-standing. The smooth coat is hard and smooth. Both coat types have wooly undercoats. The rough coat needs brushing every other day to remove dead coat and prevent serious matting. The smooth coat needs brushing once or twice a week. Shedding is above average. Cow chows tend to stay in good weight or to be slightly overweight. You must use your hands to feel beneath the thick coat. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Papillon The papillon's ancestors were spaniels that were developed at least by the 1300s to flush birds into nets or to waiting falcons. Some smaller spaniels were probably bred with Oriental toy dogs such as the Japanese chin to create a lapdog version of the spaniel. These dwarf spaniels were used to serve as lap and foot warmers, surrogate hot water bottles, and for companionship. They became extremely popular throughout Europe by the 1500s. The Court of Louis XIV of France was especially fond of dwarf spaniels, and played a role in developing the French version. Most of these dogs had drop ears, but the erect ears appeared soon after. Even today, both types can be found in the same litter. Papillon means butterfly in French, referring to the general outline of the face and ears. The drop-eared type is known as the phalene, which means moth, again referring to the look of its face and ears. In Europe the phalene is known as a separate breed, the continental toy spaniel. By 1900, papillons were popular show dogs in Europe and had made their way to America. The AKC recognized the papillon in 1915. Makes a loving and entertaining companion. Extremely good with children. Children must be careful around such a small dog, however. Very affectionate. Makes a good lapdog as well as fun playmate. Sensitive; some can be timid. Eager to please and quick to learn. Does best with reward-based training involving food and games. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Enjoys retrieving. One of the best toy dogs in the sports of obedience and agility. Also excel as therapy dogs. Makes a calm but alert housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a short walk or energetic games. Its exercise needs can be met by indoor games, but it needs the chance to get outside and sniff new smells and see new sights every day. Many papillons have been trained to use indoor potty systems. A good candidate for dog parks, but should be kept separate from larger dogs. Obedience training provides mental exercise. Coat is long, silky, and straight. The coat needs brushing and combing twice a week. Shedding is average. Papillons tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Remember, it does not take much food to feed such a small dog, and small snacks can easily add too many calories. Papillon puppies should be fed often to prevent hypoglycemia, a serious condition to which very small puppies are prone. Frequent small meals of high protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates may help guard against this condition.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Weimaraner In the 1800s, German hunters made a concerted effort to produce an all-around gundog that could hunt game of all sizes, even deer and bear. Some of the breeds used in the mix were the Bloodhound, Red Schweisshund, and several early pointing breeds. The origin of the breed's distinctive gray color is unknown, but it was an early feature of the breed. The new breed was initially called the Weimar Pointer because the effort to produce it was sponsored by the court of Weimar. The German Weimaraner Club oversaw the breed's progress using stringent standards for breeding. They would not allow Weimaraners to be sold to non-members. In 1929, an American gained entry into the club and was able to bring back two Weimaraners to America, where they elicited great interest. The breed's early talent in obedience competitions aroused further interest, and its hunting ability won over sportsmen. The AKC recognized the breed in 1943. Makes an energetic and protective family member. Gentle and playful with children, although may be too boisterous for small children. Demanding of attention. Loves to run and hunt. Only moderately outgoing toward strangers. May be aggressive toward strange dogs and other pets. Learns quickly. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Some can whine or bark a lot. Makes a fairly calm and alert housedog if given adequate exercise. If not given enough exercise, can be overactive and destructive. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, or preferably, long jog. A well-fenced yard is essential. Hunting is the favored exercise. Swimming and retrieving are also favorites. This is not a breed for an inactive owner. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is short and sleek. It requires brushing once a week to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Weimaraners tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Bichon Frise The bichon is a descendent of the barbichon family of dogs, which in turn descends from the barbet, a large water dog. Bichons were divided into four types: Maltaise, Bolognese, Havanese and Tenerife. The Tenerife, developed on the Canary Island of Tenerife, was brought to Italy in the 14th century. They quickly became favored pets of the upper class. After a series of French invasions of Italy in the 1500s, the dogs were brought back to France where they once again became favored pets of the aristocracy. For some unknown reason, the breed fell out of favor with the upper class. It survived as a street dog, performing tricks with organ grinders to entertain passersby for money. World War I nearly brought about the demise of the breed, but a few people tried to save it. In 1933, a breed standard was drawn up and it became an official breed, the bichon frise. Bichons came to America in the 1950s, and received AKC recognition in 1971. Makes an affectionate and exuberant companion. Playful, gentle and very good with children. Very friendly to strangers, other dogs and other pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Eager to please, bright and responsive. Some tend to bark a lot, which should be discouraged from an early age. Some can be difficult to housetrain. Makes a lively and alert housedog. A walk around the block once or twice daily, plus a vigorous game, will meet its exercise needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many bichons have been trained to use indoor potty systems. Dog parks can work out well as long as bichons are not expected to mingle with much larger dogs. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thick coat provides some protection against cold weather, but its fairly small body size nonetheless makes it vulnerable to the cold. Coat is curly, coarse and dense. Brushing and combing every other day is necessary to prevent matting. Most people have their dogs professionally clipped every month. Shedding is below average. No breed is actually non-allergenic, but bichons may cause fewer allergies compared to most other breeds. Bichons tend to stay in good weight. The thick coat can sometimes obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Toy Poodle Although the standard poodle is the original version of the poodle, it wasn't long before smaller versions appeared as well. The first good evidence of toy poodles in Europe dates from about 1700, although it almost certainly predates that time. The toy poodle was originally used as a lap dog, circus performer, and gypsy trick dog. The French aristocracy became enamored with the poodle and adopted it as its own. It eventually became the national dog of France. The French upper class enjoyed styling and even dying its hair in a variety of fashions. The first evidence of toy poodles in America dates from 1846. The AKC recognized the poodle in 1887. Only later did they split the breed into three varieties according to size. After a period in the 1920s during which they almost vanished from the American scene, poodles staged a comeback in the 1930s. Poodles were the most popular breed in America from 1960 to 1982, the longest continuous run of any breed. Makes a biddable and affectionate companion. Playful and very good with children, although very young or unruly children may hurt it with rough play. Friendly to strangers, other dogs and other pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food, games or praise. Eager to please, bright and responsive, poodles are among the easiest of dogs to train. Loves to learn tricks. Excels at obedience and agility competitions, as well as therapy dog work. Some may bark a lot, but can be easily trained not to. Makes a well-mannered and alert housedog. A daily walk around the block, coupled with several play sessions, will meet its exercise needs. Enjoys retrieving small objects. Does well in dog parks as long as large dogs are segregated. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thick coat provides some protection against cold weather, but its small body size makes it vulnerable to chilling. Coat is curly, harsh and dense. Brushing and combing every other day is necessary to prevent matting. Most people have their dogs professionally clipped every six weeks. Most people opt for a pet clip where the hair is fairly short all over. Shedding is below average. The eyes should be checked regularly for hair or lashes that may irritate their surface. No breed is actually non-allergenic, but poodles may cause allergies in fewer people compared to other breeds. Hair growing inside the ears may need to be plucked out or clipped. Poodles tend to stay in good weight or to be a little overweight. The thick coat can sometimes obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Small snacks can cause weight problems in tiny dogs. Toy poodle puppies should be fed often to prevent hypoglycemia, a serious condition to which very small puppies are prone. Frequent small meals of high protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates may help guard against this condition.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Mastiff The mastiff breed is the namesake of the larger mastiff family of dogs. The mastiff family is an ancient group of dogs that was used in hunting, battle and in gladiator sports. By medieval times mastiff-type dogs were almost commonplace. They continued to be used for large game hunting, bear and bull baiting, dog fighting, and guarding. Mastiffs were favorites among many of the nobility. The mastiff of Sir Peers Legh was famous for standing over his master after Sir Legh fell in battle, protecting him for hours. The dog became the foundation of the Lyme Hill mastiffs, which figured prominently in founding the modern mastiff some 500 years later. Although a mastiff is said to have been aboard the Mayflower, the earliest documented mastiff in America was not until the 1800s. The AKC recognized the mastiff in 1885. World War II decimated the breed in England. American mastiffs were used after the war to reconstitute the breed. Makes a loyal and protective companion. Gentle and generally good with children, but may be overly protective of them when around strangers. As with all large dogs, dogs and children should always be supervised. Tends to be aloof toward strangers. Early socialization is essential. Fairly friendly toward strange dogs. Good with other pets. Learns quickly, but can be stubborn. It tends to rebel against forceful methods. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a calm and well-mannered housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a moderate walk or short jog. The mastiff prefers cold weather to warm. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is short, straight, and coarse. The coat needs only occasional brushing, once every week or so, to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Be prepared for drool. Mastiffs tend to stay in good weight or be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Its rootstock is unknown but it may have been derived from the same ancestors as the border collie. At that time both rough and smooth coated versions of the breed, first called Scotch collies, existed. The smooth coated dogs drove the sheep and the rough coated dogs stayed out with the flocks. Queen Victoria, a purebred dog enthusiast, became enamored of the collie and added her first to her kennel in 1860. Her involvement with the breed caught the interest of other dog fanciers and of upper society people who wanted the same breed as the Queen's favorite. In 1886, an official breed standard was drawn up. Collies came to America both as working sheep dogs and elite pets. Author Albert Payson Terhune attracted more pet owners to the breed through his stories of his Sunnybank collies in the 1920s and 30s. Lassie movies and television shows cemented the breed's reputation as a family dog. The smooth collie has never shared the popularity of the rough collie. Makes a gentle and devoted companion. Playful and very good with children Good with other dogs and pets. Does best with reward-based training involving games, food or praise. Learns quickly, and is eager to please. Overly enthusiastic barking can be a problem. Makes a well-mannered housedog, given adequate exercise. It needs a long walk, good run or energetic play session every day. Does well in dog parks. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Collies enjoy cold weather, but cannot live outside in it. Coat of the rough variety is long, thick and harsh. It requires a good brushing session once or twice a week. Coat of the smooth variety is short, hard and flat. It requires a brief brushing once a week. Shedding is average to above average. Collies tend to stay in good weight.You must feel under the coat to make sure the dog is neither too thin nor too fat. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

and bull-baiting dogs can be found as early as the late 1700s, but no evidence exists that these crosses were perpetuated. The documented history of the bullmastiff traces to the late 1800s. Gamekeepers for large estates in England needed a courageous dog to catch and subdue poachers on their land. The dog was to creep up silently and subdue, but not maul, the trespasser. The cross between a mastiff and bulldog provided a dog that combined the speed and strength to do the job. The breed was so adept at its work that it was dubbed the ""gamekeeper's night dog."" Dark brindle was preferred because it blended into the darkness at night. Lighter fawns later became popular with estate owners who wanted a flashy looking guardian reminiscent of a mastiff. Breeders eventually aimed for a pure breeding strain that had the appearance of being 60 percent mastiff and 40 percent bulldog. The Kennel Club in England recognized the breed in 1924; the AKC recognized it in 1933. Makes a loyal and protective companion. Gentle and generally good with children, but may be overly protective of them when around strangers. As with all large dogs, dogs and children should always be supervised. Devoted. Not easily roused, but fearless when the situation calls for it. Tends to be suspicious of strangers. Early socialization is essential. Not very friendly toward strange dogs. Good with other pets. Tends to be stubborn. Rebels against forceful methods. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a calm and well-mannered housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a moderate walk or short jog. The bullmastiff prefers cold weather to warm. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is short, straight, and coarse. The coat needs only occasional brushing, once every week or so, to remove dead hair. Deep facial wrinkles may need cleaning and drying. Shedding is average. Be prepared for drool. Bullmastiffs tend to stay in good weight or be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Rhodesian Ridgeback South African Hottentot tribes hunted with dogs that often had a ridge of hair running the opposite direction along their back. In the 1500s and 1600s, Boer settlers arriving in South Africa brought with them mastiffs, Great Danes, greyhounds and other breeds that then interbred with native Hottentot dogs. In 1875, Dr. David Livingston published one of the earliest engravings of a ridged dog in his memoirs, Missionary Travels in South Africa . Also in 1875, missionary Charles Helm traveled to Rhodesia, bringing two dogs from his home in South Africa. A big game hunter, Cornelius von Rooyen, borrowed the dogs to try them at hunting. He was so impressed with their hunting ability that he worked for the next 35 years to have them breed true. The dogs were especially adept at holding lions at bay, and were dubbed lion dogs. In the 1920s, the name was changed to Rhodesian ridgeback and a standard of perfection was produced. In the 1930s and 40s the breed came to Europe and America. Today it is among the most popular of AKC registered hounds in America. Makes a loyal and protective companion. Good with children, but can be overly boisterous for small children. Makes an excellent watchdog and good protection dog. It is strong-willed, powerful and somewhat independent. Reserved with strangers. Generally good with other dogs and pets. Obedience training is a necessity. Does best with reward-based training involving food plus a firm hand. Makes a well-mannered housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a good walk or jog, or a run in an enclosed area, every day. Not generally a good dog for dog parks, but varies with individuals. Its short coat provides little protection against cold weather. Coat is short and close. The coat needs weekly brushing and occasional bathing. Shedding is below average. The ridge of hair growing in the opposite direction along the midline of the back is distinctive and leaves no doubt as to whether it is a ridge or raised hackles. A few ridgebacks are born without ridges. Ridgebacks have a moderate build, lean yet muscular. You should be able to feel the ribs, but they should not be too noticeable. Some ridgebacks tend to put on too much weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Dachshund Short-legged dogs have been known since ancient times, but the beginnings of the Dachshund aren't clear. The first recorded history of them was in the 1700s, in Germany, where they were used mostly for hunting badgers underground. By the early 1800s smooth, wire, and longhaired Dachshunds were recorded. In 1839, Prince Albert married Queen Victoria, bringing Dachshunds to England with him. In 1870, the first recorded Dachshunds arrived in America. In 1885, the AKC registered its first Dachshund, named Dash. When World War I broke out, Dachshunds became unpopular in America because of their association with Germany. In 1919, the AKC changed the breed's name to Badger Dog in an attempt to distance it from Germany. They changed it back in 1923. Only 23 Dachshunds were registered in 1923. By 1930, they had moved up to become the 28 th most popular breed, and by 1940, the 6 th most popular. They have remained among the most popular breeds in America since. The Dachshund comes in three varieties: smooth, long, and wire coats, of which the smooth is the most popular. The varieties are shown separately but may be interbred. The breed also comes in standard and miniature sizes. In most countries they are also shown as separate varieties, but the AKC does not divide them by size. Makes both a devoted lap dog and saucy playmate. Fairly playful with family children, but children must be supervised because they could easily hurt a miniature Dachshund. Tends to be a one-person, or at most, one-family dog. Reserved, even suspicious, toward strangers. Fairly good with other dogs and pets. Tends to be independent, curious and bold, so care must be taken to prevent wandering and exploring. Likes to hunt and dig. Some bark a lot. Learns quickly, but tends to have a stubborn streak. Does not do well with force-based training methods, but is very good with reward-based training involving food. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Although many of its physical exercise needs can be met with indoor or backyard games, it still needs the mental stimulation of walking and sniffing on walks. A walk around the block once or twice daily will meet its outdoor needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many Dachshunds can be trained to use indoor potty systems. Dog parks are not generally a good idea unless only small dogs are allowed together. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Smooth Dachshunds hate the cold. Because of their small size and short coat, they lose body heat rapidly. Coat is short, soft, and glossy. Brushing once a week will remove dead hair. Shedding is below average. Dachshunds have a tendency to become obese. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Remember, it does not take much food to feed a small dog, and small snacks can easily add too many calories.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds English Cocker Spaniel One of the largest families of dogs, spaniels were developed at least by the 1300s to flush birds into nets or to waiting falcons. Later in their development they also found and pointed birds. Spaniels became specialized by their size, the terrain they hunted over, and the type of birds they hunted. In 1892 the smaller land spaniels that specialized in hunting woodcock were designated as Cocker Spaniels. In 1878, the AKC recognized the Cocker Spaniel. As the Cocker became the most popular breed in America in the 1930s and 40s, and also a successful show dog, the type diverged such that the show dogs winning in American rings tended to be smaller, longer legged, and rounder headed than the original stock from England. In 1936, the AKC split the breed into two varieties: the traditional English Cocker Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels. In 1946, they split them into two breeds (Varieties can be interbred; breeds cannot). Only in America are these names used; elsewhere they are known as Cocker Spaniels and American Cocker Spaniels, respectively. The English Cocker Spaniel remains the breed more true to the type of the original Cockers, but in America they are not as popular as American Cockers. Makes a cheerful and devoted companion. Usually very good with children. Eager to please and quick to learn. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Enjoys retrieving and hunting. Makes a calm housedog if given adequate exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, jog, or energetic games. A good candidate for dog parks. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is fairly long, silky, and either flat or wavy. The coat needs brushing and combing two to three times a week to prevent mats. Hair on the head and ears should be clipped every month, and hair on the feet and tail should be cut every two months. Special attention should be paid to keeping the eyes clean and clear of stray hairs. The ears must be checked weekly for problems. Shedding is average. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a balanced a puppy food.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Standard Poodle The standard poodle is the original version of the poodle. It probably descended from the Barbet, a curly-coated dog found in France, Russia, Hungary, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The German version of the Barbet became the dog we now know as the Poodle. The original poodle was a water dog known for its retrieving abilities. In fact, the word ""poodle"" comes from the German word ""pfudel,"" which means ""puddle"" or ""to splash,"" a reference to the poodle's ability as a water retriever. In France, the poodle was known as the caniche or chien canard, both names in reference to its duck-hunting ability. The poodle later worked as a circus performer, military dog, guard dog and guide dog. The poodle's hair cut originated as a working clip for retrieving in cold water. The hair was cropped close to cut down on its weight and drag, but left longer over the head and chest for warmth. Although it's often claimed the hair was left longer on the joints and tail tip for warmth and protection, evidence suggest that the style arose later, as decoration when the poodle became a performing circus dog. Regardless, the clip became more accentuated over time. The French aristocracy became enamored with the poodle and adopted it as its own. It eventually became the national dog of France. The AKC recognized the poodle in 1887. Only later did they split the breed into three varieties according to size. After a period in the 1920s during which they almost vanished from the American scene, poodles staged a comeback in the 1930s. Poodles were the most popular breed in America from 1960 to 1982, the longest continuous run of any breed, although standards were not as popular as the other sizes. Makes a biddable and fun-loving companion. Playful and very good with children. Friendly to strangers, other dogs and other pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food, games or praise. Eager to please, bright and responsive, poodles are among the easiest of dogs to train. Excels at obedience and agility competitions, therapy dog work, and even contraband detection. Makes a calm yet alert housedog. A long walk or jog, or several vigorous games, every day will meet its exercise needs. Poodles have even been trained to pull a dog sled. Enjoys retrieving. Standard poodles do well in dog parks. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Swimming is a favored exercise, but a full coat can weigh down a dog. Its thick coat provides some protection against cold weather, but it cannot withstand prolonged exposure unless exercising. Coat is curly, harsh and dense. Brushing and combing every other day is necessary to prevent matting. Most people have their dogs professionally clipped every six weeks. Most people opt for a sporting clip where the hair is fairly short all over. Originally, poodle's coats were corded, so they hung in long dreadlocks. This takes a lot of work and is difficult to wash, so the style has fallen out of favor. Shedding is below average. The eyes should be checked regularly for hair or lashes that may irritate their surface. Hair growing inside the ears may need to be plucked out or clipped. While no dog is non-allergenic, poodles seem to cause allergic reactions in fewer people. Poodles tend to stay in good weight. The thick coat can sometimes obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

If you believe that your animal is ill or may have ingested a poisonous substance, or if you have any further questions regarding the information contained in this database, contact either your local veterinarian or the ASPCA Poison Control's 24-hour emergency poison hotline at (888) 426-4435."
https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/aspca-poison-control/poisonous-household-products,Poisonous Household Products,aspca.org,unknown,general,"Poisonous Household Products. Skip to content ASPCA Poison Control Phone Number: (888) 426-4435 Have you ever wondered if a particular household cleaning product or human medication is toxic to your pets? ASPCA Poison Control has provided the following guide for several household items. Please remember that this guide is for general information only and is not intended to help assess or manage animal exposures, or any subsequent time-sensitive medical issues. If you suspect your pet has been exposed to any toxic substance, contact your veterinarian or call poison control immediately at (888) 426-4435. Most cleaning products are safe to use around dogs and cats as long as they are used per labeled directions. Obtain veterinary advice when using cleaning products around birds, as they are extremely sensitive to the fumes. Bleach Ingestion of undiluted bleach can cause injury to the mouth and esophagus, especially if it is a high concentration or has a high pH. Diluted bleach can be safely used to clean pet toys and kennels, as long as it is diluted, thoroughly rinsed and the bleach odor has dissipated prior to letting the pet back around the items. Vinegar and Water A solution of vinegar and water is often used as a natural alternative to commercial cleaning agents. Vinegar is acidic and can cause stomach upset and irritation, however, it is not generally an issue if, prior to use, it is diluted, rinsed and allowed to dry. Enzyme Based Cleaners Most enzyme-based cleaners tend to cause mild stomach upset so ensure that these products dry prior to letting the pet into any area where they were used. Cosmetics Lip Gloss and Lipstick The ingestion of lip gloss and lipstick can cause stomach upset. Some products, especially those that are moisturizing, contain laxatives, such as shea butter, which can cause diarrhea. These signs tend to be mild, however. Ensure that your pet did not eat any plastic or packaging, which can cause a foreign body obstruction in the stomach or intestines and can be a medical emergency. Foundation, Mascara, Blush, Eye Shadow These cosmetic products are generally safe if pets ingest them, causing only mild stomach upset. However, any packaging ingested can pose a risk of a foreign body obstruction in the stomach or intestines and can be a medical emergency. Moisturizing Lotions A small ingestion of non-medicated moisturizing lotion (such as licking lotion off of a person’s skin) is only likely to cause mild stomach upset. However, larger ingestions can cause more severe stomach upset. If your pet vomits, there is a potential for the lotion to be inhaled into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia, which can be serious. Petroleum Jelly Petroleum Jelly is a laxative and any ingestion can cause stomach upset. Larger ingestions can cause more severe stomach upset. If your pet vomits, there is a potential for the petroleum jelly to be inhaled into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia, which can be serious. Bar Soap Dogs especially love to eat bar soap, so it’s best to keep it out of reach at all times. However, if they do ingest some, it generally only causes mild stomach upset. If they vomit, bubbles sometimes come out of their noses, which can be disconcerting and make them sneeze a bit, but severe signs are not expected. Toothpaste Toothpaste can contain fluoride or xylitol. In most cases, there is not enough fluoride ingested to see significant signs, but if a large amount is ingested, fluoride can cause severe stomach upset, irregular heartbeats, low blood pressure and life-threatening electrolyte changes. Xylitol is a sweetener that can cause low blood sugar levels or damage to the liver, if enough is ingested. The amount of xylitol present in toothpaste can vary significantly from brand to brand, with some toothpaste containing none and some containing higher amounts, so it’s best to keep all away from pets. Laundry Detergent Pods and Liquid Laundry Detergent Liquid laundry detergent and laundry detergent pods can cause stomach upset and irritation to the mouth and throat. In some cases, serious and life-threatening symptoms can occur. Dryer Sheets Most laundry dryer sheets, especially those that are unused, contain cationic detergents. These detergents can cause severe chemical burns and ulcers to the pet’s mouth, esophagus and stomach. Additionally, the sheets can pose a risk of a foreign body obstruction in the stomach or intestines and can be a medical emergency. Fabric Softeners Most fabric softeners also contain cationic detergents which can cause severe chemical burns and ulcers to the pet’s mouth, esophagus and stomach.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Siberian Husky Recent DNA studies indicate that the Siberian husky is among the 14 most ancient breeds recognized by the AKC. The nomadic Chukchi people of northeast Asia developed them, probably from spitz stock, as sledge dogs. During the Alaskan gold rush, sled dog racing became a favorite sport. In 1909, a team of Chukchi huskies from Siberia competed in the All-Alaska Sweepstakes. These dogs were smaller than their competition, and didn't arouse much admiration except from one racer, who immediately imported 70 of them to train for the 1910 race. His three teams placed first, second and third in that race, bringing the breed into the spotlight. In 1925 the Siberian husky gained worldwide fame for racing 340 miles in six days to deliver serum to diphtheria-stricken Nome. Lead dogs Balto and Togo became national heroes. A statue of Balto stands in central Park. The Iditarod dog sled race commemorates this feat. The AKC recognized the breed in 1930. Siberian huskies served in the military as search and rescue teams during World War II. The breed remains one of the most popular of the Arctic breeds. Makes an exuberant and adventurous family member. Good and playful with children. Loves to run, and may roam for miles if the opportunity arises. May not come when called. Affectionate and demonstrative. Outgoing toward strangers. May be aggressive toward strange dogs, but is good with family dogs. Usually good with household pets, but not always good with strange ones. Tends to be independent and stubborn. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a fairly calm and alert housedog if given adequate exercise. If not given enough exercise, can be overactive and destructive. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, or preferably, long jog. A well-fenced yard is essential. Games can also help provide exercise. Enjoys very cold weather, and likes to spend time outside when it's cool. Becomes overheated fairly easily. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is straight, somewhat flat-lying and of medium length, with a soft dense undercoat. It requires brushing once or twice a week, more often when shedding. Shedding is above average. Siberianhuskiestend to stay in good weight. You must use your hands to feel beneath the thick coat. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Boston Terrier The Boston Terrier originated, not surprisingly, in Boston, Massachusetts. The coachmen of wealthy Bostonians interbred their employers' dogs to create dogs for themselves. Around 1865, a cross between an English Terrier and a Bulldog produced a dog named Hooper's Judge. Judge weighed in at 30 pounds, but in subsequent generations smaller dogs arose as his descendents were bred to smaller females, and probably to French Bulldogs as well. By 1889, the breed was established to the extent that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club. A new name had to be found, however, because a breed called the Bull Terrier already existed, and its fanciers complained. After several name suggestions, including ""Roundheads,"" the name Boston Terrier was agreed upon. The AKC recognized the Boston Terrier in 1893. This may be the shortest period between the creation of an entirely new breed and AKC recognition. At first, color and markings were immaterial, but by the early 1900s, the breed's distinctive coat pattern became essential. Between 1905 and 1935, the Boston Terrier was consistently the first or second most popular breed in America. Makes a devoted and lively companion. Playful and affectionate. Very good with children. Somewhat reserved toward strangers. Usually good with strange dogs, although may initially challenge them. Good with other pets. Clever, but can be stubborn. It tends to rebel against forceful methods. Does best with reward-based training with good control and leadership. Some bark a lot. Makes a calm and alert housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a walk, short jog, or energetic games. Ball-chasing is a favored game. Obedience provides needed mental exercise. Does not tolerate cold well because of its small size and short coat. Does not tolerate heat well because of its flat face. Coat is short, flat and fine. The coat needs only weekly brushing to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Boston Terriers tend to stay in good weight or tend to be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Greyhound Greyhound-like dogs have been depicted in hunting scenes since the days of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. By Saxon times, the greyhound was well established in Britain. In 1014 the Forest Laws prohibited anyone but nobility from keeping greyhounds near royal forests unless they had been lamed so they couldn't hunt. The Forest Laws helped establish greyhounds as dogs of the nobility, who were more interested in using greyhounds for sport rather than for catching dinner. During the 1800s, coursing stag and hare with greyhounds became a favored sport of the upper class. By the 1800s, greyhounds were brought to America, where they were used to course game in the Midwestern plains. Hare coursing became a spectator sport by holding coursing contests in enclosed parks. In 1926, greyhound racing using a mechanical lure was introduced. This began the selection of greyhounds for short bursts of speed, soon establishing them as the fastest breed of dog. Today, greyhounds in America are of two divergent types: the more well-known racing, or NGA (National Greyhound Association) greyhound and the less popular AKC greyhound. Retired NGA racing greyhounds make up most of the pet greyhound population. Makes a loyal and gentle companion. Can be clownish at times, but its independent nature may make play frustrating for children. It is not a retriever at heart. It is not very good at coming when called, and may tend to run off to chase things, particularly small fast animals. If raised with cats, can be good with house cats. Retired racers may or may not be good with cats. Good with other dogs and with children. Learns quickly, but is easily bored. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Makes a very quiet housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a moderate walk or jog, or a sprint in an enclosed area, every day. Most greyhounds should not be let off leash unless the area is securely fenced. A few games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its short hair provides little protection against cold weather. A coatmay bebeneficialin cold weather. Coat is short and thin. Some NGA greyhounds have a slightly thicker coat. The coat needs weekly brushing and occasional bathing. Shedding is below average. Greyhound conformation is for a naturally lean build, but owners often overfeed them. You should be able to feel the ribs, but they should not be too noticeable. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Samoyed The nomadic Samoyed people of Siberia relied on their herds of reindeer for food, and their dogs to keep the reindeer under control and to guard them against predators. The dogs also occasionally hunted large game and pulled sledges. They lived in the tents and slept with the children to help keep the children warm. Early samoyeds, including the first imports to England in the late 1800s, were not always white. Queen Alexandra received one of the early imports and became a proponent of the breed. Many of today's dogs can be traced back to dogs she bred. The first samoyed came to America in 1906 as a gift from Russia's Grand Duke Nicholas. Samoyeds became popular as sled dogs because of their tractable nature. They were part of polar expeditions conducted by Shackleton, Scott, and Amundsen.Samoyeds were on the team that first reached the South Pole. They gained much popularity following World War II. Makes a gentle yet bold companion. It is playful and clever. Sociable with strangers, children, dogs and other pets. It is a fast learner, but can be independent and stubborn. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. If bored, it tends to dig and howl and may get into mischief. Makes a quiet housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a moderate walk or jog, or a good run in an enclosed area, every day. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. It especially loves to pull sleds. In cold weather it may prefer to stay outside. In warm weather it is usually happier in air-conditioning. Its thick coat provides good protection against cold weather. Coat is made up of a soft thick undercoat covered by a straight, harsh outer coat that stands off from the body. The coat needs weekly brushing---more when shedding Shedding is above average. Samoyeds tend to stay in good weight, although some are inclined to be overweight. The thick coat can obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Shetland Sheepdog The Shetland sheepdog originated on the Shetland Islands of Scotland in the 1800s. They almost certainly were derived from early collie-type dogs that also provided root stock for collies and border collies. The terrain and sparse vegetation of the islands favored smaller livestock, which in turn only needed smaller herding dogs. The Shetland sheepdog herded sheep, ponies and chickens, keeping them away from cultivated fields in a land with few fences. Shetland sheepdogs were first exhibited as Shetland collies in England, but when collie fanciers objected, the name was changed to Shetland sheepdog. The breed's popularity followed that of the collie, with many families opting for what they thought of as a miniature collie. The Shetland sheepdog remains a steady favorite as a family dog throughout the world. Makes a loyal and biddable companion. Playful and gentle with children, an excellent child's companion. When excited, it can nip at heels in play. A one family dog, tending to be aloof, even shy, toward strangers. Early socialization so that it willingly accepts new people is important. Very good with other dogs and pets. Some can be timid. Fast and eager learners that enjoy being directed. Sensitive to correction. Does best with gentle, reward-based training involving food, games or praise. Most bark a lot. One of the most accomplished breeds in the sports of agility and especially, obedience. Makes a calm yet alert housedog. Its exercise needs can be met with a long walk, short run or backyard games. Herding and agility are favorite physical and mental outlets. Games and tricks can provide needed mental exercise. Shelties very much enjoy learning. Coat is long, harsh and straight, with a short dense undercoat. Brushing and combing every other day is necessary to prevent mats. Shedding is above average. Shelties tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Beagle The Beagle originated in the Middle Ages, probably the result of crosses between the Harrier and other hounds. Its smaller size made it possible to follow it on foot as it trailed hare. The first use of the word Beagle is found in 1475. The origin of the word is uncertain, but it may be derived the old French ""be'geule"", meaning ""gape throat"" in reference to the baying voice of the hounds. Alternatively, it may refer to the diminutive size of the hound, possibly deriving from the Old English ""begele,"" or the French ""beigh"" or the Celtic ""beag,"" all of which mean small. Beagles existed in several sizes, including the then popular pocket-sized Beagles that measured only about 9"" tall at the withers. The smaller Beagles could be followed by less athletic sporting enthusiasts. The first mention of the Beagle in America was in 1642, but the modern Beagle did not emerge in America until the late 1800s, when more Beagles from England arrived. Beagles became popular hunting companions and field trial competitors, but these jobs were eclipsed by their popularity as family dogs. More recently, they have gained recognition as contraband, termite and mold detection dogs. They also have a long history of use as research subjects. The most famous Beagle of all is an animated one, Snoopy, of Peanuts fame. The Beagle has been among the ten most popular breeds in America for decades. Makes both an exuberant playmate and adventurous companion. Excellent and playful with children, but its independent nature may be frustrating for children at times. Gregarious toward strangers. Very good with other dogs and pets. Likes to follow its nose, tends to wander, and does not come when called. Likes to hunt. Some bark and bay loudly and frequently. Learns quickly, but is easily distracted. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Makes a fairly calm housedog if given adequate exercise. Enjoys jogging, but not running marathons. Although many of its physical exercise needs can be met with backyard games, it prefers to walk and sniff and explore. Care must be taken if allowed off leash because the Beagle tends to get caught up in following scent trails, and it's not overly obedient when it comes to returning. Beagles tend to do well at dog parks. Beagles do best in moderate climates. Coat is short, close and hard. Brushing once a week will remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Beagles love to eat anything and have a tendency to become obese. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Miniature Poodle The earliest version of the poodle may have been the barbet, a curly-coated dog found in France, Russia, Hungary, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. The barbet may have descended from Asian herding dogs and water dogs. The German version of the barbet became the dog we now know as the poodle. The word ""poodle"" comes from the German word ""pfudel,"" which means ""puddle"" or ""to splash,"" a reference to the poodle's ability as a water retriever. The poodle later worked as a circus performer, military dog, guard dog and guide dog. The poodle's hair cut originated as a working clip for retrieving in cold water. The hair was cropped close to cut down on its weight and drag, but left longer over the head and chest for warmth. Although it's often claimed the hair was left longer on the joints and tail tip for warmth and protection, evidence suggest that the style arose later, as decoration when the poodle became a performing circus dog. Regardless, the clip became more accentuated over time. The French aristocracy became enamored with the poodle and adopted it as its own. It eventually became the national dog of France, and to this day many people refer to it as the French poodle, even though it is a German breed. Smaller versions were bred in France, and by the late 1800s had been perfected. One of these became the miniature poodle. The AKC recognized the poodle in 1887. Only later did they split the breed into three varieties according to size. In the 1920s, poodles were so unpopular they all but died out in America. They staged a comeback in the 1930s. They were the most popular breed in America from 1960 to 1982, the longest continuous run of any breed. The miniature is the most popular variety. Makes an affectionate and fun-loving companion. Playful and very good with children. Friendly to strangers, other dogs and other pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Eager to please, bright and responsive, poodles are among the easiest of dogs to train. Excels at obedience and agility competitions, therapy dog work, and even contraband detection. Some tend to bark a lot, which should be discouraged from an early age. Makes a lively and alert housedog. A walk around the block once or twice daily, plus a vigorous game in the yard, will meet its exercise needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many miniature poodles have been trained to use indoor potty systems. Dog parks can work out well as long as Miniature Poodles are not expected to mingle with much larger dogs. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Swimming is a favored exercise, but a full coat can weigh down a dog. Its thick coat provides some protection against cold weather, but its fairly small body size nonetheless makes it vulnerable to the cold. Coat is curly, harsh and dense. Brushing and combing every other day is necessary to prevent matting. Most people have their dogs professionally clipped every six weeks. Most people opt for a sporting clip where the hair is fairly short all over. Originally, the poodle's coats were corded, so they hung in long dreadlocks. This takes a lot of work and is difficult to wash, so the style has fallen out of favor. Shedding is below average. No breed is actually hypoallergenic, but poodles may cause allergies in fewer people compared to other breeds. The eyes should be checked regularly for hair or lashes that may irritate their surface. Hair growing inside the ears may need to be plucked out or clipped. Poodles tend to stay in good weight. The thick coat can sometimes obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight Jogging Partner 2 out of 5 Lap Dog 4 out of 5 Good With Children 5 out of 5 Warm Weather 3 out of 5 Cold Weather 3 out of 5 Grooming Requirements 5 out of 5 Shedding 1 out of 5 Barking 3 out of 5 Ease Of Training 5 out of 5 About Us Contact Us Find a Hospital Location Directory Press Center Social Responsibility Career Opportunities Opens in New Window Grow Your Hospital Sitemap Opens in New Window Opens in New Window Opens in New Window Opens in New Window"

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Standard Schnauzer The standard schnauzer originated in Germany in the Middle Ages. Even by the 1300s it was appreciated as a vermin hunter and all-around farm dog and guardian. It was probably derived from crosses of wire-haired pinschers, German poodles and some sort of spitz breed. It is not related to the British terriers. The first recorded reference to the dogs being called schnauzers was in 1842. The name is thought to be derived from the German words for nose or beard. The breed was initially called a wire-haired pinscher when it was first exhibited at a dog show in 1879. By 1900, it was a popular dog show contender. Most standard schnauzers continued to be used for work, however. By the early 1900s, they were the most popular dogs for guarding farmers' carts when they took them to market. The first records of schnauzers in America come from around 1900. The AKC recognized the standard schnauzer in 1904. At that time the breed was classified as a terrier. The standard schnauzer is the original of the three Schnauzer breeds that the AKC recognizes. The miniature was recognized separately in 1926, and the giant in 1930. During World War I, standard schnauzers were used as guard dogs. They have been used by both German and American police departments for use as police dogs and contraband detection dogs. Despite being the original schnauzer, the standard is the least popular of the three schnauzer breeds in America. Makes a loyal and fun companion, as well as an excellent guardian. Playful and good with children. Bold, watchful, busy and often mischievous. Tends to be aloof toward strangers. Can be aggressive toward strange dogs. Usually gets along with household pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Learns quickly, but also bores quickly, and can be quite headstrong. Makes a lively and alert housedog, but can be mischievous unless given enough exercise. Its exercise needs can be met with a long walk or run, along with a vigorous game. Standard schnauzers may not do well at dog parks, but it depends on the individual dog. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Coat is hard and wiry, longer on the legs, muzzle, and eyebrows. The coat needs combing once or twice weekly. Many pet owners elect to have their dogs professionally groomed, or clipped into a trim that is more easily cared for. This must be repeated every two to three months. Show dogs must have their coat plucked and stripped. Shedding is below average. Standard schnauzers tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Chesapeake Bay Retriever In 1807, an English ship foundered off the coast of Maryland. Its crew and cargo were rescued, and in gratitude, the crew gave their rescuers two puppies that were presumably Newfoundlands of the time. These dogs grew to be talented water retrievers, and as such, their offspring were sought after. Many types of dogs were bred with them, and eventually a distinct type of dog emerged. They were a hardy retriever that could mark the fall of many ducks or geese and swim repeatedly through chilled rough water to retrieve all of them. By the mid to late 1800s, the breed had developed a reputation for its retrieving skills. It was called by several names, including the Chesapeake Bay duck dog, Newfoundland duck dog, and brown Winchester. The AKC recognized the breed in 1878. In the 1930s, the Chessie was the most popular retriever in America. In 1964, the Chesapeake Bay retriever became he official dog of Maryland. Makes an adventurous and loyal companion. Playful and generally good with children. Eager to please, but can be oblivious to corrections. More independent than other retrievers. More protective than other retrievers. Aloof toward strangers. Gets along fairly well with other pets and dogs. Loves to retrieve, to the point of seeming compulsive. Loves to swim. Quick to learn, but can be stubborn. Does best with reward-based training involving food or retrieving. Can be a calm housedog if given adequate exercise. Needs daily walks, jogs, hikes or play sessions. Swimming and retrieving are favored methods of exercise. Also needs mental exercise in the form of training or games. Chessies enjoy hunting, and many owners compete in field events with them. Coat is made up of a dense wooly undercoat with a harsh, wavy and oily outer coat. The oiliness makes the coat waterproof. Bathing removes the oil, so is not recommended before cold weather hunting that may require swimming. Brushing once a week is adequate; more during shedding seasons. Shedding is average. Chessies have a tendency to become overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet that does not allow them to become overweight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Whippet The whippet descends from greyhound roots, probably mixed with ratting terriers. The resulting small dogs could be used for poaching in the royal forests, and for entertainment in snap dog contests in which bets were made on how many rabbits a dog could snap up before the rabbits escaped from a circle. This gave the whippet its first name of ""snap-dog."" During the Industrial Revolution, workers brought their dogs with them to towns. They staged betting races in which the dogs raced in a 200-yard straight line toward a person waving a rag. This earned the breed the name of ""poor man's racehorse."" The AKC recognized the whippet in 1888. The whippet is the most popular of the greyhound-like breeds. The whippet is the most successful breed competing in the sport of lure-coursing, in which they chase a plastic bag dragged along a zig-zagging course at high speed. Makes a devoted and gentle companion. It is one of the most demonstrative and obedient of the greyhound-like breeds. It enjoys sitting close to its family; it is sometimes described as ""clingy."" It may tend to run off to chase moving things, especially small animals. Sociable with children, strangers, and other dogs and animals (except small strange ones running away). An alert watchdog, but not a very effective protection dog. Learns quickly, but is easily bored. Does best with reward-based training involving food or play. Very sensitive. Makes a very quiet housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a moderate walk or jog, or a sprint in an enclosed area, every day. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its short hair provides virtually no protection against cold weather. A coat may be necessary in cold weather. Coat is short and thin. The coat needs weekly brushing, and occasional bathing. Shedding is below average. Whippet conformation is for a naturally thin build, but owners often overfeed them. You should be able to feel the ribs, but they should not be too noticeable. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Jack Russell Terrier Also known as Parson Russell terrier. The Parson John Russell developed the breed that bears his name. He was a foxhunting enthusiast who wanted a good terrier to run with the hound pack and to dispatch the fox at the end of the hunt. A milkman gave him a dog named Trump, which suited his purpose and became the dog the breed was modeled after. Aside from Trump, nobody knows what dogs he used to create his breed. In fact, Jack Russell terrier proponents long considered the dogs a strain, rather than a breed, meaning they could mix in another dog for effect occasionally. The Parson devoted his life to his dogs and to foxhunting. Although he judged other breeds at dog shows, he never once exhibited his own dogs. This is one reason Jack Russell terriers were not shown in dog shows until fairly recently. In the early 1900s, some Jack Russell terriers began to appear with very short legs. This eventually caused a heated debate between fanciers who preferred the traditional long legged terriers and those who preferred the shorter legged ones. In England, the longer legged ones were known as Parson Jack Russell terriers. Shorter legged Jack Russell terriers are extremely popular among many of the horse set. In America, many breed fanciers fought against AKC recognition, but the AKC recognized the Jack Russell terrier in 2000. To this day, many Jack Russell terriers are registered with the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA) rather then the AKC. The AKC later changed the breed name to Parson Russell terrier, emphasizing that these are the longer legged dogs. Most people still know them as Jack Russell terriers, however. Famous media Jack Russells include Moose - the dog who played Eddie on Frasier, and Wishbone. Makes an entertaining and adventurous companion, as well as an excellent watchdog. Playful and good with children. Needs a lot of interaction. Bold, watchful, busy, independent and mischievous. Friendly toward strangers. Can be scrappy with other dogs. May not be good with small pets, especially rodents. May not come when call. Tends to run off in search of adventure or animals. May go into underground dens in search of game. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Learns quickly, but also bores quickly, and may come up with its own ideas. Some tend to bark a lot, which should be discouraged from an early age. Some tend to dig a lot. Obedience training is essential. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Its exercise needs can be met with a long walk or run, along with several vigorous games. They also need a chance to sniff and explore in a safe place or on leash. Without sufficient mental and physical exercise, this breed can be destructive and disobedient. Jack Russells tend to enjoy dog parks, and most do well in them as long as they are not allowed to bully other dogs. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Agility is a favored sport. Coat can be either smooth or broken. The smooth coat is flat and hard. The broken coat is harsh, straight and close-lying. Both coat types need weekly brushing to remove dead hair. The broken coat may need stripping of long dead hair. Shedding is average. Jack Russell terriers tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/end-life-care,End of Life Care,aspca.org,unknown,general,"End of Life Care. Skip to content Coping with the impending loss of a pet is one of the most difficult experiences a pet parent will face. Whether your furry friend is approaching his golden years or has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, it’s important to calmly guide the end-of-life experience and minimize any discomfort or distress. As your pet’s health declines, you may elect to care for your pet at home—with the supervision of a veterinarian—or you may decide to end his suffering with euthanasia. Read on to find out how to help make your pet’s final days peaceful and dignified. Is Your Pet In Pain? When cats and dogs are suffering, they may not show outward signs that we normally associate with pain like whimpering or crying. Sometimes an animal will continue to eat or drink in spite of pain or disorientation. Some physiological and behavioral signs that your pet might be experiencing pain include excessive panting or gasping for breath, reclusiveness, reluctance to move and food pickiness. Caring for an Elderly Pet The most important thing you can do for your elderly pet is to minimize any pain or distress she’s experiencing. Pet Hospice Care Pet hospice care, also known as palliative care, is an option if your pet is suffering from a terminal illness and a cure is not possible. The goal is to make a pet’s final days or weeks more pleasant with the proper use of pain medications, dietary strategies and human interaction. Pet hospice is not a place, but a personal choice and philosophy based on the principle that death is a part of life and can be dignified. When considering hospice care, pet parents should very careful not to prolong the suffering of pets who are in pain or experiencing poor quality of life. A participating veterinarian will teach pet parents how to provide intensive home care to keep an ill pet as comfortable as possible. Hospice care requires an active commitment and constant supervision from pet parents, who work with their veterinary team to make sure their pet’s life ends comfortably. If you decide hospice care is the right course for you and your pet, you will become your pet’s primary nurse and caregiver, as well as the link between your pet and the veterinary team. Consult with your primary veterinarian and see if she recommends hospice care for your pet based on his specific needs. Considering Euthanasia Euthanasia provides a painless, peaceful end for a pet who would otherwise continue to suffer. Your veterinarian has special training to provide your pet with a humane and gentle death. During the procedure, your vet will inject your pet with a sedative followed by a special medication. The animal experiences no awareness of the end of life—the process is akin to undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure and takes about 10 to 20 seconds. Your veterinarian is the best person to advise you on when the time is right to euthanize—information from medical tests is often more accurate than what a pet owner can observe, and pet owners often delay the moment of euthanasia in anticipation of grief. Observing and keeping an accurate record of your pet in his daily activities can help you to decide. If you observe that moments of discomfort outweigh his capacity to enjoy life, it is time to euthanize, even if your pet still experiences pleasure in eating or socializing. If your pet is in pain, your main goal should be to minimize his suffering. What to Do If Your Pet Has Died at Home If your pet is under the care of a veterinarian at the time of his or her passing, he or she can guide you through next steps. However, if your pet dies in your home, there are options to consider. Whether you simply want the body to be removed from your home, or you wish to permanently memorialize your pet in some special way, the choice is yours. Pet Cremation and Burial It is very common for pet owners to have their deceased pets cremated. You need to decide if you wish to keep your pet's ashes as a remembrance. If so, you will want to arrange an individual (or private) cremation, meaning that your pet will be cremated alone. Businesses that offer individual cremation commonly offer home pick-up/delivery of remains as part of their service packages. Depending on local laws, it may be legal to bury an animal on your own property. It is typically illegal to bury an animal on public lands such as parks. If you desire burial for your pet but do not have land of your own, check to see if there is a pet cemetery or memorial park in your area. Other Options If you wish to simply have your pet’s body removed from your home, consult your local government to find out if your sanitation department picks up animal remains. Dealing with Pet Loss There are many forms of grief that are completely normal in the wake of the loss of a beloved pet. It can help to memorialize your pet in a way that includes others who cared about him or her. Friends and family can help form a support network. If severe symptoms of grief persist, it is best to consult with your doctor about your feelings and ways to cope with this loss.

Surround her with her favorite things, like a warm blanket or special squeaky toy. Since pressure sores can develop in pets with limited mobility, it’s also essential to provide a warm sleeping spot with plenty of cushioning. Some older pets may develop incontinence, or the loss of bladder control, so be sure to check your furry friend regularly for any wetness or soiling. If your pet needs help getting up to urinate or defecate, you can purchase a sling or use a large towel to wrap under her body and assist her. Depending on your decision, you may have to keep the body in your home for a short period of time. A well-cooled body can be held for up to 24 hours, but the sooner it can be taken somewhere else, the better. Placing the wrapped animal in a refrigerator or freezer is recommended, with one exception—if you plan to have a necropsy (autopsy) performed to determine cause of death, the body should not be frozen (refrigeration is still okay). It is essential that you contact a veterinarian as soon as possible if you would like a necropsy. If the animal is too big to be put into a refrigerator or freezer, the body should be placed on a cement floor or concrete slab, which is the best way to draw heat away from the carcass. Do not cover or wrap the body in this instance. Doing so will trap in heat and not allow the body temperature to cool. As a last resort, you may keep the body in the coldest area of your home, out of the sun, packed with bags of ice. In this case, the body should be placed in a plastic bag to prevent it from getting wet.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds American Staffordshire Terrier In ancient times, Romans developed several breeds for the purpose of gladiator sports. Later, a descendent of these dogs, the bullenbeisser, was valued by butchers for its ability to control unruly cattle by catching and gripping bulls on their way to market. Butchers began to hold contests to see who had the best bull dogs, and the contests evolved into cruel bull baiting events that often lasted for hours. The practice of bull baiting and other blood sports was outlawed in England around 1835. Owners of dogs instead staged clandestine events inside, where they couldn't be caught, and pitted one dog against another. Dog fighting favored a smaller, more agile dog, and the bull dogs were crossed with terriers to create the bull and terrier for that purpose. The dogs gradually became to be known as pit bulldogs, then pit bulls. Pit bulls came to America by the mid-1800s, where they were used for fighting as well as all-purpose farm dogs. AKC would not register pit bulls because they felt to do so would be to endorse dog fighting. The United Kennel Club was formed in 1898 to register pit bulls, which it continues to register now as American pit bull terriers. The UKC now registers many breeds. The American Dog Breeder's Association was formed in 1909 to register only pit bulls. In 1936, the AKC accepted pit bulls under the name Staffordshire terrier (changed to American Staffordshire terrier in 1972). In the early 1900s, pit bulls became a symbol of American spirit. A pit bull named Stubby was a national war hero, and Petey of Our Gang was very popular. In the 1980s pit bulls became popular as tough dogs, with people encouraging crosses to more aggressive breeds to create pit bull mixes for guarding and fighting. Pit bulls were associated with many dog attacks, some fatal, and have since then been the target of breed specific legislation. Most pit bulls continue to live as peaceful family members. They are the most popular breed registered by the UKC, and overall, one of the most popular breeds in America. Makes a loyal and fun-loving companion. Playful and generally good with children, but may be overly protective of them. As with any large dog, they should be supervised when around children. Fairly friendly toward strangers. Early socialization is essential. Not friendly towards strange dogs, and may not be good with small pets. The pit bull learns quickly, but can be stubborn. It tends to rebel against forceful methods. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Training is essential to combat the negative image the public tends to have of the breed. Makes a calm and alert housedog as long as it receives regular exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, short jog, or energetic games. It is not a good candidate for dog parks because if it does become involved in a fight---which can break out at any gathering of dogs---it tends not to lose. The pit bull enjoys cold weather outings but its short coat is not suited to living outside. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Weight pulling is a favorite sport. Coat is short, close and glossy. The coat needs only occasional brushing, once every week or so, to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Pit bulls tend to stay in good weight or tend to be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Cockapoo In the 1940s, both Cocker spaniels and poodles were among the most popular breeds in America. It was inevitable that individuals from the two breeds mate. As the progeny from these litters proved themselves to be attractive and amiable companions, more people decided to purposefully mate Cocker spaniels and poodles. The first record of Cockapoos dates to the 1950s. By the 1960s, Cockapoos had developed a following and many people went out of their way to add a Cockapoo to their family in preference to a purebred dog. Most Cockapoos are the result of breeding an American Cocker spaniel to a poodle. Those from English Cocker spaniels are called English Cockapoos. The Poodle parent is usually a miniature or toy variety, seldom standard. The Cockapoo Club of America was founded in 1998. Another club, the American Cockapoo Club, also registers Cockapoos. With the popularity of designer hybrid dogs in the 2000s, the Cockapoo has found a new group of admirers. The Cockapoo does not meet the AKC's criteria for recognition because they are not a pure breed. However, they are more popular than many of AKC's rarer breeds. Makes an exuberant and entertaining companion. Usually very good with children. A happy dog, not easily bothered by things. Eager to please and quick to learn, but can be overly excitable and easily distracted. Does best with reward-based training involving food and games. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Enjoys retrieving. Usually enjoys swimming. Some bark a lot. Makes a fairly calm housedog if given adequate exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, jog, or energetic games. A good candidate for dog parks. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is fairly long and wavy; silkier than a poodle's coat. The coat needs brushing and combing two to three times a week to prevent mats. Professional grooming and clipping is required about every six weeks. Special attention should be paid to keeping the eyes clean and clear of stray hairs. The ears must be checked weekly for problems. Shedding is below average. Although no breed is non-allergenic, the Cockapoo may cause fewer allergies in people compared to other breeds. Cockapoos have a tendency to become overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a balanced a puppy food.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Labrador Retriever Despite their name, they originated in Newfoundland, not Labrador. Developed from the ""Lesser"" Newfoundland-a medium-sized black dog that retrieved game and fish from cold waters, and even pulled small boats. Although they died out in Newfoundland, the Labs we see today are descended from those that were taken to England in the early 1800s. In England, they gained favor as upland game retrievers; by 1870, the name Labrador Retriever was common in England. Two Labs of the 1880s, Buccleuch Avon and Ned, are widely considered to be the ancestors of all modern Labs. In 1892, the first liver Labs were officially recorded, and in 1899, the first yellow Lab. However, yellow and chocolate dogs did exist before then. Labs came to America as Scottish-style shooting and gamekeeping became prestigious among upper class sportsmen. The breed was recognized by the English Kennel Club in 1903, and the AKC in 1917. In 1938, a Lab became the first dog to appear on the cover of Life magazine, bringing the breed national attention. The Lab was also the first dog to be featured on a U.S. stamp, in 1959. Labs gradually replaced other breeds as the most popular guide dogs. They are also popular search and rescue dogs, assistance dogs and contraband detection dogs. Since 1991, the Labrador Retriever has been the most popular breed in America. It is also the most popular breed in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. U.S. President Bill Clinton owned a Labrador named Buddy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin owned a Labrador named Koni. Makes a playful and trustworthy child's companion. Eager to please, but can be oblivious to corrections. A happy dog, with a good old boy attitude; not easily bothered. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Loves to retrieve, to the point of seeming compulsive. Loves to swim. Quick to learn, but tends to pull when on leash. Does best with reward-based training involving food or retrieving. Can be a calm housedog if given adequate exercise. Needs daily walks, jogs, hikes or play sessions. Swimming and retrieving are favored methods of exercise. Also needs mental exercise in the form of training or games. Field-bred Labs are lighter built and more active than show-bred Labs, and will usually require more exercise. Labs enjoy hunting, and many owners compete in field events with them. Coat is straight and thick, but fairly short. Colors are black, yellow and chocolate. No other colors are considered acceptable. Brushing once a week is adequate; more during shedding seasons. Shedding is average to above average. Labradors have a tendency to become obese. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet that does not allow them to become overweight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This has been shown to decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds American Cocker Spaniel Spaniels were developed at least by the 1300s to flush birds into nets or to waiting falcons. Later, they were also used to find and point birds and were specialized by their size, terrain, and type of bird. The Cocker Spaniel, which was used for woodcock, was first mentioned in 1790. Cocker Spaniels were in America by the late 1800s. The AKC recognized the Cocker Spaniel in 1878. The Cocker Spaniel was the most popular breed in America from 1936 to 1952. As the Cocker became known as a show dog, winning Cockers tended to be smaller, longer legged, and rounder headed than the original stock from England. In 1946, the AKC split the breed into English Cocker Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels. Only in America are these names used; elsewhere they are known as Cocker Spaniels and American Cocker Spaniels, respectively. Cockers were such a part of Americana that Cocker celebrities included Spot (of Dick and Jane ""See Spot Run"" fame), Cover Boy Butch (25 times a Saturday Evening Post cover model), Lady (Lady and the Tramp), and the Coppertone Cocker. Cocker Spaniels were once again the top breed in America from 1983 to 1990. The breed is divided into three varieties according to color: Black (solid black or black and tan); ASCOB (which stands for Any Solid Color Other than Black, and includes cream, red, brown, and brown and tan); and Particolor (spotted or roan). Makes an exuberant and entertaining companion. Usually very good with children. A happy dog, not easily bothered by things. Eager to please and quick to learn, but can be so excitable that it has difficulty minding. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Enjoys retrieving. Usually enjoys swimming. Some bark a lot. Some are overly submissive. Submissive urination is not uncommon. Makes a fairly calm housedog if given adequate exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, jog, or energetic games. A good candidate for dog parks. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is fairly long, silky, and either flat or wavy. The coat needs brushing and combing two to three times a week to prevent mats. Professional grooming and clipping is required once a month. Special attention should be paid to keeping the eyes clean and clear of stray hairs. The ears must be checked weekly for problems. Shedding is average. Cockers have a tendency to become overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a balanced a puppy food.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Alaskan Malamute The Alaskan Malamute was first described living amongst the Mahlemut people on Alaska's northwest coast. The dogs served as hunting partners for seals and polar bears, among other big game, and as sled dogs for hauling heavy loads. The dogs were an integral part of these people's survival, and were valued both as workers and tribal members. In 1896, the discovery of gold sparked the gold rush, and with it an influx of outsiders who immediately realized the value of good sled dogs both as workers and entertainment. They staged weight pulling contests and races among their dogs. They crossed the native Alaskan breeds with each other and with dogs they brought in, to the point that the true Malamute was in danger of being lost through interbreeding. In the 1920s, a New England dog racing enthusiast gathered up the best Malamute representatives he could find and began to promote the traditional Malamute. Malamutes were chosen to assist Admiral Byrd on his trek to the South Pole in 1933. The AKC recognized the breed in 1935. In World War II Malamutes were used to haul supplies and even act as search and rescue dogs. Malamutes are still valued as the exemplary breed for moving heavy loads in snow. They are strong, rather than swift, sled dogs. Makes a loyal and bold companion. It loves to run, pull, and roam, and must be confined in a secure yard. It is sociable toward people, but can be aggressive toward strange dogs or animals. Strong willed and independent, so that it needs training with a firm hand from a young age. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. It tends to dig and howl. Makes a fairly quiet housedog as long as its high exercise needs are met. Requires a very long walk or jog, or a long run in an enclosed area, every day. Particularly enjoys pulling sleds or heavy loads. Most Malamutes should not be let off leash unless the area is securely fenced. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. In cold weather it may prefer to stay outside. In warm weather it is usually happier inside. Its thick coat provides good protection against cold weather. Coat is made up of a soft thick undercoat covered by a straight, harsh outer coat that stands off from the body. The coat needs weekly brushing---more when shedding Shedding is above average. Malamutes tend to stay in good weight. The thick coat can obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Chihuahua Long The Chihuahua very likely descends from a combination of an ancient Central and South American dog called the Techichi, and Chinese dogs brought to Central America by the Spanish Conquistadors in the 1600s. Evidence exists of tiny dogs in Central America at the time of the Conquistadors. Following that time, there is a 300 year gap before the next recorded mention of them, when three tiny dogs were discovered in Chihuahua, Mexico in 1850. Origin of the two coat varieties is controversial, with some reports that the earliest discovered Chihuahuas were actually long coats. In fact, the Techichi may have had a moderately long coat. Other theories contend that the long coated variety came from crosses to the Papillon, Maltese, or Yorkshire Terrier once the breed came to the attention of American fanciers. The AKC recognized the breed in 1904. The first registered Chihuahua was a smooth coat, and the smooth coat has remained the more well-known variety. The Chihuahua is considered to be one breed with two varieties, which means that they compete in separate classes at dog shows but can be interbred with one another. The long coat results when a dog has two recessive genes for long hair. Smooth Chihuahuas may have either one or two dominant genes for short hair. By 1964, the Chihuahua had become the third most popular breed in America, but still, most of them were smooth coats. The Chihuahua has consistently remained one of America's top breeds since then, currently ranking 11 th in AKC popularity. The long coat seems to be increasing in popularity slightly, although no statistics are kept on this. Makes both a devoted lap dog and saucy playmate. Fairly playful with family children, but children must be supervised because they could easily hurt such a small dog. Tends to be a one-person, or at most, one-family dog. Reserved toward strangers. Early socialization so that it willingly accepts new people is important. Good with other dogs and pets, but can foolishly challenge larger strange dogs. Some can be overly bold, while others can be overly timid. Learns quickly, but tends to have a stubborn streak. Does not do well with force-based training methods, but is very good with reward-based training involving food. Housetraining can be more challenging than with many other breeds. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Although many of its physical exercise needs can be met with indoor games, it still needs the mental stimulation of walking and sniffing outdoors. A walk around the block once or twice daily will meet its outdoor needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many Chihuahuas can be trained to use indoor potty systems. Dog parks are not generally a good idea unless only small dogs are allowed together. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Excursions in a doggy purse can provide supplemental entertainment. Chihuahuas can swim, but most aren't crazy about it. They can, however, use a kiddy pool as a swimming pool. Chihuahuas, even long coated Chihuahuas, hate the cold. Because of their small size, they lose body heat rapidly. The coat has little undercoat, so it does not store heat well. Coat is soft and either straight or wavy, with fringed ears. Brushing two to three times a week will prevent tangles and mats. Shedding is average. The breed is prone to periodontal problems, which can be prevented in large part by regular tooth brushing. Chihuahuas have a tendency to become obese, which may go unnoticed under the long coat. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Remember, it does not take much food to feed such a small dog, and small snacks can easily add too many calories. Chihuahua puppies should be fed often to prevent hypoglycemia, a serious condition to which very small puppies are prone. Frequent small meals of high protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates may help guard against this condition.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Newfoundland The Newfoundland was developed on the coast of Newfoundland in the1700s. The breed's origins are unknown, but they seem to trace back to the 1662 settlement of the Roougnoust colony. The settlers are said to have included Great Pyrenees dogs. These dogs were bred with black English retrievers and possibly some husky-type dogs. The result was a large water-loving dog that was resilient to freezing weather and water. The dogs were all-purpose water dogs, hauling nets through the water, and even saving people who fell in. On land, they served as draft dogs and pack animals. By the late 1700s, they were called Newfoundlands. They came in solid black and in black and white; the latter were dubbed Landseers in 1779, named after the prominent artist who painted them. European visitors took specimens back to England, where they entered the show ring. At the same time, numbers dropped in Newfoundland. Eventually, Canadian and American breeders had to replenish their stock with Newfoundlands brought back from England. The AKC recognized the Newfoundland in 1886. World War II decimated the breed in England. This time, the American dogs had to replenish the European stock. The Newfoundland quickly regained numbers. It remains one of the more popular giant breeds. Makes a devoted and sweet companion. Patient and good with children. As with all large dogs, dogs and children should always be supervised. Very affectionate. Very friendly toward strangers. Friendly toward strange dogs. Good with other pets. Learns quickly and is willing to please. Sensitive. Does best with reward-based training with food rewards. Makes a calm and well-mannered housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a moderate walk or short jog. The Newfoundland enjoys cold weather, but doesn't do well in warm weather. Swimming is a favorite exercise. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat consists of a soft dense undercoat and a coarse, moderately long, straight outer coat. The coat needs only occasional brushing, once or twice every week, more often when shedding. Shedding is above average. Be prepared for drool. Newfoundlands tend to stay in good weight or be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

standard schnauzers with affenpinschers, miniature pinschers, poodles and possibly fox terriers and Scottish terriers. Some accounts even include the Pomeranian. They were developed in Germany in the late 1800s. The breed was developed as a small farm dog and ratter. The schnauzer is the only terrier not originating from European Isle stock. The earliest record of a miniature schnauzer is from 1888. The earliest record of one being exhibited in a dog show is from 1899. The name schnauzer comes from the German word, schnauze, meaning snout, possibly because of the heavy whiskers. The first miniature schnauzers came to America in 1924. The standard and miniature schnauzer were at first considered variants of the same breed, and were shown together at early dog shows. They were divided into separate breeds in 1899 in Germany, and in 1926 in America. After World War II, miniature schnauzers began to grow in popularity, eventually peaking as America's 3 rd most popular breed. Makes a loyal and fun companion, as well as an excellent watchdog. Playful and good with children. Bold, watchful, busy, and often mischievous. Takes a second to get to know strangers, but is then quite friendly. Most get along well with other dogs. Gets along with other pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Learns quickly, but also bores quickly, and may come up with its own ideas. Some tend to bark a lot, which should be discouraged from an early age. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Its exercise needs can be met with a long walk or short run, along with a vigorous game. They also need a chance to sniff and explore in a safe place or on leash. Miniature schnauzers tend to enjoy and do well at dog parks. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Coat is hard and wiry, longer on the legs, muzzle, and eyebrows. The coat needs combing once or twice weekly. Many pet owners elect to have their dogs professionally groomed, or clipped into a trim that is more easily cared for. This must be repeated every other month. Show dogs must have their coat plucked and stripped. Shedding is below average. Miniature schnauzers tend to stay in good weight or to be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Afghan Hound DNA studies have shown that the Afghan hound is one of the oldest breeds still in existence. Afghan hounds originated in Afghanistan, where they were used by nomadic tribes to chase down hare and gazelle over rocky mountainous terrain. They are extremely agile and excellent jumpers, as well as being extremely fleet. The first Afghan hounds came to England in the early 1900s. At the time they were called Barukhzy hounds. A particularly striking dog named Zardin was used as the model for the standard of perfection. The breed became known as one of the most glamorous of dogs, and was often seen with celebrities. In the 1970s, the Afghan became very popular as a status dog. The breed's popularity has since fallen so that it is now unusual to see one outside of the show ring. Makes a loyal, gentle, but independent companion. Can be clownish and playful, but its independent nature may make play frustrating for children. It is not a retriever at heart, but does like to chase and run. It is inclined to run off and is not very good at coming when called. It loves to hunt and chase small animals outdoors. It is good with indoor pets, including cats, however. A one family dog, tending to be aloof toward strangers. Adequate watchdog but poor protection dog. Learns quickly, but is easily bored. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Makes a quiet housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a long walk or jog, or a run in an enclosed area, every day. Most Afghans should not be let off leash unless the area is securely fenced. A few games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its long coat provides good protection against cold weather. Coat is long and soft. Some coats (called ""cotton coats"") tend to mat more than others. The coat needs brushing and combing every two to three days---daily when the puppy coat is being shed. Weekly bathing will reduce tangling. Neutered and spayed dogs tend to lose the breed's characteristic saddle, the area of short hair along the backline. Shedding is below average. Afghans are naturally very thin. Their conformation is such that even in good weight their hip bones are prominent. Feel under the coat to make sure they are not too thin. You should be able to feel the ribs, but they should not be too noticeable. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/horse-care,Horse Care,aspca.org,unknown,general,"Horse Care. Skip to content Are you bringing an equine friend into your family, or looking to brush up on your horse care skills? Read on for tips to keep your horse healthy and happy. A horse’s digestive system is designed to digest frequent, small meals of roughage throughout the day. The basic diet for most horses should be grass and good-quality hay, free of dust and mold. Clean, unfrozen water should be available at all times along with a trace mineral/salt block. How Much Food is Enough? Ideally, a horse will have constant access to high-quality forage in the form of fresh grass or hay. An empty stomach lends itself to a higher risk of ulcers and other digestive issues. How much to feed depends on various factors such as condition and activity level, but most horses should eat between 2% and 2.5% of their body weight in pounds of hay and supplemented feeds daily. It is important to watch your horse and make sure he is maintaining an appropriate weight. Your veterinarian can help you decide how to feed to keep your horse fit and healthy. All horses need vaccinations and regular deworming. Vaccination recommendations vary based on age, the amount the horse travels and location, so it is best to consult with your veterinarian. To get a general idea of what vaccines you should expect to give your horse, visit the American Association of Equine Practitioner’s vaccination guidelines . Worms can cause weight loss, poor coat and colic. It is best to have your veterinarian perform a fecal egg count test and advise you on which dewormers to use throughout the year. It is equally important to minimize your horse’s exposure to parasites. Proper management entails not putting too many horses on too little land, rotating pastures if possible, and removing manure regularly. Horses are social animals who are physiologically most sound when they have the ability to roam and interact with other horses. Of course, not all horses thrive in 24/7 turnout and not all horse owners have access to large areas of land. If your horse is stalled, be mindful of providing him socialization and enrichment opportunities , and provide daily turnout if possible. If your horse does live outside, make sure he has access to a safe shelter at all times. Horses can go into a light sleep with their legs “locked” so that it takes very little effort to remain standing. In order to achieve deep (REM or “dreaming”) sleep, a horse must lie flat. It is not known how much or how often a horse needs to do this, but do take note of any changes in your horse’s sleeping patterns. Horses were born to move. In the wild they may walk many miles in a day, sometimes trot, but rarely gallop unless they have to. Daily opportunity to exercise is a must, but if you are building up your horse’s strength and conditioning, follow a sensible plan and do it gradually. Unless it is very wet and windy, horses tolerate cold much better than heat and humidity. On hot and humid days, it is important to provide your horse with plenty of fresh water, minerals and access to adequate shade. In extreme heat, use caution and limit forced exercise. Likewise, during extreme cold weather, make sure your horse has access to shelter and the ability to protect himself from moisture and wind. Some horses may require a waterproof blanket for additional warmth. Hooves should be trimmed every six to eight weeks. Depending on your horse’s activity level, the environment and his body type, your horse may need shoes. Your farrier will be able to recommend the best course of action to keep your horse’s hooves strong and well-balanced. Horses’ teeth grow continuously. Uneven wear can lead to sharp points and edges that cause pain and difficulty chewing. A horse’s teeth should be checked once or twice a year and “floated” (filed to make them smoother) by a veterinarian. Dental problems, from painful points to rotting teeth, may cause difficulty chewing or “quidding,” which occurs when food falls out of the mouth. Other signs of dental disease may include foul breath, undigested hay in the stools or discomfort from the bit or noseband. Dental disease can lead to choke (esophageal blockage), colic and weight loss. Experts at the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center have compiled a list of toxic plants for horses . Check out the following list for a few of the more common toxic plants you might encounter. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, please call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center's 24-hour hotline at (888) 426-4435.

Less is often more and most horses, even active ones, only need several pounds of grain a day. Grains digest quickly, leaving the stomach empty and gasses in the intestines. Foals fed “high energy” diets can develop bone and joint problems. Some adult horses with certain muscle disorders can have their symptoms exacerbated by the high carbohydrates found in grain. Any changes to your horse’s diet should be made gradually to avoid colic (abdominal pain usually associated with intestinal disease) or laminitis (painful inflammation in the hoof associated with separation of the hoof bone from the hoof wall), either of which can be catastrophic. A horse or pony breaking into the grain bin or being allowed to gorge on green pasture for the first time since the fall could be headed for disaster. If you travel with your horse, bring his food along to avoid changes.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Pembroke Welsh Corgi It may not look like it at first glance, but breed historians contend the corgi descends from the spitz family of dogs. This family is characterized by small pointed ears, pointed muzzle, thick fur, and a bushy tail. The corgi is a dwarfed version, likely related to the Swedish valhund or Norwegian buhund. The name Corgi may be derived from the Welsh ""cor"" (dwarf, or sometimes, to gather) and ""ci"" (dog), although it could also be derived from the word for cur. A Welsh cattle dog was mentioned as early as the 1100s, although it's not know if that was a type of corgi. They were well-documented by the 1800s. Corgis were used to drive cattle, gather flocks of geese and chickens, herd sheep and ponies, and to guard the farm. Their short stature and nimble action enabled them to duck beneath the kicking hooves of cattle. As a working dog, they were passed over in the early days of dog showing. Only in 1926 did they enter the show ring in England. At first, Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh corgis were shown as the same breed, despite the fact that the two were almost certainly derived from different stock. In 1933, Princess Elizabeth acquired her first Pembroke corgi, drawing attention to the breed. Her Corgis remain the most well-known Corgis in the world. The first corgis came to America in the early 1930s. The AKC recognized the Pembroke in 1934. By the 1960s, the Pembroke was one of the most popular dogs around the world, and especially in Britain. Its popularity has since waned somewhat, but it still has many followers. Makes a biddable and fun-loving family member. Gentle and playful with children. When excited, many tend to nip at heels in play. Moderately outgoing toward strangers. Good with other dogs and pets. Willing to please, learns quickly. Does best with reward-based training using food or play. Some can bark a lot. Makes a fairly calm and alert housedog if given adequate exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk or short run. Vigorous games are also helpful. A well-fenced yard is essential. Herding is the favored exercise. This is not a breed for an inactive owner. Obedience training is essential for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is medium length and somewhat coarse. It requires brushing once a week to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Pembrokes have a tendency to be overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Irish Wolfhound The first mention of an Irish wolfhound is from Rome in 391 A.D. The breed gained fame as a gladiator of wild animals in the arena and as a hunter of large game. The combination of speed and strength made the dog the subject of many stories. The Irish name for the breed is Cu Faoil. Cu is a term implying bravery, and was once given to all large hounds. Irish chieftains favored the dogs for hunting the wolf and Irish elk. They also gave groups of them as traditional gifts to foreign nobility. The breed declined in number so that they were almost extinct in Ireland by 1800. The famine of 1845 almost ended the breed. In 1869, Captain G.A. Graham set about to reconstitute the breed by crossing the few remaining Irish Wolfhounds with other breeds such as the Scottish deerhound, Borzoi and Great Dane. The breed regained its numbers and became famous as the world's tallest dog. Makes a loyal and gentle companion. Its laidback nature may make play frustrating for children. It is not a retriever. Good with children, strangers, and other pets and dogs. It is unhurried when it comes to minding. It is not particularly good as either a watchdog or protection dog. It enjoys hunting and chasing wild animals. Obedience training is a must because of its size and strength. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Makes a very quiet housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a moderate walk or short jog, or a run in an enclosed area, every day. A few games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its harsh coat provides some protection against cold and wet weather. Coat is rough and harsh. The coat needs weekly brushing and occasional bathing. Dead hairs should be stripped from the coat twice a year. Shedding is below average. Calluses can form on the elbows and other pressure points, and can be difficult to cure. Irish wolfhound conformation is for a moderate build. You should be able to feel the ribs, but they should not be too noticeable. Puppies should be fed a large breed growth food so that they do not grow too fast. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Golden Retriever Developed in England along the Tweed River in the middle 1800s. Lord Tweedmouth wanted to create a dog with the strength to push through heavy cover, stamina to swim tirelessly, toughness to brave cold water, and gentleness to retrieve game unharmed. The original Goldens, then considered to be a yellow variety of Flat-Coated Retrievers, were a mixture of Wavy-Coated Retriever, Tweed Water Spaniel, setters, black retrievers, and even a Bloodhound. In England, the breed was originally recognized in 1903 as Flat Coats-Golden. In 1912 the name was changed to the Yellow or Golden Retriever. Although they were in America by 1900, the AKC did not recognize them until 1927. Goldens are among the most successful guide and assistance dogs. They also work in search and rescue. U.S. President Gerald Ford owned a Golden named Liberty. A Golden Retriever starred in the two Homeward Bound movies. The Golden Retriever has been one of the most popular breeds in America for decades. Makes a playful and trustworthy child's companion. Eager to please, but can be overly exuberant. A happy dog, not easily bothered by things. Does best with reward-based training involving food or retrieving. Its aptitude for learning, combined with its happy attitude and quick responses, make it one of the top breeds for obedience competition. Outgoing toward strangers. Gets along well with other pets and dogs. Loves to retrieve, to the point of seeming compulsive. Loves to swim. Makes a calm housedog, but only if given adequate exercise. Needs daily walks, jogs, hikes or play sessions. Swimming and retrieving are favored methods of exercise. Obedience training or other mental games are also important. Goldens enjoy hunting, and many owners compete in field events with them. Coat is straight or wavy, and dense. It is of medium to long length. Neutered or spayed individuals tend to have longer coats. Color varies from very light cream to dark mahogany. Brushing twice a week is adequate; more frequent brushing is necessary during shedding seasons. Shedding is average to above average. Goldens have a tendency to become overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate, but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Chinese Shar Pei Recent DNA studies indicate that the shar-pei is among the 14 most ancient breeds recognized by the AKC. Because it and the chow chow share a country of origin, are both ancient breeds and both have blue or black tongues, the two breeds probably share a similar origin. Some records indicate it was present in the southern provinces of China by 200 B.C., and even stronger evidence indicates that it was known by the 1200s. Much of the history of the breed has been lost. However, by the early 1900s the dogs were used by farmers as guard dogs, wild boar hunters, and for dog fighting. In 1968, the Hong Kong Kennel Club recognized them as a breed. In 1973, an article appearing in the American press named the shar-pei as the world's rarest dog. This sparked a flood of interest as western fanciers began efforts to save the breed. The AKC recognized the Chinese shar-pei in 1991. It is one of the most recognizable breeds in the world because of its abundant loose skin. Makes a devoted and protective family member. Generally tolerant of children, but may not be playful enough for them. Not overly demonstrative. Reserved toward, and even wary of, strangers. Not friendly towards strange dogs. Usually good with small family pets, but may chase livestock and other animals. Tends to be independent and stubborn. Rebels against forceful methods. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a calm and alert housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a leisurely walk, short jog, or quick game. It is not physically suited to overly vigorous exercise. Enjoys cold weather. Becomes overheated fairly easily. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. The shar-pei comes in two acceptable two coat types (horse and brush), and an additional coat type (bear) that is not acceptable. The horse coat is made up of short bristly hair, while the brush coat is slightly longer and softer. Both types should be harsh and stand off the skin. The bear coat is longer still. The wrinkles the breed is known for are most apparent in puppyhood. Some adult dogs continue to have loose skin all over their body into adulthood, whereas others retain it only on their head. The coat needs brushing every week to remove dead hair. Wrinkles should be examined regularly and if needed, cleaned, to prevent irritation. Shedding is average. Shar-peis tend to stay in good weight or to be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Scottish Terrier Scottish terriers were used by highland farmers to catch vermin. The history of the Scottish terrier is confused by the use of the term Scotch terrier to refer to any terrier from Scotland. Even with the advent of dog shows, the different terriers were shown together as Scotch terriers. In 1881 the Scotch terriers were divided into Dandie Dinmont and Skye terriers, with the present-day Scottish terriers in the Skye terrier group. By the end of that year the Skye terrier group was subdivided into Skye and hard-haired terriers, with Scotties in the latter. Eventually the hard-haired terriers were again divided into three breeds, which would be come the Scottish, West Highland white and Cairn terriers. For a time the breed was called the Aberdeen terrier, because of its popularity in that region. The first documented Scotty came to America in 1883. President Franklin Roosevelt had a Scotty named Fala, and Fala was largely responsible for the breed's soaring popularity after World War II. Fala was Roosevelt's constant companion, and is buried at his side. Scotties were a favorite image in advertising and fashion for many years. The breed remains one of the more popular and recognizable terriers. Makes a spirited and fun-loving companion. Playful and good with children. Fearless, clever, curious, and often mischievous. Fairly outgoing toward strangers. Feisty and sometimes argumentative around other dogs. May chase other household pets, but can learn to get along with cats. Rodents are a poor choice of housemate, however. Surprisingly sensitive. Independent and stubborn. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Learns quickly and is eager to please, but also bores quickly, and may come up with its own ideas. Many like to dig. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Its exercise needs can be met with a long walk or short run, along with a vigorous game. They also need a chance to sniff and explore in a safe place or on leash. They tend to go off hunting and may not come when called. Some Scotties do well at dog parks, while others don't. It depends on the individual dog's feistiness. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Coat is harsh and straight. The coat needs combing once or twice weekly. Shaping of the coat by plucking out dead hairs every three months is required to keep it tidy looking. Professional clipping makes coat maintenance easier. Shedding is below averag Scottish terriers tend to stay in good weight or be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Germany who needed a good guard dog to accompany him on his rounds. In the late 1800s he set about to create the ideal dog for his needs, combining a shepherd-type dog with a German pinscher, with later crosses to the black and tan Manchester terrier, greyhound, and weimaraner. By 1899 the breed had developed to the point that a breed club was formed. The first Doberman pinscher arrived in America in 1908. Dobermans gained favor as police, guard and military dogs, and their popularity grew following both World Wars. Dobermans were the second most popular breed in America in 1977. In some communities they have been the target of breed specific legislation. Makes a loyal and protective companion, an excellent guardian and watchdog. Playful and generally gentle with children. Tends to be reserved with strangers. Not very friendly towards strange dogs, and may not be good with small pets. Learns quickly, and enjoys mental challenges. It is actually quite sensitive, and does best with a firm but gentle owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Some owners train their dogs in Schutzhund, a sport that combines obedience, tracking, and protection. Dobermans are among the top obedience dogs in competition. Makes a calm yet alert housedog given adequate exercise. Otherwise it can be overactive and destructive. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, or preferably, long jog. Games and sprints can also help burn off energy. The Doberman enjoys cool weather for exercising but cannot live outside in it because of its short coat. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Agility training is an excellent way to challenge its mind and body. Coat is short, smooth and hard. The coat needs only occasional brushing, once every week or so, to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Dobermans tend to stay in good weight or be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Akita The Akita is the largest of seven native Japanese dog breeds. The modern akita is actually a recreation of that breed, restored using a combination of many breeds. The original akitas were used for big game hunting and for guarding. They were also used for dog fighting beginning in the 1600s, with crosses made to improve that ability. At that time they were called odate inu, or odate dog. In the late 1800s they began to be interbred with some foreign dogs that were brought into Japan. This influx of other genes threatened the breed's identity, as it lost many of its spitz characteristics. In the early 1900s a zoologist realized that the breed was in danger of being lost, and he worked to preserve it as a natural monument. In 1932, Hachiko gained fame for the breed as the faithful dog that waited for his master at the train station every day for the rest of his life, unaware that the man had died at work. In 1937, Helen Keller brought further fame to the breed when she selected one as her companion and brought it to America. It was the first akita in America. During World War II, most akitas were killed for fur or because of lack of food, or they were interbred with German shepherds, which were the only dogs allowed. After the war, only about 20 akitas were left in Japan. Most others were part German shepherd. The breed grew slowly, with fanciers making great strides to restore it to its earlier nature. The AKC recognized the akita in 1972. Makes a loyal and protective companion. Playful with children, but may mistake the play of visiting children as threats to family children. As with any large breed, dogs and children should be supervised. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent, bold and adventurous. A one family dog, tending to be aloof toward strangers. Early socialization so that it willingly accepts new people is important. Often aggressive toward other dogs and pets. Obedience training is a requirement for this breed. Learns quickly, but can be stubborn. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games, and an owner who can be a strong leader. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games, and an owner who can be a strong leader. Makes a trustworthy and alert housedog as long as its exercise needs are met. Requires a long walk or jog every day. Most akitas do not do well in dog parks. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thick coat provides good protection against cold weather but may make it prone to overheating. Coat is made up of a soft thick undercoat covered by a straight, harsh outer coat that stands off from the body. The coat needs weekly brushing weekly-more when shedding heavily. Shedding is above average. Akitas tend to stay in good weight. The thick coat can obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Old English Sheepdog The first picture that may be of an Old English sheepdog dates from 1771, although whether it is actually an OES is unknown. More evidence exists that the breed originated in the west of England in the 1800s. It was developed to fill the need for a strong dog that could both defend flocks and herds, and to drive them to market. It may have been derived from the bearded collie or Russian owtcharka. At that time there was a tax on many dogs. Working dogs, evidenced by their docked tails, were exempt. As a drover's dog, the OES had its tail docked, or ""bobbed,"" to avoid taxes. The tradition of tail docking persisted after the taxes were lifted. The OES is sometimes called the bobtail. By the early 1900s the breed was as popular, or more so, in the show ring as in the pasture. The AKC recognized the OES in 1905. In the 1970s, the OES became a popular media dog, appearing in movies and television. This helped spur its popularity as a pet for many years. Since that time its popularity has decreased gradually. Makes a gentle and entertaining companion. Devoted to and protective of its family. Good with children. Good with other dogs and pets. Does best with reward-based training involving games or food. Learns quickly, but can be headstrong. Makes a well-mannered housedog, given adequate exercise. It needs a moderate to long walk, or a good run or play session every day. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Enjoys cold weather, but cannot live permanently outside in it. Coat is long, hard and shaggy, with a thick waterproof undercoat. It needs brushing and combing every other day or thick mats will form. Shedding is average to below average. The long hair around the eyes is usually tied back for everyday life so that it doesn't interfere with vision. OESs tend to stay in good weight. Changes in weight can be difficult to notice under the thick coat, so you must feel at least weekly. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Boxer The Boxer descends from two types of German Bullenbeisers, or bull-biters. The Bullenbeisers were originally used to chase large game, such as boar, deer, and bear, through the forests, grabbing and hanging on until the hunter could arrive to dispatch it. In the early 1800s, German hunters tried to improve their hunting dogs by crossing their Bullenbeisers with mastiff-type dogs and with Bulldogs. The result was a strong, agile dog with strong jaws and a recessed nose to enable it to breathe while hanging on. By the late 1800s, these dogs were popular as butcher's dogs, controlling cattle in slaughter yards. The slaughter yard dogs were called Boxl, which may have been the origin of the name, Boxer. The Boxer was established by 1895. The Boxer was one of the first breeds used as a police and military dog. In 1904, the AKC recognized the Boxer. The breed remained relatively obscure in America until the 1940s, when it began its slow but steady rise. It eventually peaked at number 4, and remains in the top 10. Makes a loyal and protective companion. Playful and gentle with children. Fairly outgoing toward strangers. Generally good with other dogs, but some can be aggressive toward strange dogs. Generally good with other pets. Learns quickly, but can be both sensitive and stubborn. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a calm and alert housedog, but can be restless unless it receives adequate exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, jog or energetic games. The Boxer's short muzzle makes it intolerant of heat. The Boxer's short coat makes it intolerant of very cold weather. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Boxers compete in obedience and agility successfully. Coat is short and shiny. It needs only occasional brushing, once every week or so, to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Boxers tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Pug Pugs originated in China in ancient times. They were developed as lap dogs rather than as any sort of working dog. The facial wrinkles were an essential breed feature. The vertical forehead wrinkles were thought to resemble the Chinese mark for ""Prince."" Dutch traders brought pugs back from China with them, and Holland subsequently became the pug's adopted homeland. The pug became the official dog of the House of Orange because they sounded the alarm at the approach of invading soldiers in 1572. Napoleon's wife, Josephine, used her pug to carry messages back and forth when she was imprisoned. The pug became the most popular royal dog in England during Victorian times. The pug was known as Mopshond in Holland, as Mops in Germany, and as Dutch or Chinese pug in England. The AKC recognized the pug in 1885. The pug took a while to catch on in America, but it has a steady following and has been among the top 20 breeds for years. Makes a devoted and entertaining family member. Playful, affectionate and gentle with children, pugs make excellent companions for them. Known for its clownish behavior and sense of humor. Affectionate and demonstrative. Reserved toward strangers. Usually good with other dogs and pets. Willing to please but doesn't like to be forced, which brings out its stubborn streak. Does best with reward-based training with good control and leadership. Makes a calm and alert housedog. Requires daily exercise in the form of a leisurely walk, very short jog, or quick game. It is not physically suited to overly vigorous exercise. Overheats easily. Swimming is not recommended, as many pugs cannot stay afloat. Obedience and trick training provides essential mental exercise. The pug's coat is fine, smooth and short. The skin is overly abundant, and wrinkled on the face. The coat needs weekly brushing to remove dead hair. Wrinkles need regular cleaning and drying to prevent skin infections. Shedding is above average. Pugs have a tendency to become obese. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Bull Terrier Gladiator sports were considered prime entertainment for centuries in many parts of the world. Several of those blood sports, including bull and bear baiting, involved dogs. When these blood sports were outlawed in England in 1835, dog fighting became more popular to fill the void. Compared to bull and bear baiting dogs, dogs bred for fighting needed to be smaller and more agile. This was achieved by crossing the bull baiting dogs with terriers to create the bull and terrier breed. When dog fighting was in turn outlawed, many patrons of the bull and terrier breed decided to clean up the dog's image. They bred for amiable personality and stylish good looks, and even began to compete in dogs shows successfully. Around 1860, James Hinks crossed the bull and terrier with the White English terrier and the Dalmatian, producing an all-white strain he called the bull terrier. These dogs became sought after as stylish companions for young gentlemen. The bull terrier was nicknamed the ""white cavalier"" because of its chivalrous and brave nature. Around 1900, color was re-introduced into the breed by crossing them with Staffordshire bull terriers. In 1936 the breed was split into two varieties, the white and the colored bull terrier. Famous bull terriers include Spuds McKenzie and the Target dog. Bull terriers have sometimes been included in breed specific legislation because of confusion with pit bulls. Makes a loyal and fun-loving companion. Exuberantly comical and often mischievous. Playful and good with children. Fairly friendly toward strangers. Not very friendly towards strange dogs. Usually good with other pets. The bull terrier learns quickly, but can be stubborn. It tends to rebel against forceful methods. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Can sometimes exhibit compulsive behavior. Makes a calm and alert housedog as long as it receives regular exercise. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, short jog or energetic games. The bull terrier enjoys cold weather outings but its short coat is not suited to living outside. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is short, flat and harsh. The coat needs only occasional brushing, once every week or so, to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Bull terriers tend to stay in good weight or tend to be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds American Eskimo American Eskimo dogs descend from the ancient spitz family of dogs. In fact, this breed is the one many people think of when they think of a spitz. Typical of the spitz family, they have many features to combat cold weather, including a thick coat, small ears, and a bushy tail to warm the nose when curled up sleeping. They probably were developed from spitz-type dogs in Germany, with input from other spitz breeds such as the Pomeranian, Volpino Italiano, and Keeshond. In fact, it was the exclusion of white Keeshonden and oversize Pomeranians in the early 1900s that produced a population of dogs that probably played a large role in establishing the American Eskimo dog. These dogs were general farm dogs and watchdogs, and they often accompanied their owners to America. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1913 as the American spitz. In the 1920s, the breed gained fame as a circus dog, and many circuses sold puppies on the side. Old pedigrees included information on what tricks each ancestor could do. After World War I, the breed's name was changed to the less Germanic-sounding American Eskimo. The AKC did not recognize the breed in part because most people did not keep acceptable records attesting to their pure breeding. Once this was overcome, the AKC recognized them as the American Eskimo dog in 1994. Makes an amiable and energetic companion; an excellent watchdog. Playful and generally good with children. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent, bold and adventurous. A one family dog, tending to be aloof toward strangers. Early socialization so that it willingly accepts new people is important. Some can be unfriendly toward other dogs and pets. Learns quickly, but can be stubborn. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Some tend to bark a lot, which should be discouraged from an early age. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Larger Eskies require a good walk or run every day. Although many of the physical exercise needs of the toy variety can be met with indoor games, it still needs the mental stimulation of walking and sniffing outdoors. Most Eskies do well in dog parks. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thick coat provides good protection against cold weather but may make it prone to overheating. Coat is made up of a soft thick undercoat covered by a longer harsh outer coat. Brushing and combing twice weekly-more when shedding heavily-is necessary to prevent matting. The hair around the anus should be checked regularly for hygiene issues. Shedding is above average. Eskies tend to stay in good weight or to be slightly overweight. The thick coat can obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Toy Eskie puppies should be fed often to prevent hypoglycemia, a serious condition to which very small puppies are prone. Meals of high protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates may also help guard against this condition. This should not be a concern in larger varieties.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Border Collie The border collie originated in Britain around the English and Scottish border during the 1800s. A defining event was the advent of the first competitive sheepdog trial in 1873, in which a dog named Hemp made such a good showing that he became sought after for stud. Hemp is considered to be the father of the border collie. Hemp and his progeny herded not by nipping and barking, as was commonplace, but by staring and stalking (known as ""giving eye""). This intimidated the sheep into moving. Early border collies were selected only for working ability, and in fact, the first breed standard, drawn up in 1906, addressed only ability, not appearance. In 1915 the dogs, formerly referred to as sheepdogs, were named border collies. Many border collie enthusiasts fought against recognition by the AKC, but the AKC recognized the border collie in 1995. The majority of border collies, especially working ones, are not registered with the AKC. Makes an endlessly enthusiastic and energetic companion. Playful and very good with children Somewhat reserved with strangers Good with other dogs and pets. Does best with reward-based training involving games, food or praise. Learns quickly, but can become easily bored. Border collies enjoy learning new things. A border collie without a job to do or without mental stimulation can become frustrated and destructive. This is not a breed for a lazy person. Border collies from working lines tend to be more active than those from companion or show lines. Some may bark a lot. The border collie is a leading competitor in the sports of obedience, agility and herding. Makes an alert housedog. This is an extremely active and playful dog that enjoys having a job to do. It needs a long run or exercise period every day, plus some short play sessions. Does well in dog parks. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Herding is a favored activity. Agility, flyball and disk catching are also activities that exercise the mind and body, and that border collies enjoy. Border collies tolerate cold weather, but cannot live outside in it. Coat can be either smooth, where it is short all over the body; or rough, where it is medium to long in length; and flat to slightly wavy. Coat requires brushing once or twice weekly, depending on length. Shedding is average. Border collies tend to stay in good weight, or even be somewhat lean. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Alcohol is rapidly absorbed after ingestion, so it’s important to take prompt action in seeking veterinary attention if your pet has had exposure. Yeast dough can rise and cause gas to accumulate in your pet’s digestive system. This can be painful and cause the stomach to bloat, and potentially twist, becoming a life-threatening emergency. The yeast also produces alcohol as a by-product in the stomach environment once ingested, so raw bread dough exposures can develop complications of alcohol toxicity as well (see above). Chocolate, coffee, and caffeine are similar in that their toxicity concerns stem from their methylxanthine concentrations (a group of compounds found in these products). When ingested by pets, methylxanthines can cause vomiting and diarrhea, panting, excessive thirst and urination, hyperactivity, abnormal heart rhythm, tremors, seizures and even death. The darker (higher cacao percentage) the chocolate, or the higher the caffeine content, the greater the risk for toxicity. White chocolate has the lowest methylxanthine content while baking chocolate and cocoa powder have the highest concentrations. Because pets do not possess significant amounts of lactase (the enzyme that breaks down lactose in milk), milk and other dairy-based products can cause diarrhea or other digestive upset. Raw meat and raw eggs can contain bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli that can be harmful to pets and humans alike. Raw eggs contain an enzyme that can interfere with absorption of certain vitamins, leading to skin/coat problems. Feeding your pet raw bones may seem like a natural and healthy option that might occur if your pet lived in the wild, however, this can be dangerous for a domestic pet. Dogs/cats might sustain injury or obstruction to the gastrointestinal tract when ingesting bones, which could be serious and require surgery.

Horses, donkeys and ruminants can develop swelling of the head/neck in addition to cardiac concerns. Citrus The stems, leaves, peels, fruit and seeds of citrus plants contain varying amounts of citric acid and essential oils that can cause irritation and possibly even depression if ingested in significant quantities. Small ingestions, such as eating the fruit, are not likely to present problems beyond minor stomach upset.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Havanese The Havanese is a descendent of the barbichon family of dogs, which in turn descend from the barbet, a large water dog behind the Poodle. The barbichon family was centered around the Mediterranean. Spanish traders brought some of these dogs with them when they traveled, giving them to Cuban women. The dogs became pampered pets in Cuba, especially favored with the upper class. They became known as the Habenero. Eventually some of these dogs were brought back to Europe, where they were called white Cubans. Here they became popular both as pets and as performing dogs. Their popularity as pets waned, and their numbers dwindled, but they remained popular as trick performers in the circus. In the 1950s and 60s, three families left Cuba for the United States, bringing their dogs with them. Most present-day Havanese descend from these dogs, with some input from later imports. The AKC recognized the Havanese in 1999. Makes an affectionate and exuberant companion. Playful, gentle and very good with children. Very friendly to strangers, other dogs and other pets. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Eager to please, bright and responsive. Makes a lively and alert housedog. A walk around the block once or twice daily, plus a vigorous game, will meet its exercise needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many Havanese have been trained to use indoor potty systems. Dog parks can work out well as long as Havanese are not expected to mingle with much larger dogs. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thick coat provides some protection against cold weather, but its fairly small body size nonetheless makes it vulnerable to the cold. Coat is long, and ranges from straight to curly, with wavy preferred. Brushing and combing two to four times a week is necessary to prevent matting. Shedding is below average. No breed is actually non-allergenic, but Havanese may cause fewer allergies compared to most other breeds. Havanese tend to stay in good weight. The thick coat can sometimes obscure weight problems, so be sure to use your hands to feel. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Dalmatian probably did not originate there. The breed's ancestry, place and time of origin, and original function are unknown. Distinctly spotted dogs have been depicted in art from ancient times, but it's not known if they were related to Dalmatians. Early jobs probably included war dog, sentinel, draft dog, herding dog, ratter, retriever, bird dog, and trick dog. The breed found its niche as a coach dog in Victorian England. Coach dogs trotted alongside, in front of, or beneath the coach, protecting the horses from marauding dogs, and looking good in the process. Its role as a coach dog for horse-drawn fire engines led to its adoption as a firehouse dog. The AKC recognized the Dalmatian in 1888. The popular Disney movie, 101 Dalmatians, fueled a surge in popularity, followed by a subsequent plunge. When the movie's sequel came out, it included disclaimers asking viewers not to get a Dalmatian on impulse. The second movie caused a much smaller surge. Dalmatians have experienced a 97 per cent drop in registrations over the past decade. Makes a playful and adventurous family member. Good and playful with children, although may be too energetic for small children. Affectionate and demonstrative. Loves to run, and may roam if the opportunity arises. Outgoing toward strangers. May be aggressive toward strange dogs, but is good with family dogs. Usually good with household pets. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Deaf dogs can be trained with hand signals and vibrating collars. Makes a fairly calm and alert housedog if given adequate exercise. If not given enough exercise, can be overactive and destructive. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, or preferably, long jog. A well-fenced yard is essential. Games can also help provide exercise. Enjoys cold weather, but its short coat doesn't protect it against prolonged exposure. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is short and glossy. It requires brushing once a week to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Dalmatians are born white; the dots come later. Dalmatians tend to stay in good weight or to be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Many Dalmatians form urinary stones, most commonly urate stones. These stones may be managed in part by feeding certain prescription dog foods that are low in certain types of protein that yield purine. Liver and other organ meats are high in purine and should be avoided in these dogs. Eggs and vegetables are low in purine. A diet low in purines, moderate in high-quality protein, high in complex carbohydrates, and low in fat and salt is suggested for urate-forming Dalmatians. Your veterinarian is the best source of information for your Dalmatian's special dietary needs. High water intake may also help prevent stones Jogging Partner 5 out of 5 Lap Dog 1 out of 5 Good With Children 3 out of 5 Warm Weather 3 out of 5 Cold Weather 2 out of 5 Grooming Requirements 1 out of 5 Shedding 3 out of 5 Barking 2 out of 5 Ease Of Training 3 out of 5 About Us Contact Us Find a Hospital Location Directory Press Center Social Responsibility Career Opportunities Opens in New Window Grow Your Hospital Sitemap Opens in New Window Opens in New Window Opens in New Window Opens in New Window"

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Lhasa Apso Recent DNA studies indicate that the Lhasa Apso is among the 14 most ancient breeds recognized by the AKC. The Lhasa apso is an ancient breed from Tibet, where it was revered in the villages and monasteries. The dogs acted as monastery lookouts, sounding the alarm at the arrival of visitors. This gave rise to their native name of Abso Seng Kye, which means bark lion sentinel dog. The name Lhasa apso may be derived from this. The souls of llamas were believed to enter the dogs' bodies after the llamas died, which added to the reverence given these dogs. When the breed first came to England in the early 1900s, it was called the Lhassa terrier. The breed came to America around 1930. It was recognized by the AKC in 1935. At that time it was assigned to the terrier group, but it was reassigned to the Non-sporting group in 1959. The Lhasa's popularity has risen slowly but steadily in the last two decades Makes a loyal and entertaining companion. Playful and good with children. A one family dog, tending to be aloof toward strangers. Early socialization so that it willingly accepts new people is important. Generally friendly toward other dogs and pets. Tends to be bold, stubborn and independent, which makes training using force methods extremely unproductive. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Some tend to bark a lot. Housetraining can be more challenging than with many other breeds. Makes an active and alert housedog. Although many of its physical exercise needs can be met with indoor games, it still needs the mental stimulation of walking and sniffing outdoors. A walk around the block once or twice daily will meet its outdoor needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many Lhasas have been trained to use indoor potty systems. Does well at dog parks as well as it is separated from large dogs. Does not tend to enjoy hot weather. Swimming is not recommended unless constantly supervised. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Coat is long, hard and straight. Brushing and combing every other day is necessary to prevent mats. Many pet owners elect to have their dogs professionally groomed, or clipped into a trim that is more easily cared for. Hair must be kept out of eyes to avoid irritation. The hair around the anus must be checked daily for hygiene issues. Shedding is below average. Lhasa apsos tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Bloodhound The bloodhound is probably a direct descendent of the St. Hubert's hound, which was in Europe by the 700s. In 1066, William the Conqueror is credited with bringing them to England. These were some of the earliest pure-breeding strains of dogs, kept by Church dignitaries in carefully bred packs. The name bloodhound comes from ""blooded hound,"" in reference to their pure blood. By the 1800s, bloodhounds were in America. Bloodhounds, along with other scenthounds, were sometimes used to trail escaped slaves. They continue to be used to trail humans. They do not attack people when they find them, as is sometimes alleged. The AKC recognized the bloodhound in 1885. Bloodhounds hold tracking records for length and staleness of trail. Makes a placid and amiable companion. Good with children, but its independent nature and low energy level may be frustrating for children at times. Generally friendly toward strangers. Good with other dogs and pets. Likes to follow its nose, tends to wander, and does not come when called. Likes to hunt. Often barks and bays loudly when excited or on a trail. Tends to be stubborn and methodical. Does best with reward-based training involving food. Makes a calm and reliable housedog. Its physical exercise needs can be met with a long walk or short run. It prefers to walk and sniff and explore. Care must be taken if allowed off leash because the bloodhound tends to get caught up in following scent trails, and it's not overly obedient or inclined to come when called. Bloodhounds tend to do well at dog parks. They do not like hot weather. Coat is short, thick and tight. Brushing once a week will remove dead hair. Shedding is average. The mouth and wrinkles should be examined, cleaned and dried regularly. Be prepared for drool. Bloodhounds have a tendency to become overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a large-breed growth food, which slows their growing rate but not final size. This may decrease the incidence or severity of hip dysplasia in adults.

developed at least by the 1300s to flush birds into nets or to waiting falcons. Some smaller spaniels were probably bred with Oriental toy dogs such as the Japanese chin to create a lapdog version of the spaniel. These dogs were known as comforter spaniels and were used to serve as lap and foot warmers, surrogate hot water bottles, and for companionship. In the 1700s, King Charles II became an ardent fan of the little dogs, to the point that he was accused of ignoring matters of state in favor of his dogs. The dogs were dubbed King Charles spaniels in recognition of his association. After King Charles' death, the Duke of Marlboro became an advocate of the breed. The red and white color, which he favored, is called Blenheim after his estate. The King Charles spaniel remained a favorite with the upper class, but the look of the breed gradually changed until by the early 1900s, they had pushed in faces. In 1926, a wealthy American traveled to England in search of the old type dogs with a longer nose. Unable to find any, he offered a large cash prize to the best old type pointy-nosed dogs at the next year's shows. The challenge set breeders to reviving the old type, which then became known as the Cavalier King Charles spaniel. After World War II, only a handful of Cavaliers remained. Six dogs became the foundation of the modern breed. The Kennel Club in England recognized the Cavalier in 1945. But only when a Cavalier won Best in Show at the prestigious Crufts dog show did the breed capture the public's attention. Cavaliers came to America in the 1940s. Fanciers disagreed, however, over whether they wanted AKC recognition. The AKC recognized the Cavalier in 1996 amidst great controversy. To this day, there are two separate national Cavalier clubs, one AKC affiliated and one not. In the past decade, Cavaliers have had a 735 per cent increase in AKC registrations, more than any other breed. Makes a loving and entertaining companion. Extremely good with children.

Shedding is average. Cavaliers have a tendency to become overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Puppies should be fed a balanced a puppy food.

terriers, smooth fox terriers, and perhaps whippets. Later breeds that may have played a role included the beagle, Italian greyhound, miniature pinscher and Chihuahua. Mixes of these breeds came from dogs brought to America by working class immigrants from Britain in the late 1800s. Rat terriers were used for both vermin control and for rat pit contests, where men bet on how many rats in a pit a dog could kill in a certain time period. A rat terrier holds the rat killing record of 2501 rats in a seven hour period in an infested barn. President Theodore Roosevelt hunted with these dogs and even kept some in the White House. He is credited with naming them rat terriers. The Rat terrier has traditionally been viewed as a strain, rather than a breed, of dog, which means that crossing to other breeds and mixes has been permissible throughout most of its history. The modern incarnation of this practice is probably the feist, a strain of small terrier-like hunting dogs used to catch squirrels and other rodents. Because it has been bred as a strain with used to hunt game of varied size, the rat terrier comes in a great range of sizes. Rat terriers were popular farm dogs by the early 1900s; in fact, although no statistics are available, they were probably among the most popular dogs in America. With the advent of pesticides in the 1950s, the rat terrier's popularity as a working vermin hunter declined. By that time, however, the breed had a following because of it attributes as a companion. Several breed clubs now exist, but they disagree about what the best course is for the future of the breed. The National Rat Terrier Association has maintained breeding records for decades and is opposed to recognition by major kennel clubs. The United Kennel Club recognized the rat terrier in 1999. The Rat Terrier Club of America is working toward AKC recognition. It is recognized by the AKC Foundation Stock Service, which makes it eligible to compete in many AKC performance events. Makes a loyal and energetic companion. Playful and very good with children. Somewhat reserved with strangers May be cocky and even scrappy with other dogs. May not be good with small pets, and is especially ill-advised around rodents. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Eager to please, and learns quickly, but is easily bored and distracted. Some may bark a lot. Makes an alert housedog. This is a very active and playful dog. A daily walk around the block, coupled with several play sessions, will help meet its exercise needs. May not do well in dog parks unless large dogs are segregated from small dogs. Even so, some rat terriers may bully other small dogs. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Its thin coat and small size makes it vulnerable to chilling. Coat is smooth, hard and short. Brushing once a week will remove dead hair. Shedding is average. Rat terriers tend to stay in good weight or be slightly overweight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Small snacks can cause weight problems in very small dogs. Tiny rat terrier puppies should be fed often to prevent hypoglycemia, a serious condition to which very small puppies are prone. Frequent small meals of high protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates may help guard against this condition.

the Spanish Pointer was crossed with a scent trailing hound called the Hannover Hound to produce a dog that could both trail and point mammals and birds. The dog could even dispatch wounded game, including fox. Later crosses to English Pointers gave the dogs a more stylish look and a hunting style that was less scenthound like; that is, a nose-up style of locating game. The dogs became known as Deutsch Kurzhaars. In the early 1800s two of the dogs, named Nero and Treff, so distinguished themselves at the German Derby that their progeny became sought after. They are considered the foundation of the modern breed. The first Shorthair came to America in the 1920s. The AKC recognized the breed in 1930. Although the German Wirehaired Pointer tends to be more popular in Germany, the German Shorthaired Pointer quickly became more favored in America as both a hunting dog and companion. Makes an energetic and protective family member. Gentle and playful with children, although may be too boisterous for small children. Demanding of attention. Loves to run and hunt. Moderately outgoing toward strangers. Usually good with other dogs. Can be somewhat aggressive toward other pets. Learns quickly. Does best with a firm owner who can combine reward-based training with good control and leadership. Some can whine or bark a lot. Makes a fairly calm and alert housedog if given adequate exercise. If not given enough exercise, can be overactive and destructive. Requires daily exercise in the form of a long walk, or preferably, long jog. Vigorous games are also helpful. A well-fenced yard is essential. Hunting is the favored exercise. Swimming and retrieving are also favorites. This is not a breed for an inactive owner. Obedience training is essential not only for control, but for the mental exercise it provides. Coat is short and tough. It requires brushing once a week to remove dead hair. Shedding is average. GSPs tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight.

Hospital Locator Hospitals by State Hospital Locator Hospitals by State myVCA Search Shopping Cart Home Know Your Pet Dog Breeds Yorkshire Terrier In the late 1800s, England's Industrial Revolution attracted many workers from Scotland, who brought with them a variety of terriers. These terriers included the blue and silver Paisley and the blue and tan Clydesdale, both dogs with long silky coats and prick ears. These dogs interbred with the native English terriers, which included the 10 pound Waterside terrier, a breed that excelled at ratting. In addition, crosses were made to a cross-bred Scotch terrier, an old style Skye terrier, and an Old English terrier. These dogs became the foundation of the Yorkshire terrier, a breed originally used to rid the mills of rats. With the emergence of dog shows in the 1860s, many high society women turned their attention to pedigreed dogs that could look stylish on their mistress's lap, and the Yorkshire terrier fit the bill. Huddersfield Ben (1865-1871) became the first influential show dog and sire. The breed was exhibited as Broken Haired Scotch terriers until 1870, when the name was changed to Yorkshire terrier at the suggestion of a reporter. Yorkshire terriers were in America by the 1870s AKC recognized the breed in 1885. Yorkies remained fairly unknown until the 1970s, when their popularity began a slow, steady rise. In 1995 they entered the top ten list of AKC's most popular breeds, and have only continued to rise. Makes a delightful and entertaining companion. Playful and good with children, but children must be supervised because they could easily hurt such a small dog. True to its terrier heritage, it is spunky, busy, and often mischievous. Tends to pick fights with larger dogs, and may chase small pets, especially rodents. A one family dog, tending to be aloof toward strangers. Early socialization so that it willingly accepts new people is important. Does best with reward-based training involving food or games. Learns quickly, but also bores quickly, and may come up with its own ideas. Some tend to bark a lot, which should be discouraged from an early age. Housetraining can be more challenging than with many other breeds. Makes a lively and alert housedog. Although many of its physical exercise needs can be met with indoor games, it still needs the mental stimulation of walking and sniffing outdoors. A walk around the block once or twice daily will meet its outdoor needs, not counting bathroom breaks. Many Yorkies have been trained to use indoor potty systems. Dog parks are not generally a good idea unless only small dogs are allowed together. Swimming is not recommended unless constantly supervised. Swimming with a full coat could be dangerous. Games and tricks provide needed mental exercise. Excursions in doggy purses can also provide entertainment. Coat is long, fine and perfectly straight. Adult color is dark steel blue with tan points. Young puppies are black and tan, with the black gradually turning gray and then blue as adults. Brushing and combing every day or two is necessary to prevent matts. Many pet owners elect to have their dogs professionally groomed, or clipped into a trim that is more easily cared for. Hair must be kept out of eyes to avoid irritation. The hair around the anus must be checked daily for hygiene issues. Shedding is below average. Regular tooth brushing may prevent periodontal disease, which is common in Yorkies. Yorkshire terriers tend to stay in good weight. Adult dogs should be fed a balanced diet, with restricted calories if the dog starts to gain too much weight. Yorkie puppies should be fed often to prevent hypoglycemia, a serious condition to which very small puppies are prone. Meals of high protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates may also help guard against this condition.
